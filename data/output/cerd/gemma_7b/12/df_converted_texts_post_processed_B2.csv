Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their careers. To be successful in today's world, you need to be more than just skilled. You also need to be able to communicate effectively, be open-minded, and be able to build relationships.
There are a number of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you love and that allows you to use your skills and talents. Another is to be able to work in a supportive and collaborative environment. Finally, it is important to be able to find a sense of purpose in your work.
However, there are also a number of challenges that can make work less fulfilling. One is stress and burnout. Another is the feeling of being stuck in a rut. Finally, it is the feeling of not being appreciated or respected.
If you are feeling unfulfilled in your work, there are a number of things you can do. You can talk to your boss about your concerns, or you can look for a new job. You can also try to find ways to make your work more enjoyable, such as by taking on new challenges or by working with a team of people you enjoy."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.
The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate. Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium.
However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television."

Sometimes it feels like no matter how much stuff you have, you don't feel secure. Having a home that meets your needs is reasonable, but there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities. It's designed to make us feel like we need things to be happy. We are constantly being exposed to advertising messages - on TV, the radio, newspapers, magazines, and the internet. They all encourage us to buy, buy, buy.
Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years. But because they require physical agility, cave research has been less in the hands of academics than other scientific fields. However, there is a lot of overlap between professional and amateur cave research.
Meteorology is the study of weather. It started with simple observations made by people who used their senses. Today, meteorology is a highly technical science. Satellites and electronic instruments relay weather information quickly. Computers can solve complex mathematical problems at a speed that humans can't even imagine. But human experience is still the most important part of meteorology. It's the one that translates data into weather forecasts."

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first in opera. The music is the foundation of the performance, and it is what makes the event truly captivating.
In contrast to music audiences, theatre audiences have different expectations. They mainly understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly impressed by long and difficult speeches. However, they are often awestruck by the skill of the performers.
There are some similarities between music and theatre audiences. They both appreciate the artistry and passion of the performers. They also understand the importance of creating a shared experience.
In order to improve the relationship between music and theatre, I believe that there is a need to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. This could be achieved through innovative approaches, such as staging operas in unconventional locations or using new technologies to create a more immersive experience for audiences.
I want both music and theatre to thrive, and for more and more people to experience the joy of being an audience."

Sand is a nuisance when it's in its natural state. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you like 'stucco'. It's hard to get rid of sand, even with a fireman's hose. But, when you step onto a beach towel or climb into a car, the sand falls off. It can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.
A lock and key have been used for a long time to keep people out of places. They provide a sense of security and privacy. But people don't like computerised locking systems. They prefer to use physical keys. So, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure to incorporate a proper metal key into the device.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.
The film studios The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a complex place. It possessed a few permanent landmarks such as the Script Department, but it also appeared to be made up of numerous small rooms, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations. To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a solitary person. She was as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She had a strong personality and was known for her strict rules and her obsession with cleanliness. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked.
I remember my mother taking me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. Here, hand-in-hand, we would parade through roomfuls of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification."

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was thick. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses down the street that I remembered. They had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. Wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses that had once been homes had become stores, and the stores that had once been homes had become houses again. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?
I swam in the pool. The warm rain tumbled from the gutter. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm intensified, drowning birdsong, and a haze rose off the water as though the pool itself were rising to meet the lowering sky. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage."

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social significance. It can help to develop the attachment between mother and child. Tears can also be used to express sympathy for those suffering terrible injustice. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues."

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We know that human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases, which are closely related to global temperature. We also know that the average annual global surface temperature has increased by between 1C and 3.5C since 1950.
The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. For example, the average sea level is rising, and extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, are becoming more frequent. These changes are having a negative impact on many ecosystems and human societies.
The most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the rise in sea levels. This is caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe."

Aesthetics is a field that studies the nature of beauty and art. However, the existence of artworks often hinders the understanding of aesthetic theory. This is because artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they exist. This separation of artworks from human experience creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.
The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events. When what we know as art is relegated to the museum and gallery, the unconquerable impulse towards experiences enjoyable in themselves finds such outlet as the daily environment provides."

The early 1990s were a tough time for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.
There are a number of factors that have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult. These include the economic situation, the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take risks. Other events that have made it difficult to produce effective advertising include demographic changes, the rise of the retailer, and the changing needs and desires of consumers."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Reading and travel can escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in national events and individual activities. It provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal. Playing an instrument can have many benefits, including improving cognitive skills, social relationships, and concentration. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can help develop transferable skills such as punctuality and organization. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the long term, there are likely to be some changes in the way music is enjoyed and made. These changes will require the music profession to adapt and evolve.

The craft of acting is often met with disdain and contempt. Many actors fall into the trap of talking about their craft in interviews, instead of giving the dancer Pavlova's reply: 'If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it.' They should focus on the execution of their craft rather than engage in ponderous cliches or gossip.
When it comes to acting, there are no rules. With every play and playwright, the actor starts from scratch, learning anew and growing with the relationships of the characters and the insights of the writer. The emptiness of any discussion of theatre work is apparent in any discussion of theatre work.

The father read the words while the son fiddled with the pictures. 'Had he spent ten minutes in front of a book, he might possibly have learned something,' said his father. Television is an impressionistic, suggestive medium. Learning goes on in a learning environment where dialogue is taking place with teachers or parents. It needs to be mediated. There is nothing wrong with harnessing new technology to teach our children, but there is still a big role for formal education.

Blogging: Confessing to the world
Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing everything on the internet.
There are a lot of benefits to blogging, such as wealth and fame. But there are also risks, such as being fired from your job or having your privacy violated.
In the early days of the web, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started blogging. He was one of the first bloggers, and he showed that you can use blogging to share your life with the world.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. The photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
Throughout history, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image. Photography has been seen as a way to provide a truthful visual record. It has also been held to be an achievement of sophisticated culture and produced the type of image that artists had struggled throughout the centuries to acquire.

It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are a popular way to enjoy poetry. There are two main types of poetry recitals: those that are intended to be printed and read on the page, and those that are intended to be performed live. The poets who write for the page tend to be more serious and dedicated to their craft, while the poets who perform live tend to be more popular and accessible. There are a number of benefits to attending poetry recitals, such as the ability to learn about the art of poetry and to appreciate the beauty of poetry. However, attendance at poetry recitals cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page.

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture
The growing trend of historians to rely on oral evidence has its challenges. It is difficult to determine whether someone's testimony accurately reflects the past. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Students who come to study a social science for the first time must familiarize themselves with the substance and methodology of the subject. Each discipline of the social sciences focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses particular methods of study.
Classical architecture was much more than the mere construction of buildings. It was an art form that emphasized aesthetics over function. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, in essence, the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut."

The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to grant this. On the road Lily had actually overtaken a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve and such timing that Mui had pressed her lips closely together against her own protest.
The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances. Taken aback, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the two sisters to look at the grey barbarian sea. He perched Son on the top railing and put his arms around his stomach.
Chen resolved to bring Son up his way. He would have an education in figures (Chen's own weak point) and grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience in all aspects of the trade on the way. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career."

I had read somewhere that from a deep hole, one could see the stars. I had persuaded you to help me with my plan. I climbed into the well and plunged. I fell into the well and cracked my head. I saw strange lights and felt frightened and relieved. You called down, asking if I was all right. I lay still and waited for help. I was pulled out of the well and landed on the courtyard cobbles. I ran away and hid in the shadows. My mother and father appeared along with you. My father shouted and told Arthur to haul on the winch handle. I stood back, looking pale and shocked. I felt elation and looked at the line of drops I'd left. I felt horrified and ashamed. I knew I had to do something. I gathered all my courage and came out of hiding. I cried out and stumbled on a little further. I collapsed dramatically on the cobbles. I sat up and smiled bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. My father was disbelieving. He rose smoothly to his feet and walked away. I felt pity and remorse. I knew I had done something wrong."

The Internet has opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits is that it has made book reviews accessible to everyone. Anyone can visit Amazon.com and read or write reviews. This has led to a lot of mischief, but it has also made it easier for authors to connect with their readers.
The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com are serious and provide a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods is worth buying. However, there is also a lot of silliness. For example, one writer wrote a review that compared the book to the architecture of the Internet. Another writer wrote a review that praised the book for providing a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts.
Overall, the democratisation of literary criticism has been a positive development. It has made book reviews more accessible to everyone and has also made it easier for authors to connect with their readers."

Art in modern times, has become more prominent over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we tend to get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. This is often due to our expectations for art to be puzzling and new. We require artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive, so vigorous that conventions cannot contain them.
Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds. An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book and writes it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting.
The exhibition ""Underground Encounters"" showcases paintings and drawings of the London Underground. It is a popular exhibition because it conforms to the unspoken rule of commercial success as a painter. If you are interested in art, you should definitely check out ""Underground Encounters."""

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The overcrowded tube journey had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead and the smell of dinner from the kitchen. He remembered his grandmother's insistence that the returning breadwinner should be given peace and relief from petty domestic anxieties. The job was important to Lois and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia."

I chose this place to live, hoping to find anonymity. But people in the shops soon start to recognise me. The roses pouring over the fence are reminders that the gardens were loved once. I usually stay inside trying to forget that there is a summer going on out there, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying in the transparent space between the treetops and roofs.

I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing presents and mall-order goodies to other houses.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower, more purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy."

I have been welcomed warmly to a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very isolated place. There are a lot of people living there, mostly scientists, students, and weathermen. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely, or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Dr Johnson believed that writing without effort is generally read without pleasure. Good writing comes hard. The author's handwritten school essays contained few crossings-out. Today, the author would have rewritten them five times over. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. The casual facility of the computer leads to sloppiness.

The author argues that reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most never do it. Books have a long history and offer a more joined-up thinking experience than electronic text. The organization of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text rather than read it in its entirety.

England's breakfast revolution. A good breakfast is important according to health experts. In historical terms, breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England. There are some references to travellers having a meal at dawn and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast. As individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours, often starting work extremely early, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content.

Climate and weather are also important factors that affect our lives. They can create a big difference in the distribution of animals and plants. For example, warm and wet climates can support the growth of tropical jungles, which are home to a wide variety of species. Cold and windy climates can only support a few living things.
The weather patterns that make up the climate are caused by the movement of air. Air rises and mixes with other air masses, and this motion creates turbulence.

It also bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface in its search for insect larvae. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations.

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but few of us know what their lives were like. We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing.
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each."

From here to paternity, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children. I have loved every minute of it. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond.
I have been a father for many years. I have experienced both the joys and challenges of fatherhood. I have made some mistakes, but I have always tried to be there for my children. I am proud of the person I have become because of my children.

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the aircraft became weightless and floated aimlessly for 20 seconds. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.

I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot. I've always been very keen and enthusiastic about land. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres. The planting process was hard work, but it was also very satisfying. I enjoy hard physical work, and it certainly made me fit. The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were fed every four hours and eventually they were weaned on to creamed rice. After a few months, they were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hardboiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening.
The cubs were playful and would chase each other's tails. I also saw odder badgers in our field. We built a sett for the badgers and they moved into it. Now, I see the cubs only occasionally, but they still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.

Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer and geophysicist who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass, which are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various places, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and England. From these travels, he published a chart that proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific merit. It will involve making precise measurements of the terrestrial magnetic field and refining the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.
Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England and has a strong understanding of navigation and geomagnetism. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews."

Peacocks that live at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. Wallace, on the other hand, believed that the peacocks' trains were used for sexual selection. The debate between Darwin and Wallace continues to this day.
The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are trying to settle the matter once and for all. They are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to see if the hens really do choose the males with the showiest trains. They have found that the hens do like the showiest males, but they are not sure if the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways.
There is a final twist to this story. Fisher's Runaway theory suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the rest, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This process will continue to repeat itself, and eventually, the males with the longest tails will get most mates and leave most offspring."

The best boat design should combine old and new. Tom Cunliffe says that this is the case. He designed his own craft, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has benefited from all the magic of old-fashioned boat design, but it would have been a much harder job without the advances of modern know-how. However, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life. This is often the very reality that sailors hoped to rediscover by going to sea in the first place.
My own boat is a humble craft that lies quietly on a tidal creek off the south coast. It was designed last year, but seeing her, you might imagine her to be 100 years old. Despite being an indispensable tool in current design methods and boat-building practice, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life.
When I bought my boat, Hirta, I realised that she had every comfort, but no luxury. She taught me how wise he was. Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and absolutely no electronics. Back on land, however, it is a sad fact that the very antiquity of classic boats means that they need a lot of looking after.
The Westerman has never disappointed me. Although she is a beautiful boat, she is also very strong and durable. She is made of timber treated with a penetrating glue, which makes her totally impervious to water. Thus she has all the benefits of a glass fibre boat yet looks like, feels like and sails like the real thing."

In the past few million years, humans have not developed any significant differences from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities exist between humans and animals. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.
There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity. However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

The most popular theory states that sleep is primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. A second theory emphasizes the learning benefits of sleep. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day. A third theory is based on ideas about energy, saying that we need periods of sleep in order to recharge our batteries.

Someone who behaves abnormally or refuses to conform to the accepted norms of society is called eccentric. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity. The desire to be accepted and loved is stronger than the desire to stand out in the crowd. People who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems. The most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics are not people who deliberately try to be odd, they simply are odd."

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in the world of chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. The game is becoming longer and there is more pressure on the players. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire."

Volunteer tourism is a topic that is discussed by four academic writers. They argue that while volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, the actual contribution to development is often not as great as it seems. However, volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, widespread and democratic participation in global affairs, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities."

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. One common way to wake up is the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available models.
The 'dual alarm function' does not allow you to be woken up by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends.
We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses and telephone.'
The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.
The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'."

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked. The effectiveness of this defence mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They may place their fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale, to enhance this. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store.
Supermarkets also use lighting to attract shoppers. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.
Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'.

Advertising is not doing well. It started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. As brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are.
If you visit a supermarket, you will probably buy a few advertised brands, but not many. You will probably buy a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands.
The truth is nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. The advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments.
If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly. So, any advertising campaign, for any product, which could win over 2 per cent of the population would be outstandingly successful."

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. There is a monastic stillness in the house. The Vales designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. They also designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and inexpensive to run.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought they were real. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered."

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for centuries. They have been responsible for providing weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used as they once were, but there has been a recent revival in interest in the craft.
The blacksmiths craft is unique because the metal is incredibly soft when it is hot, but becomes rigid and immovable when it cools down. This makes it a challenging medium to work with, but also a rewarding one.
There are many different types of blacksmithing, including decorative blacksmithing, which is the focus of this text. Decorative blacksmithing involves creating items for aesthetic purposes, such as gates, railings, and sculptures.
The blacksmiths craft is a valuable one and it is important to preserve it for future generations. There are a number of events happening over the next few weeks that aim to promote the blacksmiths craft. These events will provide an opportunity for people to learn more about blacksmithing and to see some beautiful examples of the craft."

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was furious. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I suppose my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours later was slightly irritating. The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not particularly want to. For one thing, I resented the pressure from the anti-smoking mob - and I still do. For another, I had low blood pressure and a long-living and healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and threw off colds more easily, it seemed to me, than friends with consciously healthier lifestyles. On that day, I had simply gone to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to give up. I could not have been more reasonable. After all, I positively enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me rather knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wished and most of the afternoon was conducted in a room so smoke-filled that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others. I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense. The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world? In many senses, it was easy. The physical craving, the pangs of desire for nicotine, faded after a minute or two. The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order. Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing - and it still is."

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist who won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1964 for her work on penicillin and vitamin B12. She was also a mother of three and wife to a historian. Hodgkin's life reflects some of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century, including the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.
There are a few challenges associated with writing a biography of a scientist. One challenge is that scientists often avoid personal appearances and interviews. Another challenge is that scientific ideas can be difficult to understand for many people. However, Hodgkin's biography is a good example of how to write a compelling scientific biography that is accessible to a wide audience."

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense' that allows her to locate water. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. After the map has indicated likely areas, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the straight part of the stick rises up.
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?"

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere.
B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again.
C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep in late. After that it was time for a maths class and a nature project. The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming, anyway!
D. Hilary's story I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day."

A trumpet player named Hakan Hardenberger is unique because he comes from a family that is not musical. He has established himself as one of the best trumpet players in the world. His records are opening up new repertory, including concertos by long-neglected composers. When you meet him, he seems even younger than his years and has a bright and open personality. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in London. He owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father gave him a genuine grown-up trumpet, and his mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson. Bo was an up-and-coming musician and spotted natural talent in Hardenberger. From the very start, Hardenberger has had the gift of finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. He has a particular gift of communicating and can move people through his music."

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.
To photograph people effectively, you should follow these tips:
1. Group people in a way that is visually appealing.
2. Help your subject relax and pose naturally.
3. Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
4. Use eye contact or gestures to engage the viewer.
5. Consider the overall composition of the picture, including the subject and the background.
6. Take candid pictures of events as they happen.
By following these tips, you can take better pictures of people and capture their personality and expression."

Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. It comprises basic elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.
In the new workplace, emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world. It is a crucial set of skills that can help people work together smoothly towards their common goal.
More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a valuable component of management philosophy. If a person has a deficiency in emotional intelligence, it can hinder the use of whatever technical expertise or intellect they may have.
Emotional intelligence can be learned and added to one's tool kit for survival. It is especially relevant at a time when it seems a contradiction to put the words 'job' and 'stability' together."

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy flow through the body. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.
Acupuncture can be effective for treating chronic pain, back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine. It is also used during surgery.
Traditional acupuncturists believe that acupuncture is most effective when used in conjunction with traditional Chinese medicine. They also believe that it can bring about deep changes that lead to a longer cure."

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.
Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as deviousness, intelligence, and confidence. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other serious problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them."

The office environment has a significant impact on employee health and happiness. A new survey found that fresh air and the right chairs are key to creating a positive working atmosphere. The study visited four contrasting offices to assess their health and happiness levels. The expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist.
Office A is a small, dynamic team office with a simple and straightforward layout. The lack of central heating and mechanical ventilation is compensated for by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators. The office is cozy and comfortable, but the furniture is not ergonomic.
Office B is a comfortable and well-maintained office with good air quality and general maintenance standards. However, the space is impersonal and unstimulating. Office C is a glass case office with a mix of smokers and non-smokers. Despite the air conditioning control issues, the office is relatively comfortable. Office D is a dusty and cluttered office with inadequate desk space and poor air conditioning control.

Chewing gum culture is fashionable, classless, and popular in the United States. Americans chew 12 million sticks of gum a day. Gum is a food that contains fewer than ten calories per stick. Today's gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree. American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees. Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree. Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands."
