Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be a source of stress and dissatisfaction. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be willing to learn new things. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to compete in the job market.

In addition to the above, you also need to be able to work well with others. This means that you need to be able to cooperate, be empathetic, and be able to build strong relationships. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to be successful in your career.

There are a number of things that you can do to improve your work life. First, you need to make sure that you are communicating effectively. This means that you need to be able to listen to others, be able to express yourself clearly, and be able to build strong relationships. Second, you need to be creative and willing to learn new things. Third, you need to be able to work well with others. If you can do these things, you will be more likely to be successful in your career.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television.<eos>"

Sometimes it seems that no matter how much stuff you have, you don't feel secure. It is good to have a home that meets your needs, but there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. If you don't have one of these things, you will be a lesser human being. To see how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.

Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years. Because of their presence as natural phenomena, caves have had a long history of study. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields.

Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere. Countless observant people originally laid the foundations of meteorology. Satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us with the minimum of delay. Computers solve complex mathematical sums at a speed beyond the capability of the human brain. Meteorological theory is complex, but human experience is still the vital ingredient which translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily theatre, while music comes first in an opera. Music is inherently theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, and vulnerability. It can reach into the imagination of the listener not just as an individual but as part of a collective.

The conventions which still largely dominate music presentation, including strict dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasize the difference between players and listeners in a way which often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. The tendency of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a canicular piece of virtuosity can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the whole work.

There are a few things that can be done to change the conventions of music-going. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. Some plays get put on in unconventional locations, where normal expectations are disrupted. These locations can have startling effects on performer and audience alike.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.

The film studios The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a confusing place. It was made up of numerous small rooms, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations. To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing.

So I've only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film.""<eos>"

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung round the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.

My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.

My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. As a child, I had some notion of the oddity of her personality. She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate.

Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.<eos>"

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was high. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses on the street, and I remembered them all. The houses had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses had become stores, and the stores had become homes. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?

I swam in the pool. The warm rain tumbled from the gutter. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm intensified, drowning birdsong, and a haze rose off the water as though the pool itself were rising to meet the lowering sky. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer due to human activity. This is causing changes to the weather and the planet's climate. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water and soils. They are also having a significant impact on human societies.

The main cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth's atmosphere to warm up. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased significantly over the last 100 years. This is due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

Climate change is causing a number of changes to the planet's climate. These changes include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in the timing of seasons, and changes in the distribution of ecosystems. These changes are having a negative impact on many human societies.

The most severe consequences of climate change are rising sea levels and increased flooding. Rising sea levels are caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the melting of glaciers. Increased flooding is a major problem for coastal communities around the world. It can damage infrastructure, destroy homes and livelihoods, and displace people.<eos>"

The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel. Fuel efficiency is a priority. The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031. It's a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies.

Aesthetics is a field that studies the nature of beauty and art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. This makes it difficult to understand how artworks relate to human experiences. Additionally, the perfection of some artworks and their long history of admiration create conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When artworks are isolated from their original conditions and experiences, they become difficult to understand. To understand artworks, we need to forget them for a time and turn aside from them. Instead, we need to focus on the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. This means that we need to arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. Once we have done this, we can appreciate artworks in their raw form and enjoy them as part of our daily experiences.<eos>"

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, alongside these psychological and financial imperatives lies an almost paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there's some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Reading a great book guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is used in many different ways, including national events, individual activities, and education. It is also beneficial to our health and well-being.

There are a few things that need to be done in order to ensure that music continues to have a positive impact on our lives. First, we need to make music more accessible to everyone. This means providing more opportunities for people to learn to play instruments and to participate in music-related activities. Second, we need to support the music profession. This means providing professional musicians with the resources they need to be successful. Third, we need to raise the profile of music itself. This means making people aware of the many benefits of music and encouraging them to listen to and enjoy it.<eos>"

Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing everything on the internet.

Metals and St Ives

A long time ago, people in Stone Age times found a shiny yellow pebble that was different from stone. It was attractive and became a valuable material. People also discovered copper and used it to make tools. Metalworking was added to the list of accomplishments that helped people to live better.

It has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Photography has changed radically since its invention in 1839. It has moved into what might be termed 'mythic time' and has passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document.<eos>"

Poetry writing is like walking through a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and avoid making any false steps. If you set yourself up as an expert, you're more likely to make a mistake. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination. You can also write to express your feelings or to share your ideas. There are different ways to write poetry, but the most important thing is to find your own style.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or long narratives. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story. Dialogue is more useful than long explanations. You need to keep the story moving and avoid overwriting.

Screenplay writing is like playing chess. The more you practice, the better you become. You need to be able to see the big picture and the patterns in the play. If you want to write a screenplay, you need to learn the basics of chess.

Writing is a human instinct, but written language is not. It is a complex skill that takes time and practice to learn. We need to understand how the minds of children work and how to get them to write.<eos>"

I have never begun a book with more worry. If I call it a book, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals. I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving. I have taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are held at different times and places. There are two main types of poets: those who write poems to be printed and read on the page, and those who write poems to be performed to an audience. The latter poets often use simple verses and easy to understand language. They can only profit from public performance. The other poets write poems that are more complex and difficult to understand. They are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience that is encountering their work for the first time. Attendance at poetry reading cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page, though it can be an enjoyable and instructive adjunct.

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture

These are four topics that are being discussed in this text. Each topic has its own unique set of challenges and considerations.

**Oral History:**
- Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
- Memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources.
- Feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony.

**Animal Science:**
- There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal.
- The two approaches are closely related.
- The methods used to study animal behaviour are important.

**Social Sciences:**
- Students who come to study a social science for the first time must familiarise themselves with the substance and methodology of the subject.
- The social sciences are not simply a matter of common sense.
- Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life.

**Classical Architecture:**
- Architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings in the classical world.
- The origins of classical architecture are complex.
- The classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.<eos>"

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line, shooting the bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.

They drove to the English Channel and Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to grant this. They parked in a small street off the sea front and Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings.

Chen put a coin in the slot and trained the glass on the ship. He was unable to find it at first, although he had aimed off carefully. He swung the tube in wide circles and finally found the ship. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece and showed him the ship.

The ship was small and old, but Chen knew that it was the ship that would take them all back home. He kissed the top of Man Kee's head and Lily put her arm round Husband's shoulders.<eos>"

The Internet has made it easier for people to share their opinions about books. Anyone can write a review on Amazon, which is the largest online bookstore. This has led to a lot of silliness, but it also provides a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book is worth buying.

The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com are serious and provide a good indication of whether or not a book is worth reading. However, there is also a lot of silliness. For example, some people write reviews that are simply personal attacks on the author, while others write reviews that contain obscenities or give away the ending of the book. Despite this, the reviews collectively provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

There is a new situation that I am going to describe. An artist chooses a piece of text and asks someone to make a canvas for him. He then asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. The finished product is a painting.

The problem is that the art-buying public expects artists to stick to one genre. If an artist tries to strike out in a new direction, they are usually met with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side.<eos>"

Museums make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. Museums which rise to the challenge and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself. The third is slower than thought. This slower mode of thinking is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.

I have been welcomed warmly to a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very isolated place. There are a lot of people living there, but I don't have much trouble communicating. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely, or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting. He cared about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, the audience should scream at the same moment. Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable. He was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience.<eos>"

Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past fifty years. There were not many charts and catalogues, and telescopic equipment was limited. Today, there are many more charts and telescopes available. Computers have made it easier to produce charts and analyze observations. All this makes it a good time for amateur astronomy.

However, there has also been a loss of simplicity. Now you have to travel farther to find a sky that is comparable to the sky in urban areas fifty years ago. The daytime skies are now filled with aircraft condensation trails which can last for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Society is also becoming more complex. There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. This can be stressful and tiring. As a result, there is a new trend emerging: the search for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world.

We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days.<eos>"

Writing and reading are two enjoyable activities that require effort. Handwritten text is often more enjoyable to read than text written on a screen. This is because the slowness of handwriting forces the brain to focus and concentrate. It also encourages people to write more carefully.

Most writers using word processors find that the time spent correcting early drafts is more or less equates with the time originally spent on handwritten text. Similarly, the e-mail, unlike the handwritten letter, is emotionally ponderous. It is said to have revived the art of the love letter. But printed words written in haste lack the care and character of handwriting.

There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles. In the sixteenth century, it gradually became the norm to have breakfast. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content. The development of cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. Today, cartography is used in many sciences, including geology, history, and geography.<eos>"

Language is a powerful tool that humans use to communicate and express themselves. It is an instinct that people have, like spiders spinning webs. Climate and weather, which are created by the air around us, also have a big impact on our lives. They can affect the distribution of animals and plants. The daily weather patterns that add up to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing. Coffee is an important part of many people's lives. It is a drink that people enjoy and it is also a source of income for many people. Making a good cup of coffee is not easy, but it is an art and a science.<eos>"

Art and the Visual Arts

Television often fails to showcase the pleasure and complexity of looking at paintings and sculptures. There are few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of art. One example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part survey of American art, American Visions. The series focuses on the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

Metals

The metals market is regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can find insects by tapping the surface of the wood and listening for reverberations. The aye-aye can also sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose.

We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing.

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around.

The cubs were playful and would chase each other's tails. I also saw odder badgers in our field. We built a sett for the badgers to move into. The cubs finally moved into their new home. Now, I see the cubs only occasionally, but they still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.

In the 17th century, Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass. These variations, known as declination, are the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.

Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various places, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland. From these travels, he published a chart that showed the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. His work was instrumental for seamen for more than a century.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate Halley's accomplishments by retracing his route. He has already spent two years in Antarctica and has a deep understanding of geomagnetism. Clark's expedition will involve making precise measurements of declination using advanced instruments. The data collected will help refine existing mathematical models of Earth's magnetic field.

Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has the necessary experience and skills to complete the journey, and he is also prepared to dedicate himself fully to the project.<eos>"

Peacocks that live in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks tail was not necessarily advantageous. Darwin felt that the tail was a waste of space and a severe encumbrance.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now trying to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

The study of peacocks at Whipsnade is providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of evolution. It is also helping to clarify Darwin's theories.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not significantly changed genetically. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities between humans and animals exist. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.

There are three main distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and not for survival or reproduction. Second, human art is learned rather than instinctive. Third, human art is transmitted by learning rather than by genes.

These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Volunteer tourism is a topic that is discussed by four academic writers. They argue that while volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, the actual contribution to development is often not as great as it seems. However, volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities. Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.<eos>"

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. One common way to wake up is the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available models.

We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. The wide snooze bar means you can tap it on the edge with your eyes shut. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing when I finally looked at the instruction booklet.

The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out in order to use a hairdryer or the vacuum cleaner. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.

The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'.<eos>"

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The effectiveness of this defence mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

To excel in any sport is difficult, even for men. Women have to be even tougher. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds, women are beating prejudice and breaking records.

Here, we talk to just a few brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, a skier, says, ""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. You just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice.""

B. Caroline, a cyclist, says, ""I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I'm because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money.""

C. Annabel, a rower, says, ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level.""

D. Ffyona, a long-distance walker, says, ""I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record!""

E. Lisa, a saloon car racer, says, ""Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!""

F. Alison, a triathlete, says, ""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes!""<eos>"

The day I met Picasso, I was an 18-year-old student travelling around Europe and Morocco. I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront and spent much of my time drawing. One day, I met Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was seated with his wife and three companions. I was nervous, but I managed to introduce myself and offer my sketchbook. Picasso agreed to sign my sketchbook and added an exuberant linear flourish. I was delighted and thanked him. We talked for a while, and I showed him my drawing. Picasso was impressed and gave me a nod. He also asked me to draw him, and I was able to produce a drawing that he admired. I was grateful for the opportunity to meet and interact with Picasso.<eos>"

They often place their fruit and veg at the entrance of the store. They also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around the store.

The author found that Robin was a natural sailor and that he enjoyed tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. The author also found that Robin was a kind-hearted person.

The author felt that they were very close on the yacht, but they didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. They found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a sensitive person.<eos>"

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. The camp is located ten miles south of the equator and is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and train hard every day. Their daily regime includes three work-outs: a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon.

When the day's running is over, the athletes have a simple life. They eat a basic diet, drink plenty of tea, and bathe in the streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers. By the time the runner leaves the camp, he is even more appreciative of Kenyan success.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is not effective because it is not targeted. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. However, advertising can be cost-effective. If an advertiser can target the right audience, they can be successful.<eos>"

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. There is a monastic stillness in the house. The Vales designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. They also designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and inexpensive to run.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been making weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but they are still admired for their artistry.

There has been a recent revival in blacksmithing. This is due to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.

No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good.<eos>"

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense'. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business. But when it comes to locating water, she needs nothing more than a forked hazel stick. The couple's success rate is higher than 90 per cent.

Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. After that, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the stick rises up. If she disagrees with her husband about the exact spot to drill, they won't drill and will keep looking until they agree.

Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere.

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again.

C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. It was a busy day with lots of work. I attended a staff meeting, helped with athletics trials, and did a nature project. The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking.

D. Hilary's story I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies. The process of milking the cows took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year.<eos>"

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career.

Hardenberger has a gift of finding the right compromise and making that relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre.

Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. He is a thoughtful and humble musician who is passionate about his work.<eos>"

Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.

A good leader is one who inspires, motivates, and encourages others. To be a good leader, you need to be able to speak out clearly and with conviction, and be able to make things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are.

You also need to be able to recognise your own potential for leadership and develop your skills. If you are a natural transactor, try being the negotiator. If you always ask for the views of others, try taking the lead.

Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes. To be a successful leader, you need to be able to delegate and motivate, organise and chastise, praise and raise.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects for photography. Photographs with people in them are usually more compelling than pictures without them. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take good pictures of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures, and expressions. You also need to be mindful of the presence of the camera.

There are a few things you can do to improve your pictures of people. First, avoid straight lines in group shots. Second, help your subject relax and find a comfortable position. Third, make sure that the subject is not overwhelmed by the background. Fourth, ask your subject to look into the lens. Fifth, use expressions and gestures to add interest to your pictures. Sixth, consider the situation and use it to your advantage. Seventh, take pictures of people interacting with each other. Finally, remember that pictures of people are often taken on holiday or during an outing. To show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building (or mountain, or lake) in the frame.

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received the most attention.

Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become sick.

Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also used to treat other conditions, such as nausea, vomiting, and indigestion.

If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.

Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether a person is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other serious problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

He was sick with bronchitis and couldn't concentrate. His wife, Molly, tried to persuade him to go to the doctor, but he refused. The storm had changed the appearance of Pelham's living-room. The walnut tree that had been a prominent feature in the room was gone. The room seemed cruelly bright and the worn furnishings were exposed. The tall house next door was now dominating the outlook.

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But the snow and wind were not the biggest threat to us. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder and the dam was filling up quickly. One day, the dam overflowed and the river surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild and dangerous. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy the huge clouds that hang over the valley and be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection, we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.<eos>"

Film Critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. That was how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lacking in self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of his reviews appeared, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but it didn't work out as planned. Mark chose film as his area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, they would hardly have come up with the present arrangement. The space he is given allows him to broaden his argument or forces him, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing.<eos>"

However, if you enter this world, remember one thing: you must fall in love with an object before you collect it. People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. Others collect flowers, paintings or pottery. If you are interested in collecting, there are many things you can collect. You do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. You can collect items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. As small objects become a popular collector's item, so they begin to rise in price.<eos>"

In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, Mrs. Malseed sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.

In the morning, we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and also made a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable and spread it to Europe. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented and the age of the chocolate bar began. Today, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week.<eos>"

Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, have travelled from Canada to Africa to find gold. They believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they are convinced that they are close to a five million dollar vein of gold.

The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. Since they started digging, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.

Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000 into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.

The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens.<eos>"

I was tired, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't take any more punishment. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year and the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe.

I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognise this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately.<eos>"

The baggage system can fail for many reasons, including extra security checks, air traffic problems, human error, and accidents.

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main subject of Susan's paintings?
2. What is the main problem with some of the plants in the garden?
3. What does Susan prefer to focus on when she is painting flowers?
4. What is the meaning of the word ""unruly"" as used in the text?
5. What is the significance of the flower borders in the garden?

On the rails, five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.

Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.

Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. The journey itself was lovely and the dress she wore on the train was a gift from her husband.

Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. The train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes he had ever seen.

Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life.<eos>"

If you want to get your story published, you need to do some research and practice your writing skills. To be successful, you need to know the markets you are aiming at and what publishers are looking for. You can find out about this by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.

Once you have done your research, you need to start writing. Write as much as you can and improve your writing skills with each story you write. Don't be afraid to get feedback from other writers or teachers, but don't show your work to anyone else in the early stages. If you have the time and resources, consider taking a creative writing course or joining a local writers' group. With hard work and dedication, you can achieve your dream of becoming a published writer.<eos>"

I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for my train to Philadelphia. There were a lot of people waiting. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples with matching luggage and swarms of college kids. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. I understood why he didn't. He was probably busy. He was looking seriously stressed. He asked a woman to help him. She was older than me. She agreed to help him. The man was holding a packet.

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. If you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

She went to the flat and met a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf. The girl was coming down the stairs and said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent.

Jo was amazed by the girl's appearance and her attitude. She had seen some of those girls on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.

Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.

Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.<eos>"

Getting fit is essential for your mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It improves the condition of your heart and lungs and blood circulation. It also helps to ease depression and tiredness, and regulate sleep patterns. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. The best exercise, therefore, involves a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout and definitely a cool down period.<eos>"

Mary Pearce was a student who worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job because of her wardrobe and the Head Teacher's comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?'

Many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked as an administrative assistant and was not given an interview because she didn't fit the office manager's image.

Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences.<eos>"

Young shoppers at the supermarket often make a lot of demands. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar-coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often struggle to deal with their children's demands when shopping. They feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. And they get cross and defensive in anticipation as they leave home.

Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. A lot of money is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate.

Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. They refuse to buy their children the sweets they want on the grounds that it's bad for them while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves.

Ice skating has a long history. People have been skating for thousands of years. In the past, people used skates made from animal bone. Nowadays, skating is both graceful and physically demanding. To skate, you need to be relaxed and have good balance and control. You also need to know how to fall safely. If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. There are different styles of skating, but the basic figures can be learned with proper guidance. Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation and movement. It also improves heart and lung activity and generally strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness.<eos>"

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to let people look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.

The drawings are an important part of French history and should be preserved for future generations. If we do not take steps to protect them, they will be lost forever.<eos>"

Going up the wall was once a challenging climb that could only be done in the mountains. Now, a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, climbers used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many of these early walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education who, during the mid-1960s, constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University.

Acting is all about making contact with the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted.

The game is played on a wooden board with 12 pieces called pucks. The goal is to flick the pucks into a hole on the board. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses have made a lot of money from selling pichenotte boards. They have sold more than 450 boards and they make $595 for each board. They have also started a business and they are making a living from the game.

The Lagasses are happy to share their love of pichenotte with others. They have made a website where people can buy their boards. They also travel to craft fairs and markets to sell their boards.<eos>"

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. These pictures often damage individuals in the public eye when they see their most private moments captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do pictures of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. However, there are also some problems with this idea. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?<eos>"

The lessons are popular, and there is a waiting list of children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee for the course, which is PS280. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''

But the note itself is just a piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted.

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her parents that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a loan and begin her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over PS500,000.

It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. You need spikes for your boots because the snow is very hard. There was a general feeling of nervousness when they set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The track soon climbed and their legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, Keith had to rest more frequently. After seven hours of climbing, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. Keith was glad they had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when he was safe in the tent that he could say he really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

Anna's new school is a very exciting place. It's made of wood, just like her old school, but it's also one of the first schools in her country designed to be environmentally friendly. The school took months to build, so they saw it all happening. There are five classrooms, a nursery, a dining room, and changing rooms. The school is well designed to hold all the heat and sound inside, so if they sing inside their classrooms, they can almost believe they're inside a concert hall. There's also a tree on the roof of the school. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. It's so big, it can be seen for miles. We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it. The replacement will be ready by next year, though.

We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have very good eyesight and can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, unlike other fish, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous.

The ice hotel is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season. As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed.

If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in.<eos>"

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, one or two directors had some original new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed, mainly because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main point of the text?
2. What is the main reason for the failure of The Black Cauldron?

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey.

The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very rare.

San Francisco is a city in northern California, USA. It is located on the coast. The first Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Although San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the miners who got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

When I injured my back, I had to take a break from running. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I started a running group for women in my area because I was annoyed by the lack of women in the sport and the lack of separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. They ran for only a minute at first, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress.<eos>"

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the winter months, there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built. It was used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.

As many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food.

Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''

Winter driving is dangerous because it's difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents happen easily. Fog can be waiting for you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly, pay attention to what might happen and allow extra stopping distance. If you drive smoothly, you can avoid spilling your hot coffee. If you pay attention to what might happen, you can avoid accidents. And if you allow extra stopping distance, you can avoid hitting the brakes too hard and losing control of your car.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main cause of winter driving being dangerous?
2. What is the first rule for driving on icy roads?
3. What is the second rule for driving on icy roads?

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art and became interested in early Italian artists. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked his parents for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, his parents were not sure about the idea because of the noise. But Ben argued that it was better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, his parents gave in. They said, ""All right, but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.""

Because drums are not easy to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at Ben's house with their guitars and other electrical equipment. And so, for several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.

Ben's hobby has been good for his health. Whenever the band start practising, his parents go out for a long walk. And although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men.

Their main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet. The parents are always stressing to Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.<eos>"

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It gives young people the opportunity to study for their exams and gain experience of life outside the classroom. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.<eos>"

In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!' When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television.

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When the weather gets colder, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are very cold in Canada, and the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters and socks with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters.

At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present.

Most house burglaries happen between the afternoon and evening, say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also call the police if you see anything strange.<eos>"

The history of farming. Before people started farming, they had to go to the forest to find food. They moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.<eos>"

It's very different from the life I have in the United States when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was good because I didn't have to pay any bills. Everyone was kind to me and it was fun.

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dog. The two smaller sizes first came to England many years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer has not been here very long. The name Giant is a good one because the dogs are tall. All the dogs have long hair, which should be cut quite often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey in colour, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use the dogs to help them with their sheep, and they are also used by the police, because Schnauzer dogs are very intelligent. A Schnauzer makes a nice family dog. It is friendly and very good with young children.

The Ruwenzori Mountains are a range of mountains in Africa. Mary Daniels is a student in England. This year she had a very interesting summer holiday. She travelled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns. 'It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where we could buy food,' said Mary. 'It was also very cold and wet in the mountains. It is one of the wettest places in the world.' Mary stayed in the mountains for six weeks. It was hard work, but she says it was the best thing she has ever done.

Dear Keira,

Thank you for your letter. I had my first day at my new school today. A girl called Nicole looked after me and showed me where the classrooms were. She is very nice and I am going to visit her this weekend. My favourite lesson today was Maths and I was happy because I knew more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time. I really enjoyed it. Most of the teachers seem friendly but I'm afraid of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot. I must go now because I have to do my homework. Hester.

Howard Bonnier is a young Englishman who lives in a village called Bray, which is about fifty kilometres west of London. He has a restaurant called The Palace. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his family. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.<eos>"

They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men.

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding at 20. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her when she was at a snowboarding competition last week in Switzerland and asked her why she started the sport. 'I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.'

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. 'Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.'

We asked her what is important when you're learning. 'You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!''

Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so suddenly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for the otters. But today there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe.

Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit.
