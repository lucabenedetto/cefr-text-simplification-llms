Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel unappreciated and undervalued in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, both verbally and non-verbally. You also need to be able to work well with others and be willing to learn from them. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to thrive in the workplace.
In addition to the above, there are a few other things that are important for success in the workplace. You need to be able to manage your time effectively, be organized, and be able to work independently. You also need to be able to adapt to change and be willing to learn new things. If you are able to do all of these things, you will be well-positioned to succeed in the workplace."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television."

Sometimes it seems that no matter how many possessions you have, you never feel secure. Having a basic nesting instinct and creating a home that meets your needs is reasonable, but there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising plays a big role in this. It is designed to make us feel insecure and encourage us to buy things. We are constantly being bombarded by advertising messages through various channels. Caves are also a fascinating subject of study. They are mysterious and arouse our curiosity. Researchers have invested a lot of time studying caves. However, cave research is not easy. It requires physical agility and can be challenging for learned professors. Amateur cave enthusiasts also play an important role in cave research. Meteorology is another fascinating subject. It is the study of the atmosphere. Countless people have contributed to meteorology by making observations. Satellites and electronic instruments provide us with a lot of weather information. Computers can solve complex mathematical problems quickly. Meteorological theory is complex and uses long words. But human experience is still the most important factor in weather forecasting.

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first in opera. The music is the foundation of the performance, and it is what makes the event truly captivating.
In the theatre, the word and the actor speaking it have primacy. There is no one directing the action once the event begins, and the performer and audience speak the same language. In contrast, music audiences often interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a particularly virtuos piece.
Despite these differences, there are some similarities between music and theatre audiences. Many people who attend music performances also enjoy watching plays. And, just like theatre audiences, music audiences can be passionate, expressive, and willing to contribute directly to the performance.
I believe that music and theatre can learn from each other. For example, music could incorporate more of the theatricality that is found in theatre performances. And, theatre could incorporate more of the musicality that is found in music performances. By working together, music and theatre could create an even more captivating and enjoyable experience for audiences."

Sand is a nuisance that can be annoying and difficult to get rid of. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you when you are wet. But it also disappears when you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car, or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet. Sand can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.
A lock and key are a symbol of security. They have been used for many years to keep people out of places. There are different types of locks and keys, but they all work the same way. If you have a lock and key, you can be sure that nobody will be able to get into your house.
Modern art is a difficult subject to understand. But if you are willing to learn about it, you can enjoy it. The new Tate Modern gallery has a lot of information about modern art. You can learn about the different types of art and what they mean. You can also learn about the artists who created the art.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.
The film studios were a complex and confusing place. They lacked a focus and were difficult to navigate. But they also provided a place where people could come together and share their dreams.
Film-makers are passionate about their craft. They want to make movies and share their stories with the world. If ever dreams came true, they did for Rodriguez - and ahead of schedule.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. I remember her as a lonely person who was always angry. She was also very possessive of her belongings. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked.
Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city."

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was thick. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses down the street, and I remembered them all. The houses had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The residents had divided up the open, shelved spaces in different ways. Some had turned their homes into stores, while others had reverted to being homes. I swam in the pool, and I nosed along, eyes just at water level. It was at the height of this drenching in the summer of 1996 that the notion of a long swim through Britain began to form itself.

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social function. It can help to develop the attachment between mother and child, and it can also promote trust and social connectedness. Tears can also be used to express sympathy, helplessness, and involuntary reactions. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues.

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.
Climate change is having a significant impact on the natural environment and humans. It is affecting the geographical locations of ecological systems, the mix of species they contain, and the availability of water. It is also causing changes to glacial processes and sea levels.
The consequences of climate change are potentially very severe. Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results. Huge numbers of people stand to lose their homes and livelihoods. This could produce many millions of environmental refugees."

If multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition, this will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel. Fuel efficiency is a priority. The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031. It's a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies. Given that these can be put in place soon enough, the spacecraft might just make it. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to achieve these ambitious goals will not be in vain, as they will lead to valuable advances for future missions."

Aesthetics is a field that studies the nature of beauty and art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. Additionally, the perfection of some artworks can lead to their isolation from human conditions and their general significance. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour."

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.
The production of effective advertising is difficult. There are a number of factors that make it even harder, including the economic situation, the changing needs and desires of consumers, and the increasing legal restrictions on advertising. It is not surprising that help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Reading a great book guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in major state occasions and provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal. It is also beneficial to the development of skills such as spatial reasoning, social relationships, concentration and focused study habits. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.
In the longer term, there are two possible scenarios. Firstly, the kinds of music to which people listen will become more diverse. Secondly, there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. These trends are likely to lead to an increase in the number of people, across the whole age range, who wish to actively participate in music making.
To prepare for the future, the focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. Ultimately, the instrumental curriculum and the measures used to assess progress through it will need to adapt to maintain their relevance for a broader sector of the population."

Blogging: Confessing to the world
Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing everything on the internet.
There are a lot of benefits to blogging, but there are also risks. If you put your personal information on the internet, people can use it against you. For example, if you write about your relationship on a blog, someone could read it and use it to try to hurt you.
In the early days of the internet, people started blogging as a way to share their lives. One of the first bloggers was Justin Hall. He started blogging in 1996 and he wrote about everything that happened in his life. He was very open and shared a lot of personal information. But his blog was taken down because people started making threats against him.

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture
The growing trend of historians to rely on oral evidence has its challenges. It is difficult to determine whether someone's testimony accurately reflects the past. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Students who come to study a social science for the first time must familiarize themselves with the substance and methodology of the subject. Each discipline of the social sciences focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses particular methods of study.

Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to grant this. On the road Lily had actually overtaken a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve and such timing that Mui had pressed her lips closely together against her own protest.
The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances. Taken aback, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the two sisters to look at the grey barbarian sea. He perched Son on the top railing and put his arms around his stomach.
Chen resolved to bring Son up his way. He would have an education in figures (Chen's own weak point) and grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience in all aspects of the trade on the way. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career."

I had read somewhere that from a deep hole, one could see the stars. I had persuaded you to help me with my plan. I climbed down the well and plunged into the water. I cracked my head and fell into the well. I was scared and relieved. I saw lights and stars. I was angry at you for letting me fall. I called out for help, but nobody heard me. I lay still, waiting for help. Finally, I was pulled out of the well. I was embarrassed and ashamed. I ran away and hid in the shadows. My mother and father came to see me. They were worried about me. I felt sorry for myself. I knew I had done something wrong. I apologized to my parents. I was punished. I was grounded for a month. I was not allowed to go out with my friends. I was very sad. I felt like I had been punished for nothing.

The Internet has opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits is that it has made book reviews accessible to everyone. Anyone can visit Amazon.com, the largest online bookstore, and read or write reviews. The egalitarian approach to book reviews on Amazon allows anyone to say what they like about anything and award it up to five stars. However, there are some concerns about the potential for abuse and misinformation. For example, there have been instances of writers giving their own books glowing reviews or submitting fake reviews. Despite these issues, the vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com are serious and provide a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods is worth buying."

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. Today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive.
There is a new trend in art today. Artists are choosing to paint pictures of the world of the London Underground. This is a popular trend because it is safe and easy to sell. However, there are a few artists who are breaking the mold and getting away with it. Picasso and Hockney are two prime examples.
My new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made my name for paintings of the world of the London Underground. I am not trying to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination. Otherwise why should we hurt one another?"

My father collected me and my trunk from my posh girls' school. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, in which I was presented with the Latin prize and the prize for the girl who had done best in her end-of-school exams. My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. He told me that I had the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision. He also said that I could go on helping him out in holidays until I leave Oxford, and then if I decide to leave him, I could have a bit of pocket money.
I agreed to do the assignment. I knew that if I kept my head and spent these last precious days carefully arranging information in my mind, he might well be right. I felt poised, confident, concentrated. This was not to be.

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.
The house wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The overcrowded tube journey had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, and the smell of dinner from the kitchen.
The job was important to Lois and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia."

I chose this place to live, hoping to find anonymity. But people in the shops soon start to recognise me. The roses in my garden were loved once, but they are gone now. I usually stay inside trying to forget that there is a summer going on out there, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying in the sky. I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.
My upstairs neighbour, Jaz, is leaning out of the window. She is a writer and I am sometimes called upon to dissemble about her unpublished manuscripts.

She is excited and wants to know if I will feed the cats. I say yes, and she is happy.

Heritage gives people and communities a sense of connection with the past. It is a fundamental desire for continuity and assurance about the future. It affects everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link with the past was through stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But, because Western industrial society broke up communities and families, much of that oral tradition has already been lost. Instead, places and architectural 'memories' give us clues to our past. It is vitally important to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.
Museums make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed - were used - had meaning - at some historical time. Museums which rise to the challenge and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.
Architecture and Environment
The desire to preserve things is not new. Change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it. Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it. Physical change, in other words, change in the environment provided by our towns, reflects social change - change in our numbers, in our welfare and in our demands."

Albert Einstein was a famous scientist who developed some mysterious theories about space and time. His theories are famous for being difficult to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday experience. Einstein's theories helped to change the way people thought about the universe. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature. Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy.
Young Readers Throughout our childhoods, Lydia and I distrusted any prize-winning book because we knew it would be boring. Our father would often give us money to read books, and he would sometimes put a book in amongst our Christmas and birthday presents. Though we dismissed most of his offerings as 'boys' books', he did, in this way, expose us to some shorter works of decent fiction and, just once, to a well-known anthology of verse.
Language probably developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. In the main speech was used for friendly interaction, and was an important tool in power struggles. Information-swapping was probably not an important original role - contrary to the views of philosopher John Locke, who spoke of language as a 'great conduit' for conveying knowledge."

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the subject matter. They also need to know quite a bit about quite a number of things and be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy.
However, reviewing is not a primary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough."

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself. The third is slower than thought. This slower mode of thinking is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.

I have been welcomed warmly to a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very isolated place. There are a lot of people living there, mostly scientists, students, and weathermen. My school French is not very good, but I can just communicate. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

However, there has also been a loss of simplicity. Now one may have to travel a long distance to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago.

Writing and Reading
Dr Johnson believed that writing without effort is generally read without pleasure. Good writing comes hard. Looking back at his handwritten school essays, the author was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today, he would have rewritten them five times over. The reason was that they were physically hard to write. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. What was difficult to alter or erase was written with care.
The author also discussed the difference between books and electronic text. He argued that reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most people never do it. What is new is not so much the branchings of electronic text as that computers don't invite the joined-up thinking of reading anything in its entirety.

It had the unmistakable dead ring of a lost conviction. He remembered tales of a famous author-about-town whose last book had been coaxed from him chapter by chapter, one payment at a time.

England's breakfast revolution. A good breakfast is important according to health experts. In historical terms, breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England. There are some references to travellers having a meal at dawn and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast. As individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours, often starting work extremely early, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for the ordinary traveller. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map, and also from place to place. In order to address the demands of the user, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions'."
