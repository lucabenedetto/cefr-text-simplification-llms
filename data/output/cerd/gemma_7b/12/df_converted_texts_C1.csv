Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel unappreciated and undervalued in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, both verbally and non-verbally. You also need to be able to work well with others and be willing to learn from them. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to thrive in the workplace.

In addition to the above, there are a few other things that are important for success in the workplace. You need to be able to manage your time effectively, be organized, and be able to work independently. You also need to be able to adapt to change and be willing to learn new things. If you are able to do all of these things, you will be well-positioned to succeed in the workplace.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television.<eos>"

Sometimes it seems that no matter how many possessions you have, you never feel secure. Having a basic nesting instinct and creating a home that meets your needs is reasonable, but there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising plays a big role in this. It is designed to make us feel insecure and encourage us to buy things. We are constantly being bombarded by advertising messages through various channels. Caves are also a fascinating subject of study. They are mysterious and arouse our curiosity. Researchers have invested a lot of time studying caves. However, cave research is not easy. It requires physical agility and can be challenging for learned professors. Amateur cave enthusiasts also play an important role in cave research. Meteorology is another fascinating subject. It is the study of the atmosphere. Countless people have contributed to meteorology by making observations. Satellites and electronic instruments provide us with a lot of weather information. Computers can solve complex mathematical problems quickly. Meteorological theory is complex and uses long words. But human experience is still the most important factor in weather forecasting.

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music comes first in opera. The music is the foundation of the performance, and it is what makes the event truly captivating.

In the theatre, the word and the actor speaking it have primacy. There is no one directing the action once the event begins, and the performer and audience speak the same language. In contrast, music audiences often interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a particularly virtuos piece.

Despite these differences, there are some similarities between music and theatre audiences. Many people who attend music performances also enjoy watching plays. And, just like theatre audiences, music audiences can be passionate, expressive, and willing to contribute directly to the performance.

I believe that music and theatre can learn from each other. For example, music could incorporate more of the theatricality that is found in theatre performances. And, theatre could incorporate more of the musicality that is found in music performances. By working together, music and theatre could create an even more captivating and enjoyable experience for audiences.<eos>"

Sand is a nuisance that can be annoying and difficult to get rid of. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you when you are wet. But it also disappears when you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car, or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet. Sand can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.

A lock and key are a symbol of security. They have been used for many years to keep people out of places. There are different types of locks and keys, but they all work the same way. If you have a lock and key, you can be sure that nobody will be able to get into your house.

Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.

The film studios were a complex and confusing place. They lacked a focus and were difficult to navigate. But they also provided a place where people could come together and share their dreams.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.

My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.

My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. I remember her as a lonely person who was always angry. She was also very possessive of her belongings. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked.

Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.<eos>"

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was thick. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses down the street, and I remembered them all. The houses had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The residents had divided up the open, shelved spaces in different ways. Some had turned their homes into stores, while others had reverted to being homes. I swam in the pool, and I nosed along, eyes just at water level.

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social function. It can help to develop the attachment between mother and child, and it can also promote trust and social connectedness. Tears can also be used to express sympathy, helplessness, and involuntary reactions. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues.

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

Climate change is having a significant impact on the natural environment and humans. It is affecting the geographical locations of ecological systems, the mix of species they contain, and the availability of water. It is also causing changes to glacial processes and sea levels.

The consequences of climate change are potentially very severe. Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results. Huge numbers of people stand to lose their homes and livelihoods. This could produce many millions of environmental refugees.<eos>"

If multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition, this will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel. Fuel efficiency is a priority. The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031. It's a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies.

Aesthetics is a field that studies the nature of beauty and art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. Additionally, the perfection of some artworks can lead to their isolation from human conditions and their general significance. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.<eos>"

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.

The production of effective advertising is difficult. There are a number of factors that make it even harder, including the economic situation, the changing needs and desires of consumers, and the increasing legal restrictions on advertising. It is not surprising that help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Reading a great book guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in major state occasions and provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal. It is also beneficial to the development of skills such as spatial reasoning, social relationships, concentration and focused study habits. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.

In the longer term, there are two possible scenarios. Firstly, the kinds of music to which people listen will become more diverse. Secondly, there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. These trends are likely to lead to an increase in the number of people, across the whole age range, who wish to actively participate in music making.

To prepare for the future, the focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. Ultimately, the instrumental curriculum and the measures used to assess progress through it will need to adapt to maintain their relevance for a broader sector of the population.<eos>"

Blogging: Confessing to the world

Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing everything on the internet.

There are a lot of benefits to blogging, but there are also risks. If you put your personal information on the internet, people can use it against you. For example, if you write about your relationship on a blog, someone could read it and use it to try to hurt you.

He started blogging in 1996 and he wrote about everything that happened in his life. He was very open and shared a lot of personal information.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Photography has had a major impact on society. It has been used to document events, promote social and political change, and provide a way for people to share their experiences. Photography has also made a major contribution to the development of the media culture that characterises our own era.<eos>"

Poetry writing is like walking through a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and careful, or you'll blow up. If you want to write poetry, you should read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination and spirit run free. You can write to a schedule, or wait for inspiration to strike. The most important thing is to find your own rhythm and voice.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters, long narratives, or rambling thoughts. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story. Dialogue is more effective than long explanations. Keep your writing concise and focused.

Screenplay writing is like playing chess. The more you practice, the more you learn. You need to be able to see the big picture and the patterns in the play. The more you play, the more aware you become of the complexities of the game.

Writing is a human instinct, but written language is not. It is a complex and challenging skill that requires practice and dedication. We need to understand how the minds of children work and how to help them learn to write.<eos>"

I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals. I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving. I have taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess.

Poetry recitals are happening all the time. There are different kinds of poetry being written and different ways of presenting and reciting poetry. Some poets write poems that are intended to be printed and read on the page, while others write poems that are meant to be performed to an audience. There are also different ways to promote poetry recitals. Some people hold small literary societies in their homes or community centers. Schools and colleges sometimes invite poets to read and talk to students. Arts festivals often have poetry readings by well-known authors. The consequences of all these events are manifold and of uncertain benefit to poets. If you want to learn more about poetry, you can attend a poetry reading. However, you should also read the poems on your own.<eos>"

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture

The growing trend of historians to rely on oral evidence has its challenges. It is difficult to determine whether someone's testimony accurately reflects the past. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.

Students who come to study a social science for the first time must familiarize themselves with the substance and methodology of the subject. Each discipline of the social sciences focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses particular methods of study.

Classical architecture was much more than the mere construction of buildings. It was an art form that emphasized aesthetics over function. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, in essence, the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.<eos>"

The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.

Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, had to grant this. On the road Lily had actually overtaken a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve and such timing that Mui had pressed her lips closely together against her own protest.

The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances. Taken aback, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the two sisters to look at the grey barbarian sea. He perched Son on the top railing and put his arms around his stomach.

Chen resolved to bring Son up his way. He would have an education in figures (Chen's own weak point) and grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience in all aspects of the trade on the way. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career.<eos>"

The Internet has opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits is that it has made book reviews accessible to everyone. Anyone can visit Amazon.com, the largest online bookstore, and read or write reviews. The egalitarian approach to book reviews on Amazon allows anyone to say what they like about anything and award it up to five stars. However, there are some concerns about the potential for abuse and misinformation. For example, there have been instances of writers giving their own books glowing reviews or submitting fake reviews. Despite these issues, the vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com are serious and provide a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods is worth buying.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. Today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive.

There is a new trend in art today. Artists are choosing to paint pictures of the world of the London Underground. This is a popular trend because it is safe and easy to sell. However, there are a few artists who are breaking the mold and getting away with it. Picasso and Hockney are two prime examples.

My new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made my name for paintings of the world of the London Underground. I am not trying to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination. Otherwise why should we hurt one another?<eos>"

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.

The house wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The overcrowded tube journey had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, and the smell of dinner from the kitchen.

The job was important to Lois and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.<eos>"

Heritage gives people and communities a sense of connection with the past. It is a fundamental desire for continuity and assurance about the future. It affects everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link with the past was through stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But, because Western industrial society broke up communities and families, much of that oral tradition has already been lost. Instead, places and architectural 'memories' give us clues to our past. It is vitally important to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

Museums make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed - were used - had meaning - at some historical time. Museums which rise to the challenge and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.

Architecture and Environment

The desire to preserve things is not new. Change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it. Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it. Physical change, in other words, change in the environment provided by our towns, reflects social change - change in our numbers, in our welfare and in our demands.<eos>"

Albert Einstein was a famous scientist who developed some mysterious theories about space and time. His theories are famous for being difficult to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday experience. Einstein's theories helped to change the way people thought about the universe. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature. Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself. The third is slower than thought. This slower mode of thinking is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.

Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. There were few charts and catalogues and telescopic equipment was limited. Today, there is a wide range of equipment available. Computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production. All this makes this the golden age of amateur astronomy.

However, there has also been a loss of simplicity. Now one may have to travel a long distance to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours. This makes solar observations impossible and hampers night-time observation too.

England's breakfast revolution. A good breakfast is important according to health experts. In historical terms, breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England. There are some references to travellers having a meal at dawn and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast. As individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours, often starting work extremely early, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for the ordinary traveller. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map, and also from place to place.

Painting and sculpture are natural subjects for the camera, but few series have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of looking at them. A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust. He has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored.

Dealing in Metals is a risky business. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago.

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. Each island has its own personality and something to offer. To get anywhere in the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. Sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that gems can be found. At night, it's the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay that sparkle.<eos>"

American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America has only just discovered him. Now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are in production and are expected to spring off the shells as fast as they are stacked. The American Museum of Natural History is mounting a grand exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is preparing a film based on Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as icon and exemplar. His sell-appointed apostles recount the details of his deeds with awe. They extract lessons in leadership and communications as parables for spin doctors.

Shackleton was a determined, resourceful man. He had a reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and a blubber-stove. He was a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. He was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose. He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh.

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. He led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard.<eos>"

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main difference between the way a woodpecker and the aye-aye find their prey?

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like? We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies, producing a hardback book of at least 20,000 words. The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms. Renier uses as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.<eos>"

I enjoy hard physical work and the rhythm of planting trees. The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts and ideas and reflections about life.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were fed every four hours and grew quickly. After a few weeks, they were weaned on to creamed rice and other foods. As they grew older, they started to dig for earthworms and other insects.

One evening, I spotted odder badgers in our field. They were probably extending their territories to find enough food. We were warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so sheet metal was placed over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.

We built a sett for the badgers on the farm. It had three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass side to enable people to see into the sett from a darkened enclosure. The badgers moved into their new home and are doing well.

In the 17th century, Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass. These variations, known as declination, are the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various locations, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland. From these travels, he published a chart that showed the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart was instrumental for seamen for more than a century.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate Halley's accomplishments by retracing his route. He has already spent two years in Antarctica and has a deep understanding of geomagnetism. Clark's expedition will involve making precise measurements of declination using advanced instruments. The data collected will help refine existing mathematical models of Earth's magnetic field.

Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has the necessary experience and skills to complete the journey, and he is also prepared to dedicate himself fully to the project.<eos>"

Peacocks that live in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. According to Darwin, the fittest individuals are the most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks' tail was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now trying to settle the matter of whether peacocks' trains are advantageous or not. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.<eos>"

The best boat design should combine old and new. Tom Cunliffe says that. He put it into practice in his own craft, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is showcasing fine yachts, bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. My boat, on the other hand, is quiet and peaceful. She was designed last year, but she looks like she could be 100 years old. Despite being an indispensable tool in current design methods and boat-building practice, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life. It's not that I'm suggesting that sailors should go back to enduring every hardship. But why go cruising at all if every sail sets and furls itself? The occasional battle with flapping canvas is surely part of a seaman's life. And for what purpose should we abandon common sense and move our steering positions from the security of the aft end to some vulnerable perch half-way to the bow? The completed boat has now crossed the North Atlantic and has won four out of her first six racing starts.

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not significantly changed genetically. As a result, the differences between humans and animals are mostly matters of degree. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. Monkeys also have a simple language.

Human art is unique because it is non-utilitarian, aesthetic, and learned. However, some similarities between human art and animal activities have been discovered. For example, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions and were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.

Three theories about sleep. People spend a third of their lives asleep. It seems certain that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. There seem to be three main theories. The most popular theory states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. A second theory emphasizes the learning benefits of sleep. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day, and asserts that, without sleep, learning would not take place. A third theory is based on ideas about energy, saying that we need periods of sleep in order to recharge our batteries and so have an adequate supply of energy for the coming day.

Someone who behaves abnormally or refuses to conform to the accepted norms of society is called eccentric. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity. The desire to be accepted and loved is stronger than the desire to stand out. People who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems. The most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness.

This money could potentially be donated to a local community directly, which could pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

There are also some potential benefits of volunteering, such as greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not be very beneficial for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities.<eos>"

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. One common way to wake up is the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available models.

The 'dual alarm function' that is advertised with this model does not allow you to be woken up by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends.

We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses and telephone.'

The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out in order to use a hairdryer or the vacuum cleaner. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.<eos>"

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The effectiveness of this defence mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

To excel in any sport is challenging, even for men. Women have to be even tougher. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds, women are breaking records and achieving their goals.

Here, we talk to just a few brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, a skier, says, ""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. You just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice.""

B. Caroline, a cyclist, says, ""I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I'm because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money.""

C. Annabel, a rower, says, ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level.""

D. Ffyona, a long-distance walker, says, ""I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record!""

E. Lisa, a saloon car racer, says, ""Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!""

F. Alison, a triathlete, says, ""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes!""<eos>"

The day I met Picasso, I was an 18-year-old student travelling around Europe and Morocco. I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront and spent much of my time drawing. One day, I met Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was seated with his wife and three companions. I was able to ask him for his signature and he generously agreed. I drew a portrait of Picasso and he gave me a copy of his signature. I was delighted to meet Picasso and I feel that I am very lucky to have had this experience.<eos>"

Talking shops are designed to make you spend money. They use a variety of techniques to entice you to buy more than you intended.

Some of the techniques that supermarkets use to entice shoppers include displaying fresh produce at the entrance of the store, providing an in-store bakery, and using special lighting to enhance certain foods. They also spread low-priced staples around the store and offer low prices on a large number of items.

Chainstores also use a variety of techniques to entice shoppers. They may display popular products far from the store entrance, use eye-level shelving, and offer special promotions. They also use lighting to create a more natural atmosphere and divide up their floors with different carpeting to guide shoppers along a specific route.

In-store promotions can also be used to entice shoppers. Giant photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses can be used to attract shoppers to the store. Video trolleys that advertise products as you shop can also be used to increase sales.<eos>"

Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are two climbers and sailors who have achieved great success. Bonnington is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. Knox-Johnston began his sea career in the Merchant Navy and was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handedly. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

One day, the author was working on a book about adventure and called Robin to ask for an interview. They went sailing and climbing together, and the author learned a lot from Robin about sailing and climbing. They also built a strong friendship.

The author found that sailing was trying and boring, but he enjoyed the moments of crisis and the camaraderie on the boat. He also found that taking responsibility for Robin's life was difficult. However, he knew that Robin was confident in him and that they would be able to complete the expedition successfully.<eos>"

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-meter runners, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. The camp is located ten miles south of the equator and is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and train hard every day. Their daily regime includes a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon.

When the day's running is over, the athletes have a simple life. They eat a basic diet, drink plenty of tea, and bathe in the streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers. By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. As brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are.

The average person buys very few advertised brands. Most of the items on their shopping bills are not advertised brands. Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Advertising is still cost-effective. It is a cheap means of mass communication. However, all waste is gruesome. With smart targeting the advertiser can minimise the wastage by increasing the percentage of readers or viewers who will respond; but he can never know precisely who will respond.<eos>"

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is full of surprises. It has a thirteenth-century chapter house and is designed to be energy-efficient. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off, there is a monastic stillness. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and maintain.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been responsible for providing weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but there has been a recent revival in interest in the craft.

The blacksmiths craft is unique because the metal is very soft when it is hot, but it becomes very rigid when it cools down. This makes it a challenging medium to work with, but it also allows blacksmiths to express themselves creatively.

There are many different types of blacksmithing work. Some blacksmiths specialize in making gates and balconies, while others make jewelry or sculptures. No other base metal can give man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security.<eos>"

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was furious. ""What do you mean?"" she raged. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I suppose my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours later was slightly irritating. The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. But I had low blood pressure and a long-living and healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and threw off colds more easily, it seemed to me, than friends with consciously healthier lifestyles. On that day, I had simply gone to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to give up. I could not have been more reasonable. After all, I positively enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me rather knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wished and most of the afternoon was conducted in a room so smoke-filled that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others. I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense. The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world? In many senses, it was easy. The physical craving, the pangs of desire for nicotine, faded after a minute or two. The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order. Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing - and it still is.<eos>"

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British woman scientist who won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1964 for her work on penicillin and vitamin B12. She was also a mother of three and wife to a historian. Hodgkin's life reflects some of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century, including the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.

There are a few challenges associated with writing a biography of a scientist. One challenge is that scientists often avoid personal appearances and interviews. Another challenge is that scientific ideas can be difficult to understand for many people. However, Hodgkin's biography is a well-written and engaging read that makes scientific ideas more accessible to the public.<eos>"

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense' that allows her to locate water. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business.

Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. Once she has identified the likely areas, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the stick rises up. If there is no water, the stick does not rise up.

Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? It would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and I wasn't sure I'd survive. Being a mother is definitely a busy job, but this was something else. I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed.

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down.

C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep in late. After that it was time for a maths class and a nature project. I was exhausted by lunchtime and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking.

D. Hilary's story I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.<eos>"

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He has a gift for finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo, Sweden. He owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing.

Hardenberger has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre. He bought all his records, and idolised him. His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career.

Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. He is a thoughtful and humble musician who is passionate about his work.<eos>"

A good leader inspires, motivates, and shows the way forward. Leadership is not about height or intelligence. It's about making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are. To convey enthusiasm and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak out articulately and with conviction.

Most people have a far greater potential for leadership than they realise. To become a leader, you need to recognise your latent talents, develop them, and use them. You can also benefit from improving your leadership skills, such as delegation, motivation, and communication.

Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. You have to set goals, then beat them. Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes.<eos>"

Films on video are a popular way to enjoy movies. There are many different types of films available on video, including action, comedy, drama, and horror. Some of the most popular films on video include A Abyss Long Before Titanic, The Thin Red Line, On Guard, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

These films are all very different from each other, but they all have one thing in common: they are all entertaining. A Abyss Long Before Titanic is a classic Cold War thriller, The Thin Red Line is a war film, On Guard is a swashbuckler, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a spaghetti western.

Each film has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. A Abyss Long Before Titanic has impressive production design and special effects, but the dialogue and characterisation are creaky. The Thin Red Line has a mystical and poetic approach, but the story itself is strictly B-movie material. On Guard has a lot of action and excitement, but the plot is thin. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has a great cast of actors, but the story is overly complex.

Overall, these films are all entertaining and enjoyable to watch. They are a great way to spend an evening.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects for photography. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take good pictures of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

To photograph people effectively, you should consider the following tips:

* Group people in a way that is visually appealing.
* Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
* Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
* Use eye contact or gestures to engage with the viewer.
* Show expressions and gestures that tell a story.
* Use the background to add interest and information about the subject.
* Photograph people in interaction with each other or their environment.
* Take pictures on the spur of the moment to capture genuine reactions.<eos>"

In the modern workplace, emotional intelligence (EQ) is becoming increasingly important. It is the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. EQ comprises basic elements such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.

More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a valuable component of management philosophy. The less straightforward the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If you have a high IQ but lack emotional intelligence skills, you may not be able to use your intelligence effectively.

There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world.<eos>"

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, including pain. Acupuncture is effective for treating chronic long-term pain, back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

Acupuncture can be used instead of anaesthesia during surgery. It is claimed that acupuncture anaesthesia involves none of the side-effects of conventional anaesthetics and you recover from it more quickly.

Clinical trials have shown that 50 to 80 per cent of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. However, it is important to note that acupuncture is not a cure for pain. It can help to reduce pain, but it does not eliminate it.<eos>"

She reveals that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is modelled after herself. Dalgliesh prefers to work alone, as does his creator. She also enjoys reading detective stories written by women authors. Success came to P.D. James late in life. She was born in Oxford and grew up mainly in Cambridge. She worked full-time in administration for the National Health Service and made good use of her organizational skills. She became 'quite accustomed' to seeing corpses while working in forensic science. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. It was the shape and construction involved in writing a crime novel that appealed. She says, 'Writing detective stories is a way of bringing order out of disorder.'

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.

Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether a person is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other serious problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them.<eos>"

Chewing gum culture is fashionable, classless, and popular in the United States. Americans chew 12 million sticks of gum a day. Gum is made from a natural substance called chicle, which is obtained from the sapodilla tree. The ancient Greeks and American colonists chewed gum-like resin. Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle. Today, the chewing gum market has grown, and manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands. Gum manufacturers say that chewing gum can reduce tooth decay. Research continues on new textures and flavours.

The hotel inspector Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. One day, she was inspecting the Globe Hotel. Things were not going well from the beginning. The receptionist was reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest, but she was not aware of the identity of the real guest. Sue was not impressed by the hotel's poor service and condition. She found out that the hotel was rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide. However, there were some problems with the hotel. The room was stuffy and had a gaping panel at the back of the wardrobe. The plumbing was also not working properly. Sue had to voice her complaints to the general manager, Robin Greaves. He was not happy, but he agreed to listen to her suggestions. After dinner, Greaves was feeling better. He was glad that Sue was not going to recommend that the Globe be stripped of its red stars.

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The river threatened us most. It was flowing wildly and was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. And then it happened - the reservoir overflowed. The river surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. It was like the Niagara Falls. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside. We can enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.<eos>"

He started his first proper job writing articles about films for The Front Page. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a good idea that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time. The space Mark has to write allows him to broaden his argument or forces him, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing.<eos>"

The Collectors

Amanda Roy writes about her passion for collecting and the reasons why people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. If you enter this world, remember one thing: you must fall in love with an object before you collect it. People have been collecting objects since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. Others collect flowers, pottery or paintings. There are many reasons why people collect objects. For some, it is the only aspect of their lives where they have complete control. For others, it's just something they enjoy doing. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a 'room of wonders'. Another aristocrat, Catherine the Great of Russia, collected more than 4,000 paintings. You do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. You can collect items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. As small objects become a popular collector's item, so they begin to rise in price.<eos>"

It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds bought the house and have added to it, but everything has been done discreetly.

Dekko picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good. He and Strafe were at school together, which must be why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to.

In the morning we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.<eos>"

Sarah's day begins early. She gets up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet. She has breakfast and prepares breakfast for the guests. After breakfast, she clears up and makes the afternoon tea. She then goes on the slopes and skis as much as possible.

In the evening, Sarah prepares dinner and takes a shower. She doesn't sleep. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. After dinner, she clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone.

On Sundays, Sarah has a busy day. She starts cleaning early and prepares tea for the new guests. Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. Between tea and dinner, she takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff.

You're not happy with your job, but you don't know how to change. If you're in this situation, you should consider talking to a careers adviser. They will help you write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and other similar tasks. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and he will produce a report giving his observations and recommendations.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are seeds from the cacao tree. The cacao tree is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate.

Chocolate is often eaten at Easter and Christmas. People also eat chocolate when they have a special occasion. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities.

Chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week. Manufacturers are looking for new ways to attract customers. The latest marketing trick is the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert.<eos>"

I was tired, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was glad to be home. I said exactly the same thing the following year and the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe.

I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring.<eos>"

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days, until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The system works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a specific time before departure. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are designed to allow for baggage transfers. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic can cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.<eos>"

The Netball Captain

Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is captain of England's netball team. She had a typical day for the weeks leading up to the World Championships. She taught at a local school and had a training session in the local supermarket car park.

Kendra is very focused when she is playing. She doesn't see anything else except her movements and her feet. She also points out that the World Championships are different because there's only one chance.

The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. There's no rest between games and you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.<eos>"

A child who shows outstanding musical ability may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. Specialist music schools in Britain provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen to develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend a significant amount of time on musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which concentrates on the essential subjects.

What are the disadvantages of attending a specialist music school? An obvious problem is the cost. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a very early age. Thirdly, there is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress. Finally, many musically gifted young people are also highly intelligent and feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Keeping the holiday-makers happy is a chalet girl's work. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is a chalet girl. She works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets.

Sarah's day begins early. She gets up at 7 a.m. and prepares breakfast for the guests. After breakfast, she clears up and prepares the afternoon tea. She then goes on the slopes and skis as much as possible. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone.

On Sundays, Sarah has a busy day. Work begins earlier than usual and she has to clean the place and prepare tea for the new guests. If she hasn't already done the week's shop, she does it now. After cleaning and preparing tea, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. Sometimes Sarah is so tired she just has an early night.<eos>"

On the rails, five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.

Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.

Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. The journey itself was lovely and the dress she wore on the train was a gift from her husband.

Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. The train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes he had ever seen.

Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life.<eos>"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting for the train in the Baltimore railway station. There were a lot more people waiting than I had expected. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. Elderly couples and college kids filled the benches and the floor. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. I understood why he didn't. He seemed unreliable. He swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. He was looking seriously stressed. He asked a woman to tell him if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes. He asked her to do him a favour. I stopped several feet away and frowned down at my left wrist. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet. It looked to be stapled shut. I said silently, ""Watch yourself, lady.""<eos>"

John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, a famous TV chef. Gary was given his chance to shine in the kitchen, and his father was proud of his success.

When John heard about an opportunity, he rushed to look at the place. It was in a really bad state, but it was perfect for what he had in mind. He dedicated himself to running the business and his wife took care of the children and the accounts. They lived over the restaurant and always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together.

Gary was a lively child and he loved to cook. He started working for pocket money and by the age of ten he was in the kitchen every weekend. He was disciplined and he always had loads of money at school. He was also very successful in his cooking career.

John is proud of his son and he believes that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. He also thinks that if you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten per cent of what you've told them, you've got to be happy with that.<eos>"

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was to know someone who knew someone who was leaving a place. If you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

The flat was upstairs and there was a cheerful-looking girl coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.'

Jo went on climbing and met a punk named Pauline. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to.

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.

Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.

Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.<eos>"

Getting fit is essential for mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It improves the condition of the heart and lungs and blood circulation. It also helps to ease depression and tiredness, and regulate sleep patterns. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe our appearance, including our clothing, eye contact, body language, and the speed and volume of our speech.

Mary Pearce was a student who worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job because the Head Teacher thought she didn't fit the image of an office manager.

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages, the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message.

Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. It is important to be well-informed about the company, have a few questions ready, and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences.<eos>"

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. This does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors lived on a diet based on a wide variety of sources. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people. However, the fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit.

The pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

Some visitors even chop off parts of the drawings to take home as souvenirs. Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings,or even their names, in the rocks. Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There also seems to be no prospect of government funding.<eos>"

Going up the wall was once a challenging climb that could only be done in the mountains. Now, a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, climbers used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many of these early walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education who, during the mid-1960s, constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University.

If you want to be an actor, it's a very risky career. There are a lot of actors, but there is not enough demand for them. If you choose to become an actor, many people will tell you that you're crazy. But it's a very personal choice, and only you can take responsibility for yourself and for realising your ambition.

There are no easy ways of becoming an actor. There are no written examinations to pass, and no absolute guarantee that you will be successful. It's all a matter of luck plus talent. Yet there is a demand for new faces and new talent, and there is always the prospect of excitement, glamour and the occasional rich reward.

If you ask actors how they have done well in the profession, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job, and that their fame may not continue.<eos>"

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. Today, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. This does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors lived on a diet based on a wide variety of sources. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people. However, the fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it?

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are playing a game called pichenotte. It's a game of skill that is popular in New Mexico, USA. The game is played on a wooden board with 12 pieces called pucks. The goal is to flick the puck into a hole on the board. You can score points by landing the puck in different rings around the hole. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses started making their own boards and selling them to others. They're made of birchwood and mahogany and weigh 12kg. They're available for $595 each from the brothers' website.

The game is popular and championships are being held. There's even a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. The Lagasses are happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune.<eos>"

The Model Village is a popular attraction that was built by one man, Colin Sims. It is a masterpiece that was created from a piece of wasteland. The village is made up of traditional British architectural forms.

The construction of the Model Village was a long and hard process. A lot of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the sculpted landscape you see today. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were also planted.

The Model Village is a very well-made and maintained attraction. It is a popular destination for people of all ages. You can enjoy the village by walking along the paths and pressing the buttons to make the models operate.

We ask you to keep to the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.<eos>"

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when their private moments are captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? The pictures of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony did not protect public health and safety. The actress had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should look into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. If the PCC decided to take on the role of 'police officer', there would be several problems. How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless?<eos>"

Confident people may appear to have a natural ability to be confident, but most people will tell you that it's a skill that can be learned. Nina Hathway asked five people how they did it.

A Jenny, a young woman, was shy and thought she would always stay that way. However, she surprised herself by doing well at school and was encouraged to do a university course.

B Michaela had to take over the family business when her father became ill. She was scared and became aggressive and impatient. But she learned that to be confident, you have to believe in yourself and be patient.

C Lisa, a TV presenter, has a calmer appearance, but she's actually very terrified. She has developed the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV.

D Barbara, a restaurant worker, has a natural confidence that comes from enjoying her work. She believes that if you just get on with it and learn from your mistakes, you're more confident the next time round.

E Kim, a former secretary, was afraid to speak up in meetings. However, she eventually found the confidence to start making her point. She also found it helpful to jot down a few things to refer to.<eos>"

For one group of children, aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are a time for learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

But the note itself is only a printed piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things like food or clothes. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency. '

After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria where she began teaching mathematics. She soon became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We have no copies of her books, but we know that she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work.

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her parents that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a loan and begin her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her.

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the north to the south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The climate can be bitterly cold because of its northerly location. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred meters up - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. The track soon climbed and their legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, Keith had to rest more frequently. After seven hours of climbing, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. Keith was glad they had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when he was safe in the tent that he could say he really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

The school took months to build, so we saw it all happening. There are five classrooms in the school, which are enormous. We share one room with people in the town when they want to have meetings and so on. There's also a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. The school is well designed to hold all the heat and sound inside, so if we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we're inside a concert hall. The roof of the school has a tree on top of it. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it. The replacement will be ready by next year, though.

My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not very comfortable, but we had everything we needed. On Saturday morning, I met the other ten members of our group. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we'd done.

When I realised what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do. I was 72 years old, I was a long way from home, and I was quite worried. I stood by the side of the road and just cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would just like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty. Mrs. B. James, Newport.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have excellent eyesight and can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. I was nervous at my first ballet class because I didn't know anyone. Everyone was talking in Russian, but I managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me and my Russian has improved enormously. The classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. I feel confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous.

The ice hotel is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season. As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed.

If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in.<eos>"

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. There were lots of people who rushed to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for PS45 and a bed for PS30. The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and refused to queue quietly. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What was really unbelievable was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. One customer, Jenny Smith, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.'<eos>"

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, one or two directors had some original new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed, mainly because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

Since we began, I have learned a lot. Much of what I have learned will be found in this book. I believe that we, as a company, have something important to say about how to run a successful business without giving up what we really believe in. It's not a normal business book, nor is it just about my life. The message is that to succeed in business you have to be different. Business can be fun, a business can be run with love and it can do good. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. Now this book sends these ideas of mine out into the world, makes them public. I'd like to think there are no limits to our 'family', no limits to what can be done. I find that an exciting thought.

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. There are more than three hundred varieties of honey. The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Honey is also used in many skin and hair-care products.

Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes.

San Francisco is a city in northern California, USA. It is located on the coast. The first Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Although San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the miners who got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

As well as books, he liked music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and plenty of fun.

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.<eos>"

When I injured my back, I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I decided to start a running group for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but also use this as an excuse for not providing separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves.<eos>"

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

In the winter months, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail.

Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train.

There are a few passenger trains that run from Vancouver on the cross- continent railway. The ride is still a great adventure.

It was exciting to watch - but even better when my band played on stage. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half.

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Sometimes, the rain falls heavily and the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods. But, as many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is always welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.

For one group of children, aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are a time for learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Winter driving is dangerous because it's difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents happen easily. Fog can be waiting for you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hidden beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road.

To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen. If you make uneven movements, the car can become difficult to control. So, every time you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or increase your speed, you must be gentle and slow.

You should also allow extra space for stopping when the road is wet, snow, or ice. If you test how long it takes to stop by gently braking, you may find that you are driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

By following these rules, you can stay in control of your car and avoid trouble.<eos>"

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but went to art school instead. There he found the drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art and became interested in early Italian artists. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. We were hesitant at first because of the noise. But Ben argued that it was better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, we gave in. We said, 'All right,' but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.

Because drums are not easy to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their instruments. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their singing.

Although their music may sound a little strange, the band is friendly and polite. They play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities. But so far, this hasn't happened.<eos>"

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It gives young people the opportunity to study for their exams and gain experience of life outside the classroom. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.<eos>"

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he began work as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After he had driven it a long way, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T'. It was a cheap car. He was soon selling a lot of cars. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she went up the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!' When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present.

BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also call the police if you see anything strange.

The history of farming. Before people started farming, they would go to the forest to find plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were always moving to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and slowly their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years.

Most smaller Schnauzers are grey in colour, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black.

Thank you for your letter. I had my first day at my new school today. A girl called Nicole helped me and showed me where the classrooms were. She is very nice and I am going to visit her this weekend. My favourite lesson today was Maths and I was happy because I knew more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time. I really enjoyed it. Most of the teachers seem friendly but I'm afraid of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot. I must go now because I have to do my homework. Hester.<eos>"

The history of horse racing. Horse racing has been an important sport since the first history books were written. It started in Central Asia a long time ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. Races were long and between just two horses at first, but they became much shorter and had several horses running against each other at the beginning of the 18th century. Today, horse racing is watched by more people than any other sport in the USA, except baseball. It is also very popular in other parts of the world.

Howard Bonnier Bray is a beautiful village about fifty kilometres west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking.

In London in the 18th century, there were no policemen. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night. About 300 years ago, London was growing bigger and dirtier. There were so many thieves that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

**Questions:**

1. What does Bob Marvisch do at Lake Nipissing in winter?
2. What clothes do you need to wear when fishing on ice?

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding at 20. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her when she was at a snowboarding competition last week in Switzerland and asked her why she started the sport. 'I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.'

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. 'Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.'

People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees.

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for the otters. But today there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top.

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practises hard.

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

Dinosaurs were giant animals that lived long ago. No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.<eos>"

Dear Jeff, I'm having a good holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were all different here: red, yellow, purple. Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
