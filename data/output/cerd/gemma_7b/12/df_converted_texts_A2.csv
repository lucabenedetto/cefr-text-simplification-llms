Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be a source of stress and dissatisfaction. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be able to work well with others, and be able to adapt to change.

If you are not satisfied with your current job, there are a few things you can do. You can try to find a new job that better suits your interests and skills. You can also try to improve your current job by talking to your boss about your concerns. If you are able to make some changes to your job, you may be able to find more satisfaction and fulfillment.

In addition to finding a job that you enjoy, there are a few other things you can do to improve your overall well-being. You can exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and get enough sleep. You can also spend time with friends and family, and engage in activities that you enjoy. If you are able to make some positive changes to your lifestyle, you may be able to improve your mood and overall happiness.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can be very persuasive, and it can make you feel like you need things you don't have. To see how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.

Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years, and there is a lot of research about them. Caves are also important because they have a long history of study. However, exploring caves can be physically demanding, so cave research has been less in the hands of learned professors than other scientific fields.

Meteorology is the study of weather. It has been around for centuries, and it has become a very technical science. Satellites and electronic instruments provide us with a lot of weather information, and computers can solve complex math problems quickly. However, human experience is still the most important part of meteorology. It's the human observations that translate data into weather forecasts.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily theatre, while music comes first in an opera. Music is a powerful and expressive art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including listening to recordings, attending concerts, and performing. Theatre is also a powerful art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including watching plays, attending festivals, and participating in acting classes.

There are some similarities between music and theatre. For example, they both require skill and dedication. They also both have the ability to entertain and inspire people. However, there are also some differences between music and theatre. For example, music is more focused on sound, while theatre is more focused on acting and storytelling. Music is also more portable, while theatre is more confined to specific locations.

Overall, music and theatre are two complementary art forms that can enrich our lives in many ways. They can evoke a wide range of emotions, entertain us, and inspire us.<eos>"

Sand is a natural barrier that can be harmful. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects. When you are wet, sand adheres to you like 'stucco'. But, when you are dry, sand easily falls off. It can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting information. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.

In those days, there were many council houses in West Earlham. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was quite the most solitary person I have ever known. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked.

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the air was thick with a drizzle that made my walk feel sheltered. I knew this side of the street well. There were many houses down the street that I was familiar with. They had been as distinct to me as the little troughs in the cement that led rainwater out to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became smaller. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses that had once been homes had become stores, and the stores that had once been homes had become houses again. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?

I swam in the pool one day. The rain fell down and made the water sparkle. I nosed along, eyes just at water level. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. It was a beautiful day. I wanted to swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea. Swimming is a subversive activity. It allows us to regain a sense of what is old and wild.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Plants and animals are being affected by these changes, as well as water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

Some of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in glacial processes, and rising sea levels. The consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe, with many people losing their homes and livelihoods.

It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. We also need to develop new technologies to help us adapt to the changing climate.<eos>"

Aesthetics is a theory that deals with the understanding and insight of art. However, the existence of art products has become an obstacle to theory about them. This is because these products exist externally and physically, and they often become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.

In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.

The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events.<eos>"

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. In Britain, it meant that a lot of people lost their jobs and homes. Every single business in the country was affected. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, there has also been a rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The fact is that while this recession naturally caused potential clients to review, reconsider and often cut their budgets at the time, it also made them examine more closely than ever before the economics of advertising. And, generally, in the absence of concrete, convincing and quantitative evidence to the contrary, they had to conclude that the benefits of advertising might be questionable.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed thanks to capitalism. Fashion has a long history, and it has become more complex and significant as societies have developed and technology has improved.

Music has a significant impact on our lives. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is used in many different ways, including national events, individual activities, and education. It can also have a positive impact on our well-being. Playing an instrument can improve cognitive skills, social relationships, and concentration. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can help to develop transferable skills such as study habits and punctuality. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the long term, there is likely to be a shift in focus and an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. To prepare for the future, the music profession needs to change. This includes providing more opportunities for people to learn to play a range of instruments, training musicians to be able to motivate, inspire and teach learners of all ages, and raising the profile of music itself.<eos>"

The craft of acting can be seen as a form of expression that involves both imitation and evocation. Actors often find themselves compelled to talk about their craft in interviews, which can lead to disdain and contempt. However, there are some actors who have a more nuanced approach to the craft. One such actor is Adrian Lester, who has been praised for his ability to convey emotion and passion through his performance. Lester's portrayal of the character Horatio in Hamlet is a prime example of his talent. The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the audience can hear, see, and feel what's going on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are important. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage.<eos>"

Poetry writing is like playing a game. You need to be spontaneous and creative, but also be aware of the risks. If you want to write poetry, you should read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination and spirit flow. You can write to a schedule or wait for inspiration to strike. The most important thing is to find your own rhythm and voice.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or long narratives. Keep your story concise and focused. Use flashbacks sparingly and only if they are necessary. Dialogue is more effective than long explanations. Keep your writing simple and direct.

Screenplay writing is also like playing a game. The more you practice, the better you become. You need to be able to see the big picture and the patterns in the play. The more you play, the more aware you become of the complexities of the game.

Writing is a human instinct, but written language is not. It is a complex and challenging skill that requires practice and dedication. We need to understand how the contraption called writing works and how to get children to learn it.<eos>"

I have never started a book with more worry. If I call it a book, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a few stories to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals. I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I could fill the gaps in my story, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in my story. I have also made sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are happening all the time. There are different kinds of poetry being written and different ways of presenting poetry. Some poets write poems that are meant to be read on the page, while others write poems that are meant to be read aloud. There are also different ways to promote poetry recitals. Some people hold poetry readings in village halls or their homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to audiences of students. Arts festivals often advertise poetry readings by well-known authors on their programmes. The consequences of all these events are manifold and of uncertain benefit to poets. If you want to learn more about poetry, you can attend a poetry reading. However, you should also read the poems on the page.<eos>"

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture

These are four topics that are being discussed in this text. Each topic has its own unique set of challenges and considerations.

**Oral History:**

The main problem with relying on oral evidence is that it is not always accurate. People's memories can be contaminated by what they have learned from other sources, or they may be influenced by their own feelings and attitudes.

**Animal Science:**

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Each approach has its own set of challenges and considerations.

**Social Sciences:**

The main problem facing students who are studying a social science for the first time is that they must learn two things simultaneously - the substance of the subject and the methodology.

**Classical Architecture:**

Classical architecture is more than just the construction of buildings. It is an art form that emphasizes aesthetics over function.<eos>"

The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt. They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. They left early in the morning and returned by midday. Lily had driven impeccably. She parked in a small street off the sea front. The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career. There was a trail of smoke just before the horizon met the sea in a thin line. There was a ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. 'Do you see the ship, Son?' he asked softly. 'It is a special little ship for people like us, Son.'<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often criticize art for being too flashy or not traditional. We also expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

There is a new artist who is doing things differently. He chooses a piece of text and writes it on a canvas. He does not use any flashy or charming lettering. The finished product is a painting.

The artist's new show is about the London Underground. He has painted pictures of the tunnels and stations. The paintings are beautiful and expressive. They convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.<eos>"

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which was only afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The house was not suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both.

I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.

His flat had been waiting for him, and he was grateful that it was still intact. He had grown impatient with its inability to be transformed. There was a puddle of letters and a red eye of the answering machine that sometimes gathered by the door. He would often read or listen to music as the night deepened outside.

Ralph often looked forward to his three or four solitary evenings at home each week. He would crave isolation, but the relief of escape drained him and he would wait for some sense of selfhood to return.

There are some activities that take a long time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.<eos>"

My school French is not very good, but I can just communicate. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless. There is no problem for me in this, but there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days.<eos>"

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map and also from place to place. To understand early maps, it is essential to understand the particular convention employed.

Climate and weather are also important parts of our lives. They can affect our health, our ability to travel, and our ability to grow plants. Climate can be a powerful force on the character of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates can support the growth of tropical jungles, which are home to a wide variety of plants and animals.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can find insects by tapping the surface of the wood and listening for reverberations. When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

**Questions:**

1. What does the aye-aye use its incisor teeth to do?

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like? We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.<eos>"

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around.

The cubs were playful and would chase each other's tails. I also saw odder badgers in our field. We built a sett for the badgers to move into. The cubs finally moved into their new home. Now, I see the cubs only occasionally, but they still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.

In the past, there was a scientist named Sir Edmund Halley who lived in the 17th century. He is known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley was one of only two men in the land at that time who were paid to conduct scientific research. He set sail for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time. He traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and England. From these travels, Halley published a chart that showed the variations of the compass.

Dr. Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip. He plans to retrace the route of the Paramore and make measurements that Halley made. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.

Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England and he envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews.<eos>"

Peacocks that live in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. How in this competitive world, where nature is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. The peacocks tail, by contrast, was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance.

The wrangle is still unresolved, but 200 birds at Whipsnade offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

There is a final twist to this continuing story. Fisher's Runaway mechanism shows that if females choose males with slightly better tails than the rest, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes.

Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that most differences between humans and animals now appear to be only matters of degree. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.

There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity.

These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Three theories about sleep. People spend a third of their lives asleep. It seems certain that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. There seem to be three main theories. The most popular theory states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. A second theory emphasizes the learning benefits of sleep. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day, and asserts that, without sleep, learning would not take place. A third theory is based on ideas about energy, saying that we need periods of sleep in order to recharge our batteries and have an adequate supply of energy for the coming day.

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played on a board, but much of modern chess is played off the board. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire.<eos>"

Volunteer tourism is a topic that is discussed by four academic writers. They say that while volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, they usually have to pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. If the money that is paid by volunteers is donated to a local community directly, it could potentially pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

Volunteer tourism can also lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, widespread and democratic participation in global affairs, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities.<eos>"

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. So, we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available models.

The 'dual alarm function' does not allow you to be woken by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends.

The radio has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.

The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this one appealed to Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'.<eos>"

Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The number of spines a hedgehog has affects its ability to defend itself. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so.

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers like to buy fresh produce. They often place their fruit and veg at the entrance of the store. They also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around the store.

Supermarkets also use other techniques to attract shoppers. They may spread low-price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores. They may also offer special promotions and discounts.

If you're a shopper, you're probably aware of the importance of pricing. It's important to compare prices and see which items are the best value for your money. Supermarkets take advantage of this by stocking a mix of low mark-up staples and high mark-up items.

So, the next time you're shopping, take a look at the prices of the items in the store. You may be able to find some great bargains.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is not effective because it is not targeted. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. However, advertising can be cost-effective. If an advertiser can target the right audience, they can be successful.<eos>"

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is full of surprises. It has a beautiful ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, and it is also the greenest dwelling in Britain. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off, there is a monastic stillness. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and easy to maintain.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, he thought he was seeing scientific proof that fairies really existed. He published photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been making weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but they are still admired for their artistry.

There has been a recent revival in blacksmithing. This is due to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.

The exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is a popular event. It showcases a wide range of pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase. The prices for the pieces range from PS90 to four figures. Most of the money raised will go to individual makers, but a percentage of every sale will be retained by the Association for the promotion of good ironwork.<eos>"

I stopped smoking a few months ago. I was surprised that one of my colleagues was angry about it. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I guess I was unable to explain how I had been smoking a lot and how I had stopped. The stop-smoking session was interesting. It was a mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It took place a few months ago. I did not intend to stop and I did not particularly want to. But I did stop. I found that it was easy to stop smoking. The physical craving and the pangs of desire for nicotine faded after a few days. I had to address some new experiences as a non-smoker, such as eating out and waiting for a plane. But I am still coming to the view that smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom.<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere.

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could.

C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! The process of milking the cows took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year!

D. Hilary's story I found it quite a lonely day. The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off.<eos>"

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career.

Hardenberger has a gift of finding the right compromise and making that relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre.

Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. He is a thoughtful and humble musician who is passionate about his work.<eos>"

Films on video are a popular way to enjoy movies. There are many different types of films available on video, including action, comedy, drama, and horror. Some of the most popular films on video include A Abyss Long Before Titanic, The Thin Red Line, On Guard, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

These films are all very different from each other. A Abyss Long Before Titanic is a Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. The Thin Red Line is a war movie about the battle for Guadalcanal. On Guard is a swashbuckler movie about a group of musketeers. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a spaghetti western about the post-Civil War West.

Each film has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. A Abyss Long Before Titanic has impressive production design and special effects, but the dialogue and characterisation are creaky. The Thin Red Line has a mystical and poetic approach, but it lacks moments. On Guard has a lot of action and excitement, but the story is corny. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has excellent sound editing and Morricone's magnificent music, but the storytelling is relentless and cruel.

Newspapers are facing a decline in sales, but their websites are going ever higher. The latest print circulation figures show that sales are plummeting, but the websites of The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and many of the rest are up. The decline in sales is due to a number of factors, including timing, demography, geography and more. However, the latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. Books are also facing a decline in sales, but e-readers are booming.

People are the most interesting subjects for photographs. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take good pictures of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

To improve your pictures of people, you can follow these tips:

* Group people in different ways to create interest.
* Help people relax and pose naturally.
* Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
* Use eye contact or gestures to connect with the viewer.
* Show expressions and emotions through gestures and facial expressions.
* Use the background to add interest and information about the subject.
* Include interaction between people in your pictures.
* Take pictures of people in their environment to show where they were.
* Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting in your picture.
* Decide whether you want to pose or not pose the subject.<eos>"

In the workplace, emotional intelligence (EQ) is becoming increasingly important. It is the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. EQ comprises basic elements such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.

More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging EQ skills is a valuable component of management philosophy. If you have strong EQ skills, you are more likely to be successful in your job and in every part of the world.

There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, EQ is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job.<eos>"

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although it is easier to capture newsworthy events with digital cameras and camera phones, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that a significant number of people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most attention.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.

To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles inserted into the skin. They may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.

It is important to note that acupuncture is not a substitute for medical treatment. If you are experiencing pain, you should consult with a doctor to see if acupuncture might be right for you.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.

Handwriting can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form 'threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.

It takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately. To be able to use graphology effectively, you also need empathy and intuition. More research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing.<eos>"

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

I was in a snow cave below the summit when I started talking to my feet. The cold was getting into my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. We followed a new route and spent a lot of time on the ridge.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

We got lost in the dense jungles and ran out of water. We found a rock pool and spent the night there.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

We walked to the refuge and crossed open slopes. We reached what we thought was the summit, but there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a lot of ideas for the newspaper, but they didn't all work out. The general public preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area. Mark chose film as his subject area. He likes the space he has to broaden his argument. He doesn't feel he has a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. All he has to do is put forward an argument.<eos>"

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch. Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist when they're not in pain. To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. He has taken steps to make the surgery more relaxing, such as using virtual-reality headsets and playing videos. He also wants people to smell pleasant things when they walk into the surgery. The surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. The quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them.<eos>"

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and also made a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable and spread it to Europe. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented and the age of the chocolate bar began. Today, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week.<eos>"

I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel freely throughout Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not there, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days. Sometimes, the airline may not be able to find your luggage, and you may be forced to wear unsuitable clothes in a different climate zone.

The baggage system can fail for many reasons. Sometimes, there are extra security checks at airports or problems with air traffic. There can also be human error or an accident in which the destination label is torn off. These problems can become severe at large transfer airports. Last year, for example, London's Heathrow airport handled more than 41 million passengers, of whom nine million were changing planes.

If your luggage goes missing, you should contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.<eos>"

On the rails, five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.

Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.

Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. The journey itself was lovely and the dress she wore on the train was a gift from her husband.

Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. The train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes he had ever seen.

Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life.<eos>"

If you want to get your story published, you need to do some research and practice your writing skills. You should find out about publishers and markets, and read everything you can about the writing game. To be successful, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at and write well. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not likely to be published. If you want to become a successful writer, you need to write a lot and keep practicing. You should also join a local writers' group or take a creative writing course.<eos>"

I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot of people waiting. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples and college kids waiting. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. I understood why he didn't. He was probably busy. He was looking seriously stressed. He asked a woman to help him. She was older than me. She agreed to help him. The man was holding a packet. It looked like it was stapled shut. I warned the woman about the packet.<eos>"

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. If you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was a hostel in Dublin that Jo stayed in. It was run by nuns and it was warm. The flat was not in the basement, it was upstairs. And there was a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, coming down the stairs.

Nessa was a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf. She said they were just about to have a mug of tea. She produced three mugs; one had 'Nessa' and one had 'Pauline' and the other one had 'Other' written on it.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins also suffer from pollution and other substances found in the sea. One example is pesticides. These poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.

Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.<eos>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

A dive can last for 16 hours. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released. No-one has tested it yet, but it would be a very unpleasant journey.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two thirds of her salary comes from teaching. She loves teaching, but she does it so she can get on with her research.

The only time Rachel has been frightened is when she first went down with the Americans. There was an explosion and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" But she was still alive.

It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the underwater volcanoes, there is such a sense of wonder.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe our dress, eye contact, body movement, voice volume and tone, and words.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job. The Head Teacher said that someone who doesn't take the time to present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?

Many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked as an administrative assistant and was not given an interview because she didn't fit the image of an office manager.

Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview.<eos>"

Young shoppers at the supermarket often make a lot of demands. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often have a lot of trouble managing their children's shopping demands. They feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. And they get cross and defensive in anticipation as they leave home.

Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. A lot of money is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate.

Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. They refuse to buy their children the sweets they want on the grounds that it's bad for them while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves.

Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas.<eos>"

I have a lot of work to do, but I enjoy it all. I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even though you may be feeling tired. I need a fair bit of sleep so when I do get it, I feel really good. When I'm running at six hours' sleep a night, I feel a bit wet. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's finding the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and I try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've done exercise, my spirits rise amazingly.

I also get energy from being sociable and from making a garden. If I'm feeling low, I try to do something that makes me happy, such as taking photographs or writing words for imaginary songs.<eos>"

Ice skating has a long history. People have been skating for thousands of years. In the past, people used skates made from animal bone. Nowadays, skating is both graceful and physically demanding. To skate, you need to be relaxed and have good balance and control. You also need to know how to fall safely. If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. There are different styles of skating, but the basic figures can be learned with proper guidance. Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation and movement. It also improves heart and lung activity and generally strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness.<eos>"

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. But to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. When I left home to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to let people look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.

The drawings are an important part of history and must be preserved for future generations. If we do not take steps to protect them, they will be lost forever.<eos>"

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, pictures of individuals in the public eye are taken without their consent and published on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do pictures of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. However, there are also some concerns about taking on this role. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?<eos>"

He wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the enormous drops. He was glad that his car was still there. He went back to Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital. Everyone was friendly. Kelantan is best known for its kites, but Paul remembered it more for its human kindness.<eos>"

What sort of shopper are you? We all go shopping, but there are different types of shopper. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers. Some people are addicted to shopping, while others are reluctant or even hate it. There are also people who only shop for essentials or those who like to go for a look around.

If you are an addicted shopper, you might be like Abby. You can't spend enough money and you feel miserable when you don't have cash. If you are a reluctant shopper, you might be like Brenda. You don't spend much time shopping for clothes and you feel guilty when you spend money on yourself. If you are an essential shopper, you might be like Juliet. You only shop for essentials and you find shopping tiring. If you are a careful shopper, you might be like Suki. You like going to the shops, but you don't buy very much. If you are an unwilling shopper, you might be like Linda. You don't like shopping and you don't bother to try things on.<eos>"

For one group of children, Saturdays are a time to learn how to cook. Their lessons are popular and there is a waiting list of children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her parents that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a loan and begin her own womenswear label. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over PS500,000. Her clothes appear in fashion magazines, she designs for pop stars and she has just gained public recognition by winning this award.

From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days. They carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for their boots. The track was steep and there was a lot of snow. The weather was perfect, but there was still a general feeling of nervousness. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. After a long climb, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly.

Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These lines make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This technique is very useful for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. They were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. Each week after that, a new part of the hotel is completed until the hotel is finished. The finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Guests can wear warm clothes and socks inside the hotel, but they need to bring their own sweaters and scarves. If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the website. You can also order equipment and book your visit at the same time. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ice hotel.<eos>"

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. There were lots of people who rushed to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa and a bed. The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What was really unbelievable was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. One customer, Jenny Smith, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening.

New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people thought that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed. The main reason for its failure was that it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. There are more than three hundred varieties of honey. The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Honey is good for you. It prevents tiredness and improves athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products.

The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six, says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. It's the time when you are learning about the world. Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear.

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. In the winter, there was no way to get to the towns by boat or plane. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art and became interested in early Italian artists. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

But Ben argued that it was better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, we gave in. We said, 'All right,' but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.

Because drums are not easy to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.

One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries.

All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present. On the walls of Jenny's office, there are lots of letters from happy customers all over the world.

BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also call the police if you see anything strange.

**Questions:**

1. What time of day are most house burglaries happening?
2. What is the main cause of house burglaries?
3. Why are night-time burglaries unusual?
4. What is the best time for burglars?

The history of farming. Before people started farming, they had to go to the forest to find food. They moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

This is what she told us about her job: 'My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend most of my time in the air. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems. I also go to lots of meetings. My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses.

'Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.'<eos>"

In London in the 18th century, there were no policemen. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night. About 300 years ago, London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Today, London police are quite well paid.

**Questions:**

1. What was the situation in London in the 18th century?
2. What was the main problem in London in the 18th century?
3. What happened in 1750?

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

**Questions:**

1. Where is Lake Nipissing located?
2. What do fishermen build on the ice?
3. What do you need to wear when you go fishing?
4. How do you catch fish?
5. What do you prefer to have when you have caught fish?

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we went to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

""I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.""

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. ""Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We asked her what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!""<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are a few paths to the top. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was so dirty that many fish and insects died. But today there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top.

Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit.

Dinosaurs were very long ago. No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants.

The bear is a dangerous animal. It is very strong and can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and running very fast. But they cannot see well and, like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are different kinds of bear. The largest is the white polar bear, which is almost three metres tall. There are two kinds of black bear: One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown.

Dear Jeff, I'm having a good holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. Because the water was so warm, I loved swimming there. The fish were all different here: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home! See you at the end of September. Sue
