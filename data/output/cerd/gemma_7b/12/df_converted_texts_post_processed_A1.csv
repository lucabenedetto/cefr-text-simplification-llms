Garbage collection is a ritual that happens regularly in developed countries. In most places, it is free. But if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To solve this problem, we can charge households for the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
However, the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be able to work well with others, and be able to manage your time effectively. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to enjoy your work.
There are a number of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you are passionate about. Another is to make sure that you are able to use your skills and talents in your work. If you are not able to do this, you will not be able to be truly successful.
Another important factor is to have good relationships with your colleagues. If you have a good relationship with your colleagues, you will be more likely to be able to work effectively together and to be more satisfied with your work.
Finally, it is important to be able to manage your time effectively. If you are able to manage your time effectively, you will be able to get more done in less time and be more satisfied with your work."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.
The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television."

Sometimes it seems that no matter how much stuff you have, you don't feel secure. It is good to have a home that meets your needs, but there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising can be very persuasive. It can make you feel like you need things that you don't really need. To discover just how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.
Caves are interesting places. They are part of the natural environment and they have a long history of study. However, visiting caves can be physically demanding. It requires a lot of agility. Because of this, cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields.
Weather is a fascinating subject. Countless people have studied it for centuries. Today, we have advanced technology that can help us predict the weather. But human experience is still the most important part of weather forecasting. It is the human observations that can provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals."

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. The music in a musical performance is like watching an athletics match. The audience is not necessarily impressed by the actor's skill or the length of the speech. However, they are often awestruck by the skill of the performers. Music and theatre can both be very enjoyable. They bring people together and make them feel happy.

Sand is a natural barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects. When you are wet, sand adheres to you like 'stucco'. But, when you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, it pours off you. Sand stays with you for longer than many contagious diseases.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film usually involves reducing, condensing and deleting. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating.

In those days, there were many council houses in West Earlham. They were all very similar to each other. In the summer, the chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is one memory of sitting on a windowsill and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other memories. My mother was a very lonely person. She was always angry. I remember her saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as a solitary instance of my mother attempting to make a joke."

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also help us to express our emotions, such as sadness, anger, or happiness. Sometimes, we cry because we are helpless. And sometimes, we cry because we are moved by something that makes us feel sad or happy."

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather and the planet. The changes to climate will have a significant impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system and the effects of climate change. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.
Climate change has the potential to affect the geographical locations of ecological systems, food production, water resources and human settlements. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, and they are likely to become more severe in the future.
The most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe."

A middle-aged couple is wanted to join a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. If the plans of a multi-millionaire named Dennis Tito are successful, this will be the first Martian astronauts. The spacecraft will travel to about 160 kilometers above Mars. It will use the gravity of Mars to return to Earth without burning any fuel. The goal is to save fuel, as fuel efficiency is a priority. The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again is in 2031. It's a long time, but the race is on to develop new technologies. If the spacecraft is successful, it might just make it to Mars. Even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to achieve these ambitious goals will not be in vain, as they will lead to valuable advances for future missions.

Aesthetics is a theory about the beauty and meaning of art. However, the existence of art products can sometimes make it difficult to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art products exist physically and separately from human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This can make it difficult to understand the meaning of artistic products. Additionally, the perfection of some art products can create conventions that get in the way of fresh insight.
In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. For theory is concerned with understanding and insight."

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as the ones who spearhead efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, alongside these psychological and financial imperatives lies an almost paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there's some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people."

I was at university and I decided I wanted to be a chef. Cooking was not a popular job, but I was unhappy at university and I thought being a chef would be the perfect antidote to my problems. I started reading cookbooks and learning how to cook. I also started to develop my own aesthetic ideal. One day, I ate a meal at a famous restaurant and it was a revelation. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards. After that, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art.
I also learned to swim. I asked my instructor to teach me how to dive and he told me to sit on the pool's edge and put my hands above my head and roll forwards. I practised that manoeuvre until the hour was up. The next visit, he got me standing upright and diving off the edge. It was a lot of fun.

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed because of the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have grown more complex, people have started to wear more clothes and accessories. The meanings attached to dress have also become more complex and significant. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people. Some writers earn money by writing articles and books, while others earn money by teaching or doing other jobs. Some writers are lucky enough to get a job offer from a chocolate factory, but most writers have to find other ways to make ends meet.

Music has a significant impact on our lives. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal. It is also beneficial to our well-being. Playing an instrument can improve cognitive skills, social relationships and concentration. There is also a growing body of evidence that playing an instrument can have positive effects on learning and development. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.

The craft of acting is sometimes criticized. Actors often complain about being compelled to talk about their craft in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' Instead of giving a good answer, actors often fall into ponderous cliches, silly truisms or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine.

Photography has been used to record human life and activity for many years. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world and from distant parts of the solar system. It has been used to express the human condition and to document historical events.
Photography has also been used to promote social and political change and development. For example, photography has been used to document the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century and to bring about the media culture that characterises our own era.
However, photography also has its challenges. One challenge is that it can be difficult to capture the exact moment that you want. Another challenge is that photography can be biased. This means that it can be difficult to represent the truth accurately."

I have never started a book with more worry. If I call it a book, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I end neither with a death or a marriage.

I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in the story. I have also made sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose.

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture
There are some problems with using oral history as a source of information. It is not always accurate, and it can be affected by the presence of an outsider. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, while those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal.
If you are studying a social science for the first time, you will need to familiarise yourself with the substance and methodology of the subject. You will also need to become familiar with the basic ideas in the subject.
Classical architecture was much more than just the construction of buildings. It was an art form. The origins of classical architecture are complex, but there was a long prehistory of basic construction that contributed to the later sophisticated architectural concepts."

But when we get to the art of our own day, we sometimes feel that the artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.
The artist chooses a piece of text and writes it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. But if the artist wants to be successful, he must stick to one genre. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam.
I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side."

My father collected me and my trunk from my posh school. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, in which I was presented with prizes. My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. He said that I had the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision. He also said that I could go on helping him out in holidays until I leave Oxford. I agreed to do it.
I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I intended to wear when I took my final exams. In my last term, my father came up to see me and drove me out to a village for a meal and a chat. He asked me to do one last assignment for him, but I refused. I felt that such pressures were simply beyond my father's imagination. However, I eventually agreed to do it."

Simon Costello knew that buying the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession that was only affordable by exercising strict economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a lot of successful cases and they were coming in with regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.
The house wasn't really suitable for a family and they needed more room. All these things could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The overcrowded tube journey had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead and the smell of dinner from the kitchen.
The job was important to Lois and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia."

Heritage gives people a sense of connection to the past. It helps us understand and interpret our individual and national futures. It is also important for our well-being. Heritage can be found in many things, such as customs, material culture, stories, and places.
Museums are important for preserving heritage. They make collections accessible to the widest possible community. Museums exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed and had meaning at some historical time.
Architecture and environment are also important for preserving heritage. Change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. If there is a psychological need for preservation, it is part of the planners job to take account of it."

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the other things they need to know. They also need to be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy.
However, reviewing is not a full-time job. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough."

There are some activities that take a long time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
There are also other ways of knowing that are slower than thought. These ways are often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode, we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative.

I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

There are some references to people having breakfast in the middle of the night or before starting their journey. But most people did not have breakfast unless they were wealthy or royalty. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast became more common. This was because there was more food available.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The traveller's main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', so accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content."

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It can bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can find insects by tapping the surface of the wood and listening for reverberations. When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

In the past, there was a scientist named Sir Edmund Halley who lived in the 17th century. He was known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley was one of only two men in the land at that time who were paid to conduct scientific research. He set sail for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time. He traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and England. From these travels, Halley published a chart that showed the variations of the compass.
Dr. Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip.

There is also a final twist to this story. If a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail than the rest, her sons and daughters will inherit their father's tail and their mother's predilection for long tails. This is called 'Fisher's Runaway'."

The best boat design should combine old and new. Tom Cunliffe says that. He designed his own boat, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has a lot of new technology, but it also has some traditional features. It is a beautiful boat, and it is very seaworthy.
My own boat is not as big or as fancy as The Westerman, but it is still a good boat. It is made of wood, and it is very strong. I have owned my boat for many years, and I have never had any problems with it.
Boats need to be looked after, but they can also be very rewarding. If you are thinking about buying a boat, I would recommend that you do your research and find a boat that is right for you."

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.
Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities exist between humans and animals. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. Monkeys also have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.
There are some differences between human art and animal activities. Human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. But these differences don't seem to be fatal. Human art and ape paintings serve no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

The Taklamakan Desert is a very dangerous place in western China. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialize in them. Now you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life.
Charles Blackmore led an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The team was composed of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese, 30 camels and six camel handlers. The expedition was difficult and dangerous. They suffered from dysentery, extreme heat and thirst. But they managed to find water and complete their journey.
Blackmore felt proud of his accomplishment. He felt that he had achieved something special. He also felt grateful for his family and their support. He knew that he had found peace."

Three theories about sleep. People spend a third of their lives asleep. It seems certain that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are not in agreement about why we sleep so much. There seem to be three main theories. The most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for the health of our body. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. A second theory says that sleep is for learning. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day. A third theory says that sleep is for energy. This theory says that we need periods of sleep in order to have enough energy for the coming day.

Someone who behaves in a way that is different from others is called eccentric. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. It is like having two forces pushing against each other inside of us. One force is called individualism and the other force is conformity. Most of us tend to conform to the majority. We feel a need to be accepted and loved. If we do something that is different from what others expect, we may be seen as eccentric. However, if we do something that is natural and unique to us, we are not necessarily eccentric. The most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness."

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game is played on a board with 64 squares. Each player has 16 pieces, including a king, queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops and eight pawns. The game is played in turns, with each player making one move at a time. The winner is the player who captures the other player's king. The game can last up to eight hours. For the chess master, this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire."

Volunteer tourism is a topic that four academic writers discuss. It can be a positive or negative experience. On the one hand, it can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks. On the other hand, it can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development.
Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development. However, volunteer tourism can also be seen as a way to bypass the democratic imperative of representative government and reduce development to individual acts of charity.
The act of volunteer tourism may involve only simple, commendable charity. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development."

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. Most people also need some help to wake up. So, we have the clock radio. To pick a good one, you need to test five currently available models. The 'dual alarm function' does not allow you to be woken up by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. The inclusion of a cassette player is quite a bargain. You can fall asleep to your own soothing tapes and wake up to a day without news.
The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing. The light was certainly hard to position; you would never be able to read by it. The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'."

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The number of spines a hedgehog has affects its ability to defend itself. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines and are more likely to run into their attacker. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep for much of the day. Some hedgehogs hibernate, but others stay awake all year round.

I was a student travelling around Europe and Morocco in a van. I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront. I spent much of my time drawing and was lucky enough to be carrying an ample sketchbook when I met Picasso. Picasso was known to be a reclusive artist. He spent most of his time shut away working high in the hills. I was surprised to find him seated at a table with his wife and companions. I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook. Picasso agreed to sign my sketchbook. He inscribed his name across the top of the paper and added an exuberant linear flourish. I was delighted and thanked him. I returned to Picasso's table and drew his portrait. He gave me a generous nod and announced that it was now his turn. He outlined a bearded face below the head which had taken me so many anxious minutes to produce. I looked like a creature who had strayed from one of his more lighthearted mythological compositions. I thanked Picasso and asked him if he would be kind enough to sign the drawing. He said that he already had his signature. I was disappointed, but I still look back now and wonder at my good fortune. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant an enormous amount to me."

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has not been able to keep up with the pace of economic change. As a result, most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised.
Even if you visit a supermarket, you will not buy that many advertised brands. You are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands over a year. And most of the clothes you buy will not be advertised brands.
If you are watching TV tonight, count how many of the commercials are for brands you buy or are likely to buy in the future. For most people, the figure seems to be about one in 16 (6 per cent). So the commercials for the other 15 (94 per cent) are, on the face of it, wasted."

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, he thought he was seeing scientific proof that fairies really existed. He published photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered."

I had a lot of problems learning to use computers, but I managed to learn the basic skills I needed. I have become an organised worker and I can now work from home. I have also been able to start freelancing for a magazine.

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.
The latest print circulation figures show that sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference.
The latest National Readership Survey figures show that nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 follow the main national dailies.
Of course, this huge difference isn’t good news for newspaper companies. Maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex and expensive."

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you have to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to consider the background and the environment. If you can find a good spot and position the camera correctly, you can take great pictures of people.

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although it is easier to capture newsworthy events with digital cameras and camera phones, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that a large number of people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most popular.
Acupuncture points are located on meridians, which are lines that run through the body. When the flow of energy (Qi) is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become sick. To treat imbalances, acupuncturists use fine needles inserted into the skin.
Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.
If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you."

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
However, there is little hard evidence to support the claims made about handwriting analysis. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. They say, handwriting is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance."

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)
This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. We followed a new route and spent a lot of time on the ridge.

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

No title. Many trees in the Brackham area were blown down in a terrible storm that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had changed the appearance of the town centre entirely. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force, was annoyed by the change. He was sick with bronchitis and couldn't concentrate on his work. His wife, Molly, tried to persuade him to go to the doctor, but he refused. He was too busy working. When he finally gave in and went to the doctor, he was prescribed antibiotics and went home. The loss of the trees had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The room seemed cruelly bright and the worn furnishings were exposed in all their shabbiness.

If you enter this world, remember one thing: you must fall in love with an object before you collect it. People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. Others collect flowers, pottery or paintings. If you want to start a collection, you do not have to be rich or powerful. You can start with small items like tulip bulbs or china cups. You can also collect toys or other items that you enjoy. As small objects become popular, they begin to rise in price. The toys of the 1950s are now positively an investment.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. People in Britain spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter and Christmas. The cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec and Mayan civilisations of Central America thousands of years ago. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, cacao beans are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, a Dutch inventor named CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to produce a solid block that you could eat."

Children at specialist music schools spend a lot of time on musical activities, but also have a restricted academic programme. The cost of attending a specialist music school is high, but there are scholarships and financial assistance available. There are also concerns about the pressure and stress that can be associated with sending children to boarding school at a young age. If you are considering sending your child to a specialist music school, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes.
Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.
Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt.
Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way they could continue their journey was to take what was affectionately known as the Desert Express.

If you want to get your story published, you need to do some research and practice your writing skills. You should find out which magazines use the type of writing you want to do and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then, familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. If you want to become a successful writer, you need to write a lot and keep practicing. You should also join a local writers' group or take a creative writing course.

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.
One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pesticides and other chemicals can build up in the bodies of dolphins and be passed on to their young. This can cause a number of health problems, including death.
Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, dolphins may not be able to find enough food to survive. They are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets.
Finally, human disturbance is a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand. This can lead to a number of problems, including death."

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.
The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.
Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to let people look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.
The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors."

There are no easy ways of becoming an actor. You need to be lucky and talented. But there is also the possibility of excitement, glamour and the occasional rich reward.
If you ask actors how they have done well in the profession, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job.

Week after week, newspapers in Britain publish pictures that can intrude into people's privacy. Sometimes, pictures of celebrities are taken without their consent. This can cause great damage to individuals in the public eye. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures that are published in newspapers are often not in the public interest. They are often private pictures of celebrities. If a celebrity feels that their privacy has been invaded, they may complain to the PCC, but very few actually do. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. However, there are some problems with this idea. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry. And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, the PCC might still proceed. There is also the embarrassment factor to consider. People may not want to be further embarrassed by an investigation. Overall, there is no easy solution to this problem."

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency."

The First Woman Scientist Hypatia was born in Alexandria, in Egypt, in 370 A.D. She was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books for many centuries. Hypatia's father was a teacher, and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria where she began teaching mathematics. She soon became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We have no copies of her books, but we know that she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work. At the time, many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone connected with it was in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

The Young Achiever of the Year Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion. She has won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her parents that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a loan and begin her own womenswear label. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over PS500,000. Her clothes appear in fashion magazines, she designs for pop stars and she has just gained public recognition by winning this award. Her business has come a long way and she knows she is extremely lucky."

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer."

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb. We planned to camp for three days. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. The track was steep and there was a lot of snow. We had to be careful. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. It was a clear day. You can see the sea and the island of Skye. However, the mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. I was glad we had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience.

We had everything we needed, and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, I met the other members of our group. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we'd done.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. Sharks are dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. Sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, the guests were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. The rest of the hotel is completed in the following weeks. The ice hotel melts in the spring. Guests can wear warm clothes and socks inside the hotel, but they need to bring their own sweaters and scarves. If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the website. You can also order equipment and book your visit at the same time. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. You can get there by bus from the airport or train station.

A new furniture shop called Homestyle was opened last Thursday. Many people went to the shop to buy furniture. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa and a bed. The shop was very busy and had to be closed soon after it opened. The people outside the shop became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop. This meant that the road was completely blocked. One customer, Jenny Smith, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.'"

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. In the 1970s, people thought that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They made films that both adults and children could enjoy. Not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, people arrived in San Francisco in their thousands hoping to find gold. However, it was not the men looking for the gold that got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison."

In the past, people wore shoes that were not comfortable or fashionable. They were probably made of animal skin. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only one hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made by machines. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

I started a running group for women in my area because I was annoyed by the lack of women in the sport and the lack of separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. They ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general.

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold found in Alaska. Many people came to the area to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a while.
In the winter, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail.
Nowadays, there is a dog sled race held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

But, as many winters have been dry in recent times, when the rain does come, it is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food.

For one group of children, Saturdays are special. They learn how to cook. Their lessons are popular. There is a waiting list of children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee for the course. The children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
There is a young boy named Bill who loves his mum's cooking. He can do it better than his mum. The teachers make the children laugh. They share the food they've made.
There is also a young girl named Flora who loves cooking. She did a meal for ten friends. Her mum suggested she take up a hobby. Flora was happy staying at home. She wasn't too keen at first. But she's glad she decided to come.
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun.' The children pay attention and remember things better than adults. Although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking, they have a lot of fun."

Winter driving is dangerous because it's difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents happen easily. Fog can be waiting for you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hidden beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen. If you drive smoothly and gently, you can avoid trouble. You should also allow extra space for stopping when the road is wet, snow, or ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will avoid trouble.

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. There he found the drawing classes difficult, but he still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art, and he became interested in early Italian artists. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished."

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. We were not sure whether to give him the drums because of the noise. But Ben argued that it was better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, we gave in. We said, 'All right,' but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.
Because drums are not easy to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their singing.
I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are, but one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It gives young people the opportunity to study for their exams and learn about life outside the classroom. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education."

I am an older student. I finished my first year at university. I have to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after many years away from school. I was bored doing my job as a secretary. I was unhappy because I felt stuck in my job. I was jealous of the students at the university. I am glad that I have the opportunity to study. I know that I need a qualification to get a rewarding job. I prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. I also have the normal student benefits of long holidays and theatre and cinema discounts.

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he began working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After he had driven it a long way, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T'. It was a simple car that sold for $825. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she went up the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!' When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When the weather gets colder, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are very cold in Canada. Last spring, Bill found some young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the winter.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived, Bill flew to the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in the United States and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to the United States to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him."

When Esther left school, her aunt gave her a lot of money. She used the money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar and some jars and began making jam. She sold the jam to her friends and she soon made a lot of money. Her parents didn't want her to spend her time making jam and they thought that she should study instead. But Esther didn't listen to them. She just kept on making jam. After a few months, she started selling it to the local market. Then she started making orange juice. She sold this to a school where one of her friends worked. After two years, her business was very large and her parents were very pleased with her. She made all kinds of food which she sold to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to get some people to work for her.

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens. They also have sheep. Jenny has a lot of sheep. Each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep. Jenny made some sweaters and socks with the wool. Everybody loved the socks because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had a lot of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory. There are lots of different socks. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present.

BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also call the police if you see anything strange.

The history of farming. Long ago, people used to go to the forest to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people began to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and build bigger villages. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes."

This is what she told us about her job: 'My office is at the airport, but I spend most of my time flying. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems. I also go to lots of meetings. My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses. Sometimes I go on long flights to check how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favourite part of the job, but I like office work, too. Travelling can be hard work. When I get back from a long journey, all I can do is eat something and then go to bed!

The Weather People are interested in the weather for a lot of reasons. It is important for people in many different jobs. For example, the weather makes a big difference for farmers. Many years ago, farmers spent a long time looking at the sky and at animals and flowers to try and learn more about the weather. Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain.

I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat well. Also I drink a lot of water because it's good for your health. I should have about eight glasses a day but I don't always drink so much. People shouldn't work all the time. I love my job but there are other things I like doing too. In my free time, I just listen to music or watch TV. It's good to do nothing sometimes. I don't get tired any more since the doctor told me to eat better. Now I eat lots of things like carrots and spinach every day. But I still eat burgers sometimes."

'Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a lot higher than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.'"

I have just been to England to work on a radio programme about the English language and also to talk about the book I've just written. Most writers don't like doing this; they don't like travelling around the country, selling their book. I don't mind it. I like visiting new places and meeting lots of people. It's very different from the life I have in the United States when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was good because I didn't have to pay any bills. Everyone was kind to me and it was fun.

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dog. The two smaller sizes first came to England a long time ago. The Giant Schnauzer has not been here very long. The name Giant is a good one because the dogs are tall. All the dogs have long hair, which should be cut quite often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey in colour, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use the dogs to help them with their sheep. They are also used by the police, because Schnauzer dogs are very intelligent. A Schnauzer makes a nice family dog. It is friendly and very good with young children.

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.
You need clothes that are light but warm. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five. It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

They live in the open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. All cats need good eyes and they also need to be fast and strong. '

Dear Mrs. Brian,
I'm sorry, but I have to go back to my country. My sister is getting married next month. I want to go shopping with her to choose a dress. My parents are going to make a big meal for the guests. There will be a lot of work in the kitchen. I'm sorry I have to leave the English class. You are a very good teacher. Please say goodbye to the other students for me. Thanks again. Best wishes, Soraya.

Dear Lorna,
How are you? I'm happy because I got a new job in the city centre. I work in a Tourist Information Office and it is very interesting.

Here is a photo of me. I'm wearing my new uniform. Do you like it? Love, Gloria

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. It can be more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in Africa. There are not many of them left. Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.

Victoria, a student from Britain, started snowboarding a few years ago. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her when she was at a snowboarding competition last week in Switzerland. We asked her why she started snowboarding. ""I like all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.""
We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""
We asked her what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!"""

Dear Sir or Madam,
I would like to book a room at your hotel for three nights, from September 15th to 17th. I would like a single room with a shower and a telephone in the room. Can I have a quiet room on the ground floor? I am going to drive to the hotel. Is there a parking lot for guests? I will arrive at about 10.30 p.m. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? If possible, I would like to have a meal when I arrive. Thank you for your help.
Yours faithfully,

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are a few ways to climb Kilimanjaro. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Not many people who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is because the weather can change so quickly. Sometimes it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to pack sunglasses and warm clothes.

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for the otters. But today there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

17 Green Street, Camden, London. 29th August 2002. Dear John, Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a very good teacher. I enjoyed my stay in Cambridge. Now I am staying at my brother's flat. He is studying to be a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go home to Greece. I like London very much. We travelled to the park by bus yesterday. It was very sunny and we had a good time. Tonight, I am going to see a film with my brother and some of his friends. I'll write again from Greece.

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.

Indre, I have a problem. I need your help to buy some new clothes. My grandmother is going to turn 80 next month and she is having a party on Saturday. I have grown so much that all my trousers are too short for me now. I want to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots. I haven't got a lot of money but I think it will be enough. Would you like to come shopping with me tomorrow? Let me know. Sarika.

The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. There are a lot of green hills and fields on the road between them. There is a picture of a very large man on one of these hills. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think that it was a long time ago. To get nearer the picture, you can walk from Cerne. If you go on the first of May when the sun comes up, you will see all the people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer and a teacher and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books. Now, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes into his office and writes. In the evening, he gives the work to his wife to read. She tells me when she doesn't like something. Bill writes about the life in his village and on the farms near it. His fifth book is his favourite. The Sheepdog is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used the latest computer technology to make people think that the animals are speaking. Bill was very pleased with the film.

Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. Postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then."

Dinosaurs were very long ago. No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died a long time ago, before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was very long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also it could run fast because it had long back legs.

The bear is a strong animal. It can be dangerous. The adult bear is very strong and it can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and they can run very fast. But they cannot see well and, like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are two kinds of bear: The largest is the white polar bear, which is almost three metres tall. There is one kind of black bear that lives in the forests of North America. Not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is difficult to find food.

Crocodiles live in tropical parts of the world, such as Africa, South America and Northern Australia. They spend most of their time in slow-moving water, but they can move fast through the water and on land. You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch, like fish, birds and small animals. And sometimes they make a meal of large animals or even people. There are more than ten types of crocodile. They all have very sharp teeth. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles live for a long time. The oldest one kept in a zoo was 66 years old.

In 1783, two French brothers built the first balloon. A hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew in it. This was in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office began the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. Then, in the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane. It is difficult to think of a world without them.

The Globe Theatre was a long time ago in London. It was different from a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. You can still visit the Globe Theatre today. There is a new theatre there. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.

Dear Jeff, I'm having a good holiday in Australia. The weather was bad and cold when we arrived two weeks ago. Now the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. We are staying in Sydney this week. Next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm and I loved swimming there. The fish were different: red, yellow, purple. Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue
