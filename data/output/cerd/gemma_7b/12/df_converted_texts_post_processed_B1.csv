Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be a source of stress and dissatisfaction. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be willing to learn new things. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to compete in the job market.
In addition to the above, you also need to be able to work well with others. This means that you need to be able to cooperate, be empathetic, and be able to build strong relationships. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to be successful in your career.
There are a number of things that you can do to improve your work life. First, you need to make sure that you are communicating effectively. This means that you need to be able to listen to others, be able to express yourself clearly, and be able to build strong relationships. Second, you need to be creative and willing to learn new things. Third, you need to be able to work well with others. If you can do these things, you will be more likely to be successful in your career."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television."

Sometimes it seems that no matter how much stuff you have, you don't feel secure. It is good to have a home that meets your needs, but there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. If you don't have one of these things, you will be a lesser human being. To see how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.
Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years. Because of their presence as natural phenomena, caves have had a long history of study. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere. Countless observant people originally laid the foundations of meteorology. Satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us with the minimum of delay. Computers solve complex mathematical sums at a speed beyond the capability of the human brain. Meteorological theory is complex, but human experience is still the vital ingredient which translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere."

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily theatre, while music comes first in an opera. Music is inherently theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, and vulnerability. It can reach into the imagination of the listener not just as an individual but as part of a collective.
The conventions which still largely dominate music presentation, including strict dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasize the difference between players and listeners in a way which often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. The tendency of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a canicular piece of virtuosity can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the whole work.
There are a few things that can be done to change the conventions of music-going. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. Some plays get put on in unconventional locations, where normal expectations are disrupted. These locations can have startling effects on performer and audience alike."

Sand is a natural barrier that can be harmful. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects. When you are wet, sand adheres to you like 'stucco'. But, when you step onto a beach towel or climb into a car, the sand falls off. It can also stay with you for a long time.
Locks and keys have been used for a long time to keep people safe. They provide a sense of security and privacy. However, some people don't like computerised locking systems. They prefer physical keys. One locksmith company developed a new electronic system that incorporated a proper metal key.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.
The film studios The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a confusing place. It was made up of numerous small rooms, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations. To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung round the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. As a child, I had some notion of the oddity of her personality. She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate.
Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city."

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was high. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses on the street, and I remembered them all. The houses had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses had become stores, and the stores had become homes. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?
I swam in the pool. The warm rain tumbled from the gutter. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm intensified, drowning birdsong, and a haze rose off the water as though the pool itself were rising to meet the lowering sky. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage."

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social function. It can help people to develop attachments, express helplessness, and promote trust and social connectedness. Tears can also be shed involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches, or when we are watching a sentimental film.

The Earth is getting warmer due to human activity. This is causing changes to the weather and the planet's climate. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water and soils. They are also having a significant impact on human societies.
The main cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth's atmosphere to warm up. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased significantly over the last 100 years. This is due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
Climate change is causing a number of changes to the planet's climate. These changes include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in the timing of seasons, and changes in the distribution of ecosystems. These changes are having a negative impact on many human societies.
The most severe consequences of climate change are rising sea levels and increased flooding. Rising sea levels are caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the melting of glaciers. Increased flooding is a major problem for coastal communities around the world. It can damage infrastructure, destroy homes and livelihoods, and displace people."

A middle-aged, married couple is wanted for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. If multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition, this will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel. Fuel efficiency is a priority. The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031. It's a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies. Given that these can be put in place soon enough, the spacecraft might just make it. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to achieve these ambitious goals will not be in vain, as they will lead to valuable advances for future missions."

Aesthetics is a field that studies the nature of beauty and art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. This makes it difficult to understand how artworks relate to human experiences. Additionally, the perfection of some artworks and their long history of admiration create conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When artworks are isolated from their original conditions and experiences, they become difficult to understand. To understand artworks, we need to forget them for a time and turn aside from them. Instead, we need to focus on the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. This means that we need to arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. Once we have done this, we can appreciate artworks in their raw form and enjoy them as part of our daily experiences."

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, alongside these psychological and financial imperatives lies an almost paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there's some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Reading a great book guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is used in many different ways, including national events, individual activities, and education. It is also beneficial to our health and well-being.
There are a few things that need to be done in order to ensure that music continues to have a positive impact on our lives. First, we need to make music more accessible to everyone. This means providing more opportunities for people to learn to play instruments and to participate in music-related activities. Second, we need to support the music profession. This means providing professional musicians with the resources they need to be successful. Third, we need to raise the profile of music itself. This means making people aware of the many benefits of music and encouraging them to listen to and enjoy it."

The craft of acting is often met with disdain and contempt.

Blogging: Confessing to the World
Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing everything on the internet.
There are a lot of benefits to blogging, such as wealth and fame. But there are also risks, such as being fired from your job or having your privacy violated.
In the early days of the web, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started blogging. He was one of the first bloggers, and he showed that you can use blogging to share your life with the world.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world and distant parts of the solar system. It has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

There are different ways to write poetry, but the most important thing is to find your own style.

I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving. I have taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are held at different times and places. There are two main types of poets: those who write poems to be printed and read on the page, and those who write poems to be performed to an audience. The latter poets often use simple verses and easy to understand language. They can only profit from public performance. The other poets write poems that are more complex and difficult to understand. They are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience that is encountering their work for the first time. Attendance at poetry reading cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page, though it can be an enjoyable and instructive adjunct.

These are four topics that are being discussed in this text. Each topic has its own unique set of challenges and considerations.
**Oral History:**
- Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
- Memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources.
- Feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony.
**Animal Science:**
- There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal.
- The two approaches are closely related.
- The methods used to study animal behaviour are important.
**Social Sciences:**
- Students who come to study a social science for the first time must familiarise themselves with the substance and methodology of the subject.
- The social sciences are not simply a matter of common sense.
- Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life.
**Classical Architecture:**
- Architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings in the classical world.
- The origins of classical architecture are complex.
- The classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut."

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line, shooting the bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
They drove to the English Channel and Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to grant this. They parked in a small street off the sea front and Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings.
Chen put a coin in the slot and trained the glass on the ship. He was unable to find it at first, although he had aimed off carefully. He swung the tube in wide circles and finally found the ship. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece and showed him the ship.
The ship was small and old, but Chen knew that it was the ship that would take them all back home. He kissed the top of Man Kee's head and Lily put her arm round Husband's shoulders."

I had read that from a deep hole, one could see the stars. I had persuaded you to help me with my plan. I climbed into the well and fell. I cracked my head and saw lights. It was like seeing stars in a cartoon panel. I was scared and relieved. You called down and asked if I was all right. I lay still and waited for help. You came and called for help. I was pulled out of the well. I was tired and scared. I ran away and hid in the shadows. My mother and father came to see me. My mother screamed and my father shouted. I felt ashamed and helpless. I knew I had done something wrong. I apologized to my parents. I was punished. I felt bad about myself.

The Internet has made it easier for people to share their opinions about books. Anyone can write a review on Amazon, which is the largest online bookstore. This has led to a lot of silliness, but it also provides a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book is worth buying.
The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com are serious and provide a good indication of whether or not a book is worth reading. However, there is also a lot of silliness. For example, some people write reviews that are simply personal attacks on the author, while others write reviews that contain obscenities or give away the ending of the book. Despite this, the reviews collectively provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying."

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.
There is a new situation that I am going to describe. An artist chooses a piece of text and asks someone to make a canvas for him. He then asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. The finished product is a painting.
The problem is that the art-buying public expects artists to stick to one genre. If an artist tries to strike out in a new direction, they are usually met with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.
I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side."

However, I knew that my father was proud of me and I was grateful for that.

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The house was not suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.

I chose this place to live, hoping to find anonymity. But people in the shops soon start to recognise me. The roses in my garden were loved once, but they are gone now. I usually stay inside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying. I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.
My upstairs neighbour, Jaz, is leaning out of the window. She is a writer and I sometimes call upon her to dissemble about her unpublished manuscripts. I have a copy of the latest in my possession now.
We talk for a while and then she leaves. I am alone again in my garden. It looks mangled and bereft. The only access to this garden is through my flat and Jaz is banging on my door.

Heritage gives people and communities a sense of connection with the past. It is important for understanding and interpreting our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a fundamental desire for continuity. It affects everything from customs to material culture.
Museums make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. Museums which rise to the challenge and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.
Architecture and Environment
The desire to preserve things is not new. Change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it. Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it."

Einstein was a famous scientist who developed some mysterious theories about time and space. He made a big contribution to science by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals.

Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals.
Young Readers Throughout our childhoods, we sometimes thought that prize-winning books were boring. Our father would often give us books as gifts, and we would dismiss most of them as 'boys' books'. But he did expose us to some shorter works of decent fiction and, just once, to a well-known anthology of verse.
Language has a fascinating history. It probably developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. In the main speech was used for friendly interaction, and was an important tool in power struggles. Information-swapping was probably not an important original role."

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the subject matter. They also need to be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy.
However, reviewing is not a primary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough."

His flat had been waiting for him, and he was grateful that it was still intact. He had grown impatient with its inability to be transformed. There was a small puddle of letters and a red eye of the answering machine that could sometimes be found resuscitated. He would often read or listen to music as the night deepened outside.

I was going to witness goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There was a lot of people and food stalls at the racecourse. I had to fight my way through the crowds to get a good spot. The racecourse was not very big, but it was similar to other racecourses. The goats were being kept in order. It was difficult to keep the goats in order because they eat a lot. As the day drew to a close, I started to think about the night ahead. There was no place to stop and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since early morning. We couldn't see what was happening, but we could hear the roaring noise of fast-rushing water. Time stood still, and we moved on."

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself. The third is slower than thought. This slower mode of thinking is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury."

I have been welcomed warmly to a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very isolated place. There are a lot of people living there, but I don't have much trouble communicating. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely, or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.
One day, I met a person named Elliot. He took no notice of me at first, but he remembered me later on. We haven't spoken much since then. But I recently had a success as a playwright, and he started to treat me differently. He asked me to lunch and I thought he was trying to test me out. But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting. He cared about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, the audience should scream at the same moment. Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable. He was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience."

Amateur Astronomy
Many things have changed in astronomy over the past fifty years. There were not many charts and catalogues, and telescopic equipment was limited. Today, there are many more charts and telescopes available. Computers have made it easier to produce charts and analyze observations. All this makes it a good time for amateur astronomy.
However, there has also been a loss of simplicity. Now you have to travel farther to find a sky that is comparable to the sky in urban areas fifty years ago. The daytime skies are now filled with aircraft condensation trails which can last for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.
Society is also becoming more complex. There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. This can be stressful and tiring. As a result, there is a new trend emerging: the search for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world.
McAndrews Hotel
Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition that has been going on for many years. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days."

Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. The play is a tragedy and it is important to maintain the age difference between Othello and Desdemona. However, I think that Mr Fearon's acting is magnificent and I eat my words about the rest of his performance. The whole cast is magnificent and the scenes are memorable. The pace and tension throughout the play are terrific. Do not miss this production.
Lake Vostok In the heart of Antarctica, there is a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for millions of years. Biologists and geologists are eager to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within.
Scientists There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. Scientists are debating why we want to know so much about the universe. Some scientists believe that the desire to understand everything is the driving force behind scientific inquiry. However, others argue that the real question is why we want to know all of this in the first place. Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than get bogged down in debates over the point of it all."

Writing and reading are two enjoyable activities that require effort. Handwritten text is often more enjoyable to read than text written on a screen. This is because the slowness of handwriting forces the brain to focus and concentrate. It also encourages people to write more carefully. However, the convenience of computers has led to a decline in handwriting. Most writers using word processors find that the time spent correcting early drafts is more or less equates with the time originally spent on handwritten text. Similarly, the e-mail, unlike the handwritten letter, is emotionally ponderous. It is said to have revived the art of the love letter. But printed words written in haste lack the care and character of handwriting.
Books versus Electronic Text
Reading books is a more enjoyable experience than reading text on a screen. Books encourage people to read more slowly and carefully. They also allow people to think about the text in a more joined-up way. Computers do not invite the same joined-up thinking. They encourage people to dip into text rather than read it in its entirety.

In England, breakfast is an important meal according to health experts. However, breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England. There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles. In the sixteenth century, it gradually became the norm to have breakfast. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Other factors that may have contributed to the greater importance now attached to breakfast include new patterns of employment. Often, people started work very early, so having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity.

When a photographer takes a photograph, they choose visual information that is determined by their technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience. The photographer's choice of visual information affects the style, content and expression of a photograph. It also affects how the image is perceived and responded to by the viewer.
Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it can also teach you the benefits of working as one of a team. It's very much like life - you can succeed as an individual, but you must never forget there are others around you.
Some experiences etch themselves so sharply on our memory that they form islands of clarity in our recollection.

Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. Birds have been flitting through the undergrowth of British culture ever since it began. In medieval times, wrens were used to determine the sort of luck the observer would experience. In modern times, the image of the wren remains in pictures and ceramics in many British households. The loss of birds is a cultural loss. Folklore is so important. Stories, legends and rhymes which persist through time have a greater living bond with their subjects than cold, scientific terms.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content. The development of cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. Today, cartography is used in many sciences, including geology, history, and geography."

Climate and weather, which are created by the air around us, also have a big impact on our lives. They can affect the distribution of animals and plants.

Television often fails to showcase the pleasure and complexity of looking at paintings and sculptures. There are few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of art.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can find insects by tapping the surface of the wood and listening for reverberations. The aye-aye can also sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose.

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like? We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing.
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each."

Marlowe's epic play, Tamburlaine the Great, is a thrilling night of the year. It is a long play, but it is worth seeing. The acting is excellent, and the staging is impressive.
There are also several other plays that are worth seeing this season. One play is The Women Laughing Welcome, which is a powerful and compassionate study of the devastating effects of illness. Another play is Amphibians, which is a well-written play about the decline of the fishing industry. And finally, there is Murder by Misadventure, which is a traditional thriller.
If you are looking for a night out at the theatre, there are several great plays to choose from this season. So, go see a play and enjoy the show!"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around.
The cubs were playful and would chase each other's tails. I also saw odder badgers in our field. We built a sett for the badgers to move into. The cubs finally moved into their new home. Now, I see the cubs only occasionally, but they still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.

In the 17th century, Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass. These variations, known as declination, are the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various places, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland. From these travels, he published a chart that showed the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. His work was instrumental for seamen for more than a century.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate Halley's accomplishments by retracing his route. He has already spent two years in Antarctica and has a deep understanding of geomagnetism. Clark's expedition will involve making precise measurements of declination using advanced instruments. The data collected will help refine existing mathematical models of Earth's magnetic field.
Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has the necessary experience and skills to complete the journey, and he is also prepared to dedicate himself fully to the project."

Peacocks that live in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks tail was not necessarily advantageous. Darwin felt that the tail was a waste of space and a severe encumbrance.
The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now trying to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
The study of peacocks at Whipsnade is providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of evolution. It is also helping to clarify Darwin's theories."

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not significantly changed genetically. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities between humans and animals exist. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.
There are three main distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and not for survival or reproduction. Second, human art is learned rather than instinctive. Third, human art is transmitted by learning rather than by genes.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

The most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for the health of our body. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. The second theory emphasizes the learning benefits of sleep. It holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day. The third theory is based on ideas about energy. It says that we need periods of sleep in order to recharge our batteries and have an adequate supply of energy for the coming day.

It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity. The desire to be accepted and loved is stronger than the desire to stand out in the crowd. People who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems.

Volunteer tourism is a topic that is discussed by four academic writers. They argue that while volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, the actual contribution to development is often not as great as it seems. However, volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities. Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development."

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. One common way to wake up is the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available models.
We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. The wide snooze bar means you can tap it on the edge with your eyes shut. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing when I finally looked at the instruction booklet.
The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out in order to use a hairdryer or the vacuum cleaner. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.
The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'."

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The effectiveness of this defence mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered."

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been making weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but they are still admired for their artistry.
There has been a recent revival in blacksmithing. This is due to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.
No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good."

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense'. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business. But when it comes to locating water, she needs nothing more than a forked hazel stick. The couple's success rate is higher than 90 per cent.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. After that, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the stick rises up. If she disagrees with her husband about the exact spot to drill, they won't drill and will keep looking until they agree.
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?"

Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand.

His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career.
Hardenberger has a gift of finding the right compromise and making that relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre.
Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. He is a thoughtful and humble musician who is passionate about his work."

New In Paperback A is a novel set in the fictional republic of Efica. The book is notable for its humour, and for the author's unique vision, which is combined with his penetrating psychological insight in a novel which is difficult but rewarding.

Sheila, a traditional working-class woman, is so wracked with guilt that she requests a meeting - from which their unusual friendship grows. The author is skilled at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life."

Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.
A good leader is one who inspires, motivates, and encourages others. To be a good leader, you need to be able to speak out clearly and with conviction, and be able to make things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are.
You also need to be able to recognise your own potential for leadership and develop your skills. If you are a natural transactor, try being the negotiator. If you always ask for the views of others, try taking the lead.
Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes. To be a successful leader, you need to be able to delegate and motivate, organise and chastise, praise and raise."

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. The latest print circulation figures show that sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Yet, the messages are oddly mixed. Books and magazines are also changing. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, but booksellers found that sales of physical books have only decreased slightly. The best way of attracting a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package.

People are the most interesting subjects for photography. Photographs with people in them are usually more compelling than pictures without them. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take good pictures of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures, and expressions. You also need to be mindful of the presence of the camera.
There are a few things you can do to improve your pictures of people. First, avoid straight lines in group shots. Second, help your subject relax and find a comfortable position. Third, make sure that the subject is not overwhelmed by the background. Fourth, ask your subject to look into the lens. Fifth, use expressions and gestures to add interest to your pictures. Sixth, consider the situation and use it to your advantage. Seventh, take pictures of people interacting with each other. Finally, remember that pictures of people are often taken on holiday or during an outing. To show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building (or mountain, or lake) in the frame.

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received the most attention.
Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become sick.
Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also used to treat other conditions, such as nausea, vomiting, and indigestion.
If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you."

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.
Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether a person is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other serious problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them."

Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But the snow and wind were not the biggest threat to us. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder and the dam was filling up quickly. One day, the dam overflowed and the river surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild and dangerous. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy the huge clouds that hang over the valley and be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection, we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."

Film Critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. That was how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lacking in self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of his reviews appeared, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but it didn't work out as planned. Mark chose film as his area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, they would hardly have come up with the present arrangement. The space he is given allows him to broaden his argument or forces him, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing."

These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and also made a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable and spread it to Europe. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented and the age of the chocolate bar began.

The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
The dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to gather samples, and then three hours to get back up to the surface.
When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two thirds of her salary comes from teaching.
The only time Rachel has been frightened is when she first went down with the Americans. There was an explosion and she thought, ""I'm going to die.""
It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder."

I was tired, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't take any more punishment. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year and the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe.
I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.
Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognise this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days, or be in a different climate zone, thousands of miles from home, wearing wholly unsuitable clothes. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The baggage system can fail for many reasons, including extra security checks, air traffic problems, human error, and accidents. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.

The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It feeds on fish. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream. He missed lessons, becoming what he describes as an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only member of its cosmopolitan family to breed in Europe, was getting noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

To help a child who shows exceptional musical ability, there are a few options. One option is to attend a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five specialist music schools that provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. These schools offer a wide range of musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. However, there are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school, such as the cost and the pressure to succeed. If you are considering sending your child to a specialist music school, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

On the rails, five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.
Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.
Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. The journey itself was lovely and the dress she wore on the train was a gift from her husband.
Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. The train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes he had ever seen.
Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life."

If you want to get your story published, you need to do some research and practice your writing skills. To be successful, you need to know the markets you are aiming at and what publishers are looking for. You can find out about this by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.
Once you have done your research, you need to start writing. Write as much as you can and improve your writing skills with each story you write. Don't be afraid to get feedback from other writers or teachers, but don't show your work to anyone else in the early stages. If you have the time and resources, consider taking a creative writing course or joining a local writers' group.

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.
The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.
Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.
Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand."

Getting fit is essential for your mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It improves the condition of your heart and lungs and blood circulation. It also helps to ease depression and tiredness, and regulate sleep patterns. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. The best exercise, therefore, involves a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout and definitely a cool down period."

Young shoppers at the supermarket often make a lot of demands. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar-coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often struggle to deal with their children's demands when shopping. They feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. And they get cross and defensive in anticipation as they leave home.
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. A lot of money is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate.
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. They refuse to buy their children the sweets they want on the grounds that it's bad for them while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves.

Ice skating has a long history. People have been skating for thousands of years. In the past, people used skates made from animal bone. Nowadays, skating is both graceful and physically demanding. To skate, you need to be relaxed and have good balance and control. You also need to know how to fall safely. If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. There are different styles of skating, but the basic figures can be learned with proper guidance. Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation and movement. It also improves heart and lung activity and generally strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness."

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to let people look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.
The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.
The drawings are an important part of French history and should be preserved for future generations. If we do not take steps to protect them, they will be lost forever."

Young shoppers at the supermarket often make a lot of demands. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar-coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often struggle to deal with their children's demands when shopping. They feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. And they get cross and defensive in anticipation as they leave home.
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. A lot of money is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate.
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. They refuse to buy their children the sweets they want on the grounds that it's bad for them while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves.
Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas."

Going up the wall was once a challenging climb that could only be done in the mountains. Now, a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, climbers used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many of these early walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education who, during the mid-1960s, constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University.

If you want to be an actor, it's a risky career. There are a lot of actors, but not enough jobs. If you choose to become an actor, people may tell you you're crazy. But it's a personal choice and only you can take responsibility for yourself. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You need luck and talent. There is a demand for new faces and new talent. Acting is all about making contact with the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted. Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. You need to be prepared for rejection. If you don't care enough, no-one will care for you."

Chris Greener was tall when he was young. He is the tallest man in Britain today. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

The Model Village was once a piece of waste ground that was transformed into a beautiful masterpiece. The village was created by one man named Colin Sims and his wife. They worked hard to change the land into the sculpted landscape you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to create the village. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were also planted. The models in the village are made from a variety of materials, including stone, concrete, and wood. They are very detailed and accurate. The village is popular and has been used as an example of high-quality workmanship.

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. These pictures often damage individuals in the public eye when they see their most private moments captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do pictures of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. However, there are also some problems with this idea. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?"
