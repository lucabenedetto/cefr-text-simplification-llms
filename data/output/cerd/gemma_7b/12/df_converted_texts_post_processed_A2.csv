Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be a source of stress and dissatisfaction. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be able to work well with others, and be able to adapt to change.
If you are not satisfied with your current job, there are a few things you can do. You can try to find a new job that better suits your interests and skills. You can also try to improve your current job by talking to your boss about your concerns. If you are able to make some changes to your job, you may be able to find more satisfaction and fulfillment.
In addition to finding a job that you enjoy, there are a few other things you can do to improve your overall well-being. You can exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and get enough sleep. You can also spend time with friends and family, and engage in activities that you enjoy. If you are able to make some positive changes to your lifestyle, you may be able to improve your mood and overall happiness."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can be very persuasive, and it can make you feel like you need things you don't have. To see how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.
Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years, and there is a lot of research about them. Caves are also important because they have a long history of study. However, exploring caves can be physically demanding, so cave research has been less in the hands of learned professors than other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of weather. It has been around for centuries, and it has become a very technical science. Satellites and electronic instruments provide us with a lot of weather information, and computers can solve complex math problems quickly. However, human experience is still the most important part of meteorology. It's the human observations that translate data into weather forecasts."

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily theatre, while music comes first in an opera. Music is a powerful and expressive art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including listening to recordings, attending concerts, and performing. Theatre is also a powerful art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including watching plays, attending festivals, and participating in acting classes.
There are some similarities between music and theatre. For example, they both require skill and dedication. They also both have the ability to entertain and inspire people. However, there are also some differences between music and theatre. For example, music is more focused on sound, while theatre is more focused on acting and storytelling. Music is also more portable, while theatre is more confined to specific locations.
Overall, music and theatre are two complementary art forms that can enrich our lives in many ways. They can evoke a wide range of emotions, entertain us, and inspire us."

Sand is a natural barrier that can be harmful. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects. When you are wet, sand adheres to you like 'stucco'. But, when you are dry, sand easily falls off. It can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.
A lock and key are used to keep things safe. People like locks and keys because they make them feel secure. Some people don't like computerised locking systems. When one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure they incorporated a proper metal key into the device.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting information. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.
The film studios The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a confusing place. It was made up of numerous small rooms, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations. To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing.
Film-makers Almost everybody, it seems, wants to make a movie. If ever dreams came true, they did for Rodriguez - and ahead of schedule. Recalling his 23rd birthday in his book about his Mariachi adventures, he writes: ""Orson Welles made Citizen Kane when he was 25. Spielberg made Laws at 26. So I've only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film."""

In those days, there were many council houses in West Earlham. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was quite the most solitary person I have ever known. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked.

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the air was thick with a drizzle that made my walk feel sheltered. I knew this side of the street well. There were many houses down the street that I was familiar with. They had been as distinct to me as the little troughs in the cement that led rainwater out to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became smaller. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses that had once been homes had become stores, and the stores that had once been homes had become houses again. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?
I swam in the pool one day. The rain fell down and made the water sparkle. I nosed along, eyes just at water level. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. It was a beautiful day. I wanted to swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea. Swimming is a subversive activity. It allows us to regain a sense of what is old and wild."

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is probably true. Scientists have found that crying has a social function. It can help people to connect with each other and build relationships. It can also be used to express sympathy and sadness. Sometimes, people cry involuntarily when they hear music or speeches that make them feel sad. We may also cry when watching a movie that makes us feel sad.

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Plants and animals are being affected by these changes, as well as water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.
Some of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in glacial processes, and rising sea levels. The consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe, with many people losing their homes and livelihoods.
It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. We also need to develop new technologies to help us adapt to the changing climate."

A middle-aged couple is wanted to join a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. If the plans of a multi-millionaire named Dennis Tito are successful, this will be the first Martian astronauts. The spacecraft will travel about 160 km above Mars. It will use the gravity of Mars to return to Earth without burning any fuel. The goal is to save fuel, as fuel efficiency is a priority. The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again is in 2031. There is a lot of work to do before then, but the efforts to achieve this ambitious goal will not be in vain.

Aesthetics is a theory that deals with the understanding and insight of art. However, the existence of art products has become an obstacle to theory about them. This is because these products exist externally and physically, and they often become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.
In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.
The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events."

Lions are social animals that live in groups. They hunt for food together and work towards a common goal. However, lions are not always successful in their hunts. Sometimes, they are too generous and their companions benefit at their expense.

But finally, some answers are beginning to emerge.

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. In Britain, it meant that a lot of people lost their jobs and homes. Every single business in the country was affected. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, there has also been a rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The fact is that while this recession naturally caused potential clients to review, reconsider and often cut their budgets at the time, it also made them examine more closely than ever before the economics of advertising. And, generally, in the absence of concrete, convincing and quantitative evidence to the contrary, they had to conclude that the benefits of advertising might be questionable."

I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of cooking. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world.

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed thanks to capitalism. Fashion has a long history, and it has become more complex and significant as societies have developed and technology has improved. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people. Some writers earn money by writing articles and books, while others earn money by teaching or doing other jobs. Some writers are lucky enough to get a job offer from a chocolate factory, but most writers have to find other ways to make ends meet.

Music has a significant impact on our lives. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is used in many different ways, including national events, individual activities, and education. It can also have a positive impact on our well-being. Playing an instrument can improve cognitive skills, social relationships, and concentration. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can help to develop transferable skills such as study habits and punctuality. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the long term, there is likely to be a shift in focus and an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. To prepare for the future, the music profession needs to change. This includes providing more opportunities for people to learn to play a range of instruments, training musicians to be able to motivate, inspire and teach learners of all ages, and raising the profile of music itself."

The craft of acting can be seen as a form of expression that involves both imitation and evocation. Actors often find themselves compelled to talk about their craft in interviews, which can lead to disdain and contempt. However, there are some actors who have a more nuanced approach to the craft. One such actor is Adrian Lester, who has been praised for his ability to convey emotion and passion through his performance. Lester's portrayal of the character Horatio in Hamlet is a prime example of his talent. The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the audience can hear, see, and feel what's going on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are important. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage."

Paul Simon and other youngsters in the US in the 1950s listened to a new and invigorating type of music called rock and roll.

Alan Freed's show was required listening for a whole generation of fledgling rock idols. Paul Simon was one of these idols. He was fascinated by the sounds pouring from Freed's show and prepared himself for the next big step in his rock and roll obsession, which was to make his own music.
Snow and ice can be dangerous. I was walking on snow and ice when I slipped and fell into a hole.

Qualitative Research
There are many books that talk about qualitative research. But they often don't explain the processes and procedures associated with data analysis. So, researchers often have to figure things out on their own. To help with this, we invited a range of social scientists to discuss the approaches that they used. The goal was to share insight and understanding of the process of qualitative data analysis rather than to produce a guidebook for the intending researcher.

Poetry writing is like playing a game. You need to be spontaneous and creative, but also be aware of the risks. If you want to write poetry, you should read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination and spirit flow. You can write to a schedule or wait for inspiration to strike. The most important thing is to find your own rhythm and voice.
In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or long narratives. Keep your story concise and focused. Use flashbacks sparingly and only if they are necessary. Dialogue is more effective than long explanations. Keep your writing simple and direct.
Screenplay writing is also like playing a game. The more you practice, the better you become. You need to be able to see the big picture and the patterns in the play. The more you play, the more aware you become of the complexities of the game.

I have never started a book with more worry. If I call it a book, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a few stories to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals. I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I could fill the gaps in my story, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in my story. I have also made sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Oral History, Animal Science, Social Sciences, Classical Architecture
These are four topics that are being discussed in this text. Each topic has its own unique set of challenges and considerations.
**Oral History:**
The main problem with relying on oral evidence is that it is not always accurate. People's memories can be contaminated by what they have learned from other sources, or they may be influenced by their own feelings and attitudes.
**Animal Science:**
There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Each approach has its own set of challenges and considerations.
**Social Sciences:**
The main problem facing students who are studying a social science for the first time is that they must learn two things simultaneously - the substance of the subject and the methodology.
**Classical Architecture:**
Classical architecture is more than just the construction of buildings. It is an art form that emphasizes aesthetics over function."

The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career. There was a trail of smoke just before the horizon met the sea in a thin line. There was a ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. 'Do you see the ship, Son?' he asked softly. 'It is a special little ship for people like us, Son.'"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often criticize art for being too flashy or not traditional. We also expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.
There is a new artist who is doing things differently. He chooses a piece of text and writes it on a canvas. He does not use any flashy or charming lettering. The finished product is a painting.
The artist's new show is about the London Underground. He has painted pictures of the tunnels and stations. The paintings are beautiful and expressive. They convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit."

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which was only afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The house was not suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.

The roses in my neighbor's garden are a reminder that the gardens were loved once. I usually stay inside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying. I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the subject matter. They also need to be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy.
However, reviewing is not a primary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough."

Ralph unlocked his flat door and entered the dark hall. He felt a sense of ownership when he returned home alone at the end of the day. His flat had been waiting for him, and he was grateful that it was still intact. He had grown impatient with its inability to be transformed. There was a puddle of letters and a red eye of the answering machine that sometimes gathered by the door. He would often read or listen to music as the night deepened outside.
Ralph often looked forward to his three or four solitary evenings at home each week. He would crave isolation, but the relief of escape drained him and he would wait for some sense of selfhood to return.

There are some activities that take a long time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy."

My school French is not very good, but I can just communicate. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless. There is no problem for me in this, but there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Every summer, we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition that has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map and also from place to place. To understand early maps, it is essential to understand the particular convention employed. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of maps. It has called in other sciences to its aid.

Language is a powerful tool that humans have. We can use language to communicate with each other, to express ourselves, and to describe our surroundings. It is such an important part of our lives that it is difficult to imagine life without it. When there is no one to talk to, people often talk to themselves or to their pets.
Climate and weather are also important parts of our lives. They can affect our health, our ability to travel, and our ability to grow plants. Climate can be a powerful force on the character of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates can support the growth of tropical jungles, which are home to a wide variety of plants and animals. Conversely, cold and windy climates can only support a sparse selection of living things.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can find insects by tapping the surface of the wood and listening for reverberations. When searching for food, the aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.

I planted trees in New Zealand. I had a lot of winters there. My parents bought a small plot of land which we could look after. I started planting in 1968 and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres. It rained a lot that year. I enjoyed hard physical work and it made me fit. The trees are now 20 years old and in good fettle.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around.
The cubs were playful and would chase each other's tails. I also saw odder badgers in our field. We built a sett for the badgers to move into. The cubs finally moved into their new home. Now, I see the cubs only occasionally, but they still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.

In the past, there was a scientist named Sir Edmund Halley who lived in the 17th century. He is known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley was one of only two men in the land at that time who were paid to conduct scientific research. He set sail for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time. He traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and England. From these travels, Halley published a chart that showed the variations of the compass.
Dr. Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip. He plans to retrace the route of the Paramore and make measurements that Halley made. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.
Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England and he envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews."

Peacocks that live in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. How in this competitive world, where nature is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance?
The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. The peacocks tail, by contrast, was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance.
The wrangle is still unresolved, but 200 birds at Whipsnade offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
There is a final twist to this continuing story. Fisher's Runaway mechanism shows that if females choose males with slightly better tails than the rest, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails."

The best boat design combines old and new. Tom Cunliffe says that. He designed his own boat, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has a lot of new technology, but it also has some traditional features. It is a beautiful boat, and it is very seaworthy.

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes.
Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that most differences between humans and animals now appear to be only matters of degree. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.
There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale.
There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialize in them. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life.
Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The team was composed of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese, 30 camels and six camel handlers.

Three theories about sleep. People spend a third of their lives asleep. It seems certain that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. There seem to be three main theories. The most popular theory states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. A second theory emphasizes the learning benefits of sleep. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day, and asserts that, without sleep, learning would not take place. A third theory is based on ideas about energy, saying that we need periods of sleep in order to recharge our batteries and have an adequate supply of energy for the coming day.

Someone who behaves in a way that is different from the majority of people is called eccentric. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. It is the desire to be unique and to do things differently from others. Most of us have our own quirks and oddities. It may be a passion for doing something that is not common to others, a compulsion for collecting things that are unique, or a tendency to express ourselves in a way that is different from the norm. Eccentricity is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be a source of strength and creativity. However, if someone's eccentricity becomes too extreme or if it interferes with their ability to function normally, it can be a problem."

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played on a board, but much of modern chess is played off the board. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire."

Volunteer tourism is a topic that is discussed by four academic writers. They say that while volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, they usually have to pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. If the money that is paid by volunteers is donated to a local community directly, it could potentially pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.
Volunteer tourism can also lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, widespread and democratic participation in global affairs, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.
At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities."

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. So, we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available models.
The 'dual alarm function' does not allow you to be woken by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends.
The radio has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.
The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this one appealed to Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'."

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The number of spines a hedgehog has affects its ability to defend itself. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so.

It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie.

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been making weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but they are still admired for their artistry.
There has been a recent revival in blacksmithing. This is due to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.

Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.
A good leader is one who inspires, motivates, and encourages others. To be a good leader, you need to be able to speak clearly and articulately, have confidence in your abilities, and be able to inspire others. You also need to be able to set goals and achieve them.

Second, learn how to delegate and motivate others, organise and chastise, praise and raise. Third, keep working on your communication skills. Finally, remember that leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes."

Films on video are a popular way to enjoy movies. There are many different types of films available on video, including action, comedy, drama, and horror. Some of the most popular films on video include A Abyss Long Before Titanic, The Thin Red Line, On Guard, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
These films are all very different from each other. A Abyss Long Before Titanic is a Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. The Thin Red Line is a war movie about the battle for Guadalcanal. On Guard is a swashbuckler movie about a group of musketeers. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a spaghetti western about the post-Civil War West.
Each film has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. A Abyss Long Before Titanic has impressive production design and special effects, but the dialogue and characterisation are creaky. The Thin Red Line has a mystical and poetic approach, but it lacks moments. On Guard has a lot of action and excitement, but the story is corny. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has excellent sound editing and Morricone's magnificent music, but the storytelling is relentless and cruel.
Overall, there are many different types of films available on video. Each film has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. However, there is a film for everyone to enjoy."

Tim Pozzi, a 34-year-old, decided to go backpacking this summer. He was inspired by others who had taken the plunge and felt that it was time for him to do the same. He was nervous about leaving his job and his routine, but he knew that he had to do it.
There are many reasons why people choose to travel in their late twenties and thirties. Some people want to have a final fling before settling down, while others want to temper their approach to life and get rid of their old habits. Still others want to reassess their lives and take a step back to think about their future.
There are also a number of factors that make it easier for people to travel in their late twenties and thirties. The workforce is more flexible today, and there are more people working on short-term contracts. Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies.
Whether you're young or old, there are many benefits to travelling. It can be a chance to learn new things, meet new people, and experience new cultures. It can also be a chance to take a break from your routine and reflect on your life."

The computer has helped me in many ways. I used to work at a desk that was always a mess, and I was always losing scraps of paper containing vital bits of information. Now, I have a computer that helps me to be more organized. Spreadsheets help me to keep track of my income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads have saved me a lot of time and effort. I also use the Internet to research stories, ask for further information, and discuss the pros and cons of working from home with people from all over the world.
However, there are also some challenges associated with working from home. You can be in isolation from physical human contact, and there are the distractions of putting urgent jobs about the house first. But, there are also a growing number of people who have recently bought multi-media PCs, not just for the educational, leisure and entertainment facilities.

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Newspapers are facing a decline in sales, but their websites are going ever higher. The latest print circulation figures show that sales are plummeting, but the websites of The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and many of the rest are up. The decline in sales is due to a number of factors, including timing, demography, geography and more. However, the latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. Books are also facing a decline in sales, but e-readers are booming. The best way to attract a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package."

People are the most interesting subjects for photographs. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take good pictures of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.
To improve your pictures of people, you can follow these tips:
* Group people in different ways to create interest.
* Help people relax and pose naturally.
* Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
* Use eye contact or gestures to connect with the viewer.
* Show expressions and emotions through gestures and facial expressions.
* Use the background to add interest and information about the subject.
* Include interaction between people in your pictures.
* Take pictures of people in their environment to show where they were.
* Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting in your picture.
* Decide whether you want to pose or not pose the subject."

In the workplace, emotional intelligence (EQ) is becoming increasingly important. It is the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. EQ comprises basic elements such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.
More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging EQ skills is a valuable component of management philosophy. If you have strong EQ skills, you are more likely to be successful in your job and in every part of the world.
There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, EQ is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job."

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although it is easier to capture newsworthy events with digital cameras and camera phones, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that a significant number of people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most attention.
Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.
To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles inserted into the skin. They may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians.
Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.
It is important to note that acupuncture is not a substitute for medical treatment. If you are experiencing pain, you should consult with a doctor to see if acupuncture might be right for you."

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
Handwriting can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form 'threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.
It takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately. To be able to use graphology effectively, you also need empathy and intuition. More research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing."

I was in a snow cave below the summit when I started talking to my feet. The cold was getting into my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite.
B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)
This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. We followed a new route and spent a lot of time on the ridge.
C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)
We got lost in the dense jungles and ran out of water. We found a rock pool and spent the night there.
D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
The original route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges.
E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
When I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality.
F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)
We walked to the refuge and crossed open slopes. We reached what we thought was the summit, but there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit.
G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and also made a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable and spread it to Europe. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented and the age of the chocolate bar began.

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying to wonderful locations or appearing on the covers of magazines, she is usually revising for her school exams. One day, the receptionist at the agency told Jane Laidlaw that Kira would be late. Jane was trying to convince herself that all the bad things she had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into her head. When Kira arrived, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic. She was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. Kira explained that all models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. Now, Kira has to manage her two separate lives. She has a lot of friends and teachers who are proud of her success, but there are also a few unkind people at her school who are rude about her success. However, Kira is not letting her success get her down. She is confident and has a bright future ahead of her."

Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, travelled from Canada to Africa to find gold. They have a mine on the side of a Welsh mountain that could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they are convinced that they are close to a five million dollar vein of gold.
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read about pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. Since they started digging, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.
Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000 into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
The dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to gather samples of rock and water, and then three hours to get back up to the surface.
When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves.

I was dirty, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was tired of foreign timetables, currencies and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel freely throughout Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not there, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days. Sometimes, the airline may not be able to find your luggage, and you may be forced to wear unsuitable clothes in a different climate zone.
The baggage system can fail for many reasons. Sometimes, there are extra security checks at airports or problems with air traffic. There can also be human error or an accident in which the destination label is torn off. These problems can become severe at large transfer airports. Last year, for example, London's Heathrow airport handled more than 41 million passengers, of whom nine million were changing planes.
If your luggage goes missing, you should contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport."

The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It feeds on fish. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream. He missed lessons, becoming what he describes as an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only member of its cosmopolitan family to breed in Europe, was getting noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

A child who shows outstanding musical ability may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. Specialist music schools in Britain provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen to develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend a significant amount of time on musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which concentrates on the essential subjects.

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

On the rails, five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.
Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.
Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. The journey itself was lovely and the dress she wore on the train was a gift from her husband.
Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. The train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes he had ever seen.
Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life."

He came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. I understood why he didn't. He was probably busy.

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.
The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins also suffer from pollution and other substances found in the sea. One example is pesticides. These poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.
Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand."

Getting fit is important for your mind, body and spirit. It's a great way to stay healthy and maintain a perfect balance. There are many reasons why you should exercise. It improves muscle tone and strength, helps you to maintain good posture, and prevents injuries. It also helps to ease depression and tiredness, regulate sleep patterns, and control stress. If you're not sure what type of exercise is best for you, you should consult your doctor. To improve your posture, you need to stretch regularly. Stretching helps you to improve flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If you stretch four or five times a week, you'll definitely see the benefits. The best exercise involves a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout and definitely a cool down period."

Young shoppers at the supermarket often make a lot of demands. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often have a lot of trouble managing their children's shopping demands. They feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. And they get cross and defensive in anticipation as they leave home.
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. A lot of money is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate.
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. They refuse to buy their children the sweets they want on the grounds that it's bad for them while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves.

Ice skating has a long history. People have been skating for thousands of years. In the past, people used skates made from animal bone. Nowadays, skating is both graceful and physically demanding. To skate, you need to be relaxed and have good balance and control. You also need to know how to fall safely. If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. There are different styles of skating, but the basic figures can be learned with proper guidance. Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation and movement. It also improves heart and lung activity and generally strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness."

More and more people are being born who are very tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors used to eat a wide variety of foods, but today we mostly eat three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people. However, the fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled.

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. But to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. When I left home to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.
The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.
Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to let people look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.
The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.
The drawings are an important part of history and must be preserved for future generations. If we do not take steps to protect them, they will be lost forever."

Young shoppers at the supermarket often make a lot of demands. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often have a lot of trouble managing their children's shopping demands. They feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. And they get cross and defensive in anticipation as they leave home.
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. A lot of money is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate.
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. They refuse to buy their children the sweets they want on the grounds that it's bad for them while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves.
Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas."

Going up the wall was a popular activity in the past. Now, climbers can have a challenging climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath when climbers are high above them on the climbing wall. The climbing wall is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also shares at least one feature with the World Cup Climbing Championships - The Wall. The development of new technology has made it possible to build climbing walls that are similar to the ones found in nature. Before, climbers had to practice their skills on cliffs or use brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out'. Now, climbers can use interchangeable fixtures to add new holds to any existing wall."

Chris Greener was tall when he was fourteen. He is the tallest man in Britain today. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. More and more people are being born who are very tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors used to eat a wide variety of foods, but today we mostly eat three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people. However, the fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, pictures of individuals in the public eye are taken without their consent and published on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do pictures of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. However, there are also some concerns about taking on this role. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. It should show evidence of serious career planning and extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.
If you are thinking of travelling, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system and are not likely to go off again.

Parents pay a fee for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency."

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These lines make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This technique is very useful for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. They were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. Each week after that, a new part of the hotel is completed until the hotel is finished. The finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Guests can wear warm clothes and socks inside the hotel, but they need to bring their own sweaters and scarves. If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the website. You can also order equipment and book your visit at the same time. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ice hotel."

The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What was really unbelievable was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop.

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people thought that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed. The main reason for its failure was that it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

No Title When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, I wanted to earn enough to feed my children. Today 'The Body Shop' is a company that is growing all around the world. In the years since we began, I have learned a lot. Much of what I have learned will be found in this book. I believe that we, as a company, have something worth saying about how to run a successful business without giving up what we really believe in. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. Now this book sends my ideas out into the world, makes them public. I hope you do, too."

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. There are more than three hundred varieties of honey. The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Honey is good for you. It prevents tiredness and improves athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products.

The Albuquerque Balloon Festival is an annual event that takes place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the United States. It is held every autumn and celebrates the local radio station's anniversary. There were a few hot-air balloons at the first festival, and it has grown a lot since then. This year, there will be a thousand balloons from all over the world.
You can see the balloons glowing in the sky at night. To see the 'glows,' you need to arrive just after night has fallen or before 5.30 am. You can also walk around among the balloons and chat to the pilots.
There are plenty of other attractions at the festival, including balloon races and firework displays. If you want to take a balloon ride, you can arrange it in advance. You can also take the cable car to the top of the mountains and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the festival.

Each building has a different climate zone, where visitors can learn about the relationship between people and plants. Many products that we use every day come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee and chocolate. The Eden Project has a lot of different plants, over 135,000. However cold the weather is outside, the buildings have heaters to keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always damp because of a big waterfall. There are also plans to build a desert zone in the future."

The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six, says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. It's the time when you are learning about the world. Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years.

Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. Their new CD is called 'Here again'. There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year. The band is no longer going to concentrate on slow songs. The first song on the CD is a dance tune. The second song is also a dance tune. Most later songs are in the bands more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. They could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has rented in the band having to cancel their next tour."

San Francisco is a city in northern California, USA. It is located on the coast. In the past, there was a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola who discovered the area in 1769. The bay is a beautiful natural harbour. People arrived in San Francisco in large numbers in 1849 hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco because there are many famous places to see, such as Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many people also take a boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories.

No Title. I injured my back and had to take a break from running. I decided to start a running group for women in my area because I was frustrated by the lack of women in the sport. I put up posters and many women joined. They were all attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress."

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. In the winter, there was no way to get to the towns by boat or plane. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.

But many people still go there annually to visit what is probably Europe's most unusual accommodation. In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made of ice. You can also get married in one. The bar is also made of ice. Putting hot drinks on it is not recommended. The bedrooms are very cold, but fortunately guests are provided with special sleeping bags that will keep them warm in the coldest of temperatures. Suitable outdoor clothes can also be supplied, if needed. The hotel is never more than six months old because it melts in summer, and each winter it is rebuilt. Creating the hotel takes a lot of ice and snow.

But then, the team they beat complained. The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realized that she was fast. He talked to Maria about athletics and bought her running shoes and took her training. It was hard work and Maria's legs really ached. But Jose visited her parents and persuaded them she could be successful. They agreed to let him take her away to train. In 1991, Maria finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family. Today, Maria still runs and lives happily in South Africa with her mother."

It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 meters. It is a platform whose walls and floor are made of glass so that you can see the beautiful rocks of the canyon. Up to 120 people are allowed to stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007 and since then thousands of people have used it. You have to wear special covers over your shoes to avoid scratching the glass beneath your feet.

The Rocky Mountains run across North America. They start in the northwest and lie a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are still wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, a city that is very attractive. Standing with its feet in the water and its head in the mountains, this city allows its residents to ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city centre. There are three passenger trains a week that leave Vancouver on the cross-continent railway. The ride is still a great adventure. You sleep on board, which is fun, but travel through some of the best scenery at night.

Most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everybody agrees with zoos. Some people think that zoos are a good idea because they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals. Others disapprove of zoos because they believe it is wrong to put animals in cages.

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! Each band had their own costumes. We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language.

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Sometimes, the rain falls heavily and the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods. But, as many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are called oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.

For one group of children, Saturdays are a time to learn how to cook. Their lessons are popular and there is a waiting list of children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"

Winter driving is dangerous because it's difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents happen easily. Fog can be waiting for you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hidden beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly, pay attention to what might happen and allow extra stopping distance. If you drive smoothly, you can avoid spilling your hot coffee. If you pay attention to what might happen, you can avoid accidents. And if you allow extra stopping distance, you can avoid hitting the brakes too hard and losing control of your car.

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art and became interested in early Italian artists. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished."

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. We were not sure about the idea at first because of the noise. But Ben argued that it was better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, we gave in. We said, 'All right,' but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.
Because drums are not easy to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.
I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are, but one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."

The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education."

I was bored with my job as a secretary. I was unhappy and felt depressed. I was jealous of the students at the university. Now that I'm a student, I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. But I am glad of this opportunity to study. I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job. I prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. I also have the normal student benefits of long holidays and discounts. I often have doubts about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this late date has been a wise choice."

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he began working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After he had driven it a long way, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T'. It was a simple car that sold for $825. Ford's early cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.
