In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people should pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste.

When a town in Virginia started charging households for rubbish disposal, the number of bags or cans decreased significantly. However, this was largely due to the 'Seattle stomp', a dance that resulted in people stuffing more rubbish into each container. The weight of rubbish collected also fell, but not by much. Some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay to have their rubbish removed.

In conclusion, charging households for their rubbish is a good idea, but the effects of such a policy are often complex and difficult to predict.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be able to work well with others.

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

The metaphor of broadcasting as sowing seeds is a good one because it is related to the way that television is used. Television is a two-way form of communication that is used to spread words and pictures. It is also a centralised medium, which means that it is controlled by a single source.

In the early days of television, there were a lot of experiments with different ways to organise the technology. However, the most successful organisation was the one that allowed for centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience. This is because it was the most practical way to use the technology.

As a result of the widespread use of broadcasting technology, people were able to achieve improved standards of living and enter 'consumer' society. They were also able to experience a wide range of cultural experiences.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of things doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where you start to buy too much stuff. Advertising can make you feel insecure. If you don't have something that the advertising tells you you need, you will be less than other people. There are a lot of messages that tell you to buy, buy, buy. These messages can be very persuasive. They can make you want to buy things that you don't need.

Meteorology is the study of the weather. People have been studying the weather for a long time. They use their senses to make observations. Computers can now solve complex math problems quickly.

It's the human observations that help meteorologists to understand the weather.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. In a musical performance, there is usually a lot of music and a few people who don't understand it. Some people are impressed by the skill of the performers, while others are impressed by the beauty of the music. Theatre audiences have different expectations than music audiences. They don't understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. However, theatre audiences are still generous and demanding. They are willing to follow artists into the most unpromising spaces.<eos>"

Sand is a natural barrier that can be a nuisance. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you when you are wet. But it also pours off you when you step onto a beach towel or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet. Sand can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.

A lock and key have been used for a long time to keep people safe. They provide a sense of security and privacy. People like locks and keys because they make them feel safe. But some people don't like computerised locking systems. They prefer to use physical keys.

Every picture tells a story. Sometimes, when novels are adapted for film, the writer has to condense or delete parts of the story. This can be frustrating, but it can also be illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a scene, while still getting across the same point.

The movies can take you to another world. They can lift you out of yourself and make you feel like you are part of the story. But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is broken and you are back in your ordinary world.

If you dream of making movies, there are a lot of things you can do to make your dream come true. You can read books about scriptwriting and film production, take courses at fashionable universities, or compete in competitions. If you have the talent and the drive, you can make your dream a reality.<eos>"

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked on someone's front path. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other memories that I can't put names to. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was very lonely and had a strange way of behaving. Sometimes she would get angry and clean the house or wash her hands. Sometimes she would be very quiet and listen to the radio. I remember my mother taking me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. Here, hand-in-hand, we would look at paintings. My mother wasn't altogether averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. When we see someone else crying, we often feel sympathy and want to help them. Another reason is that crying can help us to express our emotions. When we are sad, we often cry to let others know that we are unhappy. Finally, crying can also be a reflex response to certain stimuli, such as hearing music or watching a movie.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather and the planet. The changes are already happening and they are having a big impact on plants, animals, water and soils.

The main cause of the warming is human activity. We have been burning fossil fuels, which are releasing gases into the atmosphere. These gases are trapping heat and causing the Earth to get warmer.

The changes to the climate are having a lot of negative effects on the planet. For example, the sea level is rising, glaciers are melting, and extreme weather events are becoming more common. These changes are having a big impact on people and animals.

It is important to understand the causes and effects of climate change so that we can take steps to reduce its impact. We need to reduce our use of fossil fuels and find ways to adapt to the changing climate.<eos>"

Art is a special form of experience that can be enjoyed in many different ways. It can be enjoyed through the senses, such as seeing and hearing, or through the mind, such as thinking and feeling. When we talk about art, we often think of paintings, sculptures, and other objects that are displayed in museums and galleries. However, this is not the only way to enjoy art. Art can also be enjoyed in many other ways, such as through movies, music, and even everyday experiences.

In order to understand art, we need to be able to connect it to our own experiences. When we look at a painting or listen to music, we should try to imagine how it makes us feel. We should also think about how the art is related to our own experiences. If we can do this, we will be able to enjoy art more fully.<eos>"

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s were probably the toughest of your professional life. The economy was bad, and there was a lot of competition for jobs. Many people lost their jobs, and businesses struggled. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as the ones who are responsible for supporting the company's bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, there has also been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now more likely to make sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want, rather than what it is convenient for them to provide. This has increased the status of marketing people, but also added to their burden.

There are a number of factors that have made it difficult to produce effective advertising. These include the economic situation, the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take risks. There is also the problem of changing consumer needs and desires, and the rise of sponsorship. All of these factors have made it difficult for companies to increase the proportion of advertising that works.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Reading and travel can help us to escape the deadening effect of habit. When we read a great book, our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place.

Music has become an integral part of our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a significant increase in the opportunities to listen to music through various technologies such as radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and the internet. However, there has also been a decline in the performance of live music and the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. Despite these challenges, music continues to fulfill many human needs and is often used in national events and individual activities.

Playing an instrument can have many benefits, including improving cognitive skills, social relationships and concentration. There is also evidence that playing music can help develop transferable skills such as punctuality and organization. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.

In the future, there are likely to be some changes in the way music is enjoyed and made. New genres of music will emerge and technology will be used more to compose and perform music. This will widen access to music but also reduce the need for live performance. As a result, there will be an increase in the number of people who wish to actively participate in music making.

To ensure that the benefits of music education are available to everyone, there are a number of things that need to be done. These include changing the focus of instrumental tuition, training musicians to be more effective teachers and motivators, and raising the profile of music itself. By working together, those involved in the music profession can create a more inclusive and rewarding music education experience for all.<eos>"

The craft of acting can be challenging and rewarding. Sometimes, actors are criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to deliver a convincing performance. However, there are also many actors who are passionate about their craft and work hard to deliver a memorable performance.

Another important aspect of acting is the ability to create character. When an actor is able to bring a character to life, it can make the audience feel like they are part of the story.

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the theatre creates a relationship between the performer and the audience.

Writing poetry is like playing a game. You need to be spontaneous and creative, but also be aware of the risks. If you try to be too perfect, you might make a mess of things. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination. You also need to be open to new ideas. Some people need to feel secure before they can write, while others can write their way out of misery. There are different ways to write poetry, but the most important thing is to find your own style. Once you have found your style, you can start writing.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or long narratives. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story. Dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realize. It can reveal two sides of a question in less time than explaining it from only one person's viewpoint. Overwriting can kill a short story, but this doesn't mean that brevity must reduce it to the level of a synopsis. To write a screenplay, you need to know the basics of chess.

I have also made sure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess.

They would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had learned to drive. They made plans to go on a journey together.

They decided to leave early in the morning and return by midday. They drove to the English Channel. Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to admit that Lily had done a good job. They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was worried about the road markings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

The journey was over the horizon and the ship was gone. Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. Today, we often praise artists for being unique and revolutionary. But sometimes we also criticize them for going too far. We expect artists to be different from the rest of us. We want them to have special talents and drive.

In the past, artists were often commissioned to create art for specific purposes. Today, we leave artists to their own devices. We get cross if they want to come down out of the clouds.

There is a new trend in art today. Artists are choosing to paint pictures of the world of the London Underground. This is a popular trend because it is unique and different.

I am a painter. I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I speak of the uselessness of art but add nothing truthful about its consolations. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side.<eos>"

Simon Costello knew that buying the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession that was only affordable if you exercised extreme economy. At the time, it had seemed like a good move. He had had a lot of successful cases and they were coming in with regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.

There were some things that could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. She never said it without a sense that even speaking the words subtly diminished her standing, socially and economically.

The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.

The encounter had been as instinctive as an arm raised to ward off a blow and had sounded unconvincing even to his own ears. His whole action had been one of guilt.<eos>"

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the need to be able to write clearly and concisely. The reviewer also needs to know quite a bit about the book or article they are reviewing. If a reviewer can do all of these things well, they can write a review that is both informative and entertaining.<eos>"

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed very quickly, while others take much longer. Some can be speeded up, but others cannot. If you try to rush a task, it will probably break down.

There are also different ways to think. Some people think quickly and make decisions right away. Others think more slowly and carefully. There is a type of thinking that is called 'intellect'. It involves figuring out problems and making decisions. Another type of thinking is called 'creativity'. It involves coming up with new ideas and solutions.

The mind can also work in a slower, more contemplative way. This is called 'meditation'. Meditation can help you to relax and focus on the present moment. It can also help you to solve problems and come up with new ideas.<eos>"

Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past few decades. In the past, there were not many charts and catalogues, and telescopic equipment was limited. Today, there are many more charts and telescopes available. Computers have made it easier to produce charts and analyze observations. All this makes it a good time for amateur astronomy.

However, there has also been a loss of things. Now, you may have to travel a long way to find a sky that is comparable to the sky found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can last for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Society is also becoming more complex. There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. This can be stressful and make it difficult to focus on one thing. As a result, there is a new trend emerging. People are looking for ways to simplify their lives. This is called 'simplexity'.

I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days.<eos>"

Othello The transfer of a production of Shakespeare's play Othello to London from Stratford allows me to make amends for an unfair review I wrote last spring. I complained that the actor Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role, but I think it's a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona. However, I appreciate Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. The whole cast is magnificent. There are some memorable scenes in the play, such as the one where Cassio's games get out of hand and the moment when Iago loses control. The pace and tension throughout the play are terrific.

Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. Birds have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people used to read the directions in which wrens flew to determine their luck. Today, the image of the wren is still in pictures and ceramics in many British households.

Birds are also important to us because they are indicators of environmental change. Conservationists in Britain cite the endangering of 30 species, which is a big loss of cultural heritage.

Folklore is important because it can help us to understand and appreciate birds. Stories, legends and rhymes about birds can evoke feelings and attitudes from a consciousness buried under all the stuff of modern life.

Whether we watch wildlife films on TV or birdtables in the backyard, what we see and the excitement we get from it cannot adequately be captured by scientific reason.

A map is used to show the relationships between points and features on the Earth's surface. It is determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but this gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than the actual distance. Direction is also an important element of a map, but for the ordinary traveller, it was not the most important thing. Written itineraries used to be popular for a long time, but maps are still used today. Certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may not be very accurate. Landmarks along a route were sometimes indicated by signs. The history of cartography is the history of the increase in accuracy and comprehensiveness of maps.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop.

Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.

The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are other birds that also probe for or glean insects from wood. So, the woodpecker niche may not be vacant.<eos>"

I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond.

I have been a father for many years. I have made some mistakes, but I have always tried to be there for my children. If they need me, I'm here. I'm always on the basis that they ring me.

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.<eos>"

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have been looking after orphaned animals ever since. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. Inside, there were three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. They usually spend their early life underground and if orphaned, die of starvation.

The cubs were cold and whimpering. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. I fed them every four hours and they soon started to progress. After a few weeks, they were eating cereals and other food.

One day, I noticed that one of the cubs, Willow, was not doing well. He was lethargic and not eating. I took him to the vets but it was too late. He died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken. But fate works in strange ways. A few days later, I found another male cub, Willow II, who had been abandoned by his mother. I took him in and he joined the other cubs.

The cubs are now eating a variety of food and are very happy. They go for walks at night and play with each other. I am glad that I was able to help them.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was very useful for sailors for many years.

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He is fascinated by Halley's accomplishments and plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip. He wants to retrace Halley's route and make more precise measurements of declination. The data collected from this expedition will help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He said that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert.

The peacocks tail is not necessarily advantageous. Darwin felt that it was a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance. He argued that females like 'beauty for beauty's sake'. But his friend and collaborator, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He felt that the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.

Now, 100 years later, the wrangle is still unresolved. But the peacocks at Whipsnade offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. What separates humans from animals is a very recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a few of our genes.

Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that most differences between humans and animals now appear to be only matters of degree. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.

There are some similarities between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Book reviews play an important role in the success of books. Publishers and authors have different perspectives on reviews. Publishers rely on reviews to attract readers and generate sales. They often prefer positive reviews, as they believe that they can increase sales. Authors, on the other hand, are devastated by no reviews. They need reviews to promote their books and build their careers.

Reviews can have a significant impact on book sales. A good review can launch a book and a career, but it is not the only factor that contributes to sales. Other factors include word-of-mouth recommendations, the book trade, and marketing.

The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is complex. It is different from the relationship in the United States. In Britain, reviews are not as widely read as in the United States. It sometimes takes a long time for a book to gain popularity, even if it has received positive reviews.<eos>"

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

Volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and participation in global affairs. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative or self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organisations they work for, as well as provide opportunities for cross-cultural exchange and learning.

Volunteer tourism can also be seen as a way to help others. However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of volunteer tourism, such as bypassing democratic processes and perpetuating inequalities.<eos>"

The training camp is basic, but the athletes have everything they need to train. They live in cinder-block dormitories and have three work-outs each day. The daily regime begins at six and includes a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon.

When the day's running is over, the athletes have a simple life. They eat a healthy diet, take a bath in the stream, and relax.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could.

There are many different types of blacksmithing. Some blacksmiths make gates and balconies. Others make bookends and sculptures. Still others make jewelry and tools. No other metal can give man as much visual pleasure or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good.<eos>"

I stopped smoking a few months ago. It was a difficult decision, but I knew I had to do it. I had been smoking for many years and I was addicted. I had tried to quit before, but I had always failed. This time, I was determined to succeed.

The stop-smoking session was a group therapy and hypnotherapy session. It took place two months and three weeks ago. I did not intend to stop smoking, but I was persuaded to try. I was told to smoke as much as I wanted, but I found that I was not able to smoke as much as I thought I would.

I am glad that I stopped smoking. I have not regretted it. I have more energy and I am able to concentrate better. I also have a healthier family. I am still coming to the view that smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom. However, I am not perfect. I still smoke sometimes, but I am working hard to quit.<eos>"

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born in southern Sweden and has a unique talent for playing the trumpet. His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers, but new works too.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. He had a natural talent for playing the trumpet and was taught by Bo Nilsson, a second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra.

Hardenberger has a unique gift of communicating through his music. He is able to make people feel happy and sad, excited and relaxed. He is a true artist and his music is always moving.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to be mindful of the presence of the camera.

When photographing groups of people, avoid straight lines and arrange people at different angles and distances. For posing individuals, help them relax and find a comfortable position. To make a picture more engaging, consider eye contact, expressions and gestures. You can also use the background to add interest and information about the subject.

If you are photographing two or more people interacting, look for opportunities to capture the interaction between them. You can also photograph people against a relevant background. To show people against a background, use a standard or wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building or mountain in the frame.

A good picture will show a balance between the subjects and the place they were visiting. To capture a good picture, consider the following tips: avoid straight lines, arrange people at different angles and distances, help them relax and find a comfortable position, consider eye contact, expressions and gestures, use the background to add interest and information, and capture the interaction between subjects.<eos>"

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most popular.

Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become sick.

Acupuncturists use a variety of techniques to find out where the imbalances occur in the energy flow. They may examine your tongue, feel your pulses on your wrist, or assess your general appearance. Once they have found the imbalances, they will use needles to stimulate the flow of energy.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.

If you are considering trying acupuncture, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your health concerns with your doctor before making any decisions.<eos>"

The pen is more powerful than a psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a science that can reveal a person's character and health. If you apply for a job in some countries, you will probably be asked to write a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting will be used to determine your suitability for the job.

Graphology can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. It can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.

However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain skeptical about the value of graphology. They say that handwriting is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

Film critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. It was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided they should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lacking in self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but they didn't get together as planned. So everything was done by phone. Mark chose film as his area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, they would hardly have come up with the present arrangement.<eos>"

They collect stones, seashells, flowers, paintings and other things. I have been collecting all my life. I have collected everything from flowers to pottery and paintings. My first collection was of stones picked up in my parents' garden. I was fascinated by these objects. I am not alone in being interested in collecting objects. One in three adults indulges the same passion. There are many reasons why people collect. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing. You do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. You can collect items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. As small objects become a popular collector's item, they begin to rise in price.<eos>"

No title. We always go to Ireland in June. Every year, the four of us have spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds bought the house and have added to it. They have done everything discreetly. We've been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland.

In the morning, we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.<eos>"

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Last March, Donna Laney lost her job and decided to go to Career Analysts for help. She was advised to take a year off and work in the Far East or to move into something more suited to her skills. Donna decided to use the skills she already had and move into something more suited to her than insurance. She is now working as a Public Relations officer.

If you are feeling stuck in your job and need some guidance, a visit to a careers adviser might be the right thing for you. However, it is important to remember that careers advice doesn't work for everyone. You have to provide the adviser with a lot of personal information and you may not be told anything that you don't already know.<eos>"

I was dirty, smelly, and hungry. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more. I was tired of foreign timetables, currencies, and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel all over Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.<eos>"

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not there, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage, even the best ones. It is impossible to guarantee that your luggage will go on the same flight, especially when there is a change of aircraft.

The system for baggage handling is designed to work well, but it can sometimes fail. Extra security checks and problems with air traffic can cause delayed flights. Human error and accidents can also cause problems. If your luggage is lost, you should contact the airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR).<eos>"

It has a powerful image that lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He has a deep feeling for this little bird. He can't identify just what it is that draws him to it. The kingfisher is the stuff of legend. There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue. The kingfisher is a popular bird to photograph. It is easy to watch from a hideout.

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not able to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a lot of musical ability, they may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.

There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find the necessary fees. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. Finally, it can be stressful to be a musically gifted child. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common types of dolphin. Bottlenoses are social creatures that live in groups. They are often seen near to European coasts.

One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are removed from an area, dolphins may not be able to find enough food to survive. Human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.

Dolphins are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to regulate the food chain and they are a source of joy for people all over the world. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive.<eos>"

Kendra's team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but she knows that the Championships will be tough. She says that you have to push yourself to play each day and that you can still win an international series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.

Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra says that it is essential that all players think and train like world-class players. As captain, she thinks it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example.<eos>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

The dive can last for 16 hours. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released. It's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two thirds of her salary comes from teaching. She loves teaching, but she does it so she can get on with her research.

The only time Rachel has been frightened is when she first went down with the Americans. There was an explosion and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" But she was still alive.

It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the underwater volcanoes, there is such a sense of wonder.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our actual words.

Mary Pearce was studying to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job. The Head Teacher said that if someone doesn't take the time to present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?

It is important to have a professional image and to communicate clearly. If you want to do well in an interview, you should dress professionally, make good eye contact, and speak clearly and concisely. You should also be prepared to answer questions and show that you are interested in the company.<eos>"

Chris Greener was tall when he was fourteen, and he is still the tallest man in Britain today. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors used to eat a wide variety of foods, but today we mostly eat three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

However, there are some problems with this trend. The world has not moved on. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.<eos>"

Studio audiences are a common feature of television life. They are made up of people from all classes, professions and income groups. People often go to studio audiences to appear on television, take a look behind the scenes, or simply have fun.

When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.

Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.<eos>"

It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and the enjoyment of the contents.

I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mom when I was young. My mom always insisted that I write my own thank-you letters. When I left home to train as a doctor, I would write to my mom once a week. Sometimes my dad would write too. I also had penfriends from all over the world.

I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. It's better to have a year's supply of news than just a few notes. And it's even better when the letter comes in an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site but charge a fee.

The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there. If we do not take steps, the drawings will be lost for future generations.<eos>"

Once upon a time, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, there is a climber named Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators. But it also has another thing in common with the World Cup Climbing Championships - The Wall. The Wall is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. But as the sport developed, it became more important for top climbers to keep fit. So, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls were made of bricks with special edges that climbers could hold on to. But they had some problems. They could only be built in a vertical plane, and they were not very comfortable to climb. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a new material that made it easier for climbers to hold on. This material could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination.<eos>"

Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often show private moments of celebrities and other people in the public eye. Sometimes, these pictures can be very damaging to the people who are pictured. However, very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is an organization that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The PCC rarely investigates complaints about pictures that are not in the public interest. If the PCC decided to take on the role of 'police officer', there would be several problems. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry, and celebrities and members of royalty might be upset if their stories were taken up. Additionally, the role would be too enormous and embarrassing for the PCC to handle.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grass and they are found in every place on the earth. Grasslands support a lot of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals can live together in one place. As soon as they have eaten all the grass, a new supply of grass is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over PS500,000. Her clothes appear in fashion magazines, she designs for pop stars and she has just gained public recognition by winning this award. Her business has come a long way and she knows she is extremely lucky.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train travels across the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known mostly for being late. There was a new line completed a few months before Mark's journey. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. Mark's journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken him to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The weather can be very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. You need spikes for your boots on Ben Nevis because the snow is very hard. There was a lot of safety equipment, including lights, hats, and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when they set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The track was steep and the legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, Keith had to rest more frequently. After a long climb, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. Keith was glad he had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when he was safe in the tent that he could say he really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

My new school is a very exciting place. It's made of wood, just like my old school, but it's also one of the first schools in my country that is designed to be environmentally friendly. It took a long time to build, so I saw all of it happening. There are five classrooms in the school, which are big. We share one room with people from the town when they need it. There's also a nursery, a dining room, and changing rooms. The school is well designed, so it holds all the heat and sound inside. If we sing inside our classrooms, it sounds like we're in a concert hall. The roof of the school has a tree on top of it. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday. It's so big, it can be seen for miles. We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it.

Last month, I was hanging 30 meters above the ground. It was a lot of fun. I looked down at the river below me and I understood why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not very nice, but we had everything we needed. We were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, I met the other members of our group. There were ten of us altogether. We came from different places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was difficult, but after a lot of effort, we were out at last. We were covered in mud, but we were pleased and excited by what we'd done.<eos>"

When I realized that I had done that, it was too late. I didn't know what to do. I was 72 years old and I was a long way from home. I was also quite worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

Last Thursday, a new furniture shop called Homestyle opened for the first time. Many people rushed to the shop to buy furniture. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa and a bed. The shop was very busy and had to be closed soon after opening.

The main problem was that there was a lot of people waiting in line to get into the shop. The queue was very long and people were not patient. They became angry and refused to queue quietly. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop. This meant that the road was completely blocked.

One customer, Jenny Smith, said that she queued for three hours but didn't have time to buy what she wanted. However, she said that the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. So she'll come back when the shop reopens but she's not willing to queue again.<eos>"

The first song on the CD is a dance tune, and the second song is also a dance tune. The rest of the songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. They are excellent songs and could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford does a great job singing all the notes perfectly. Fans should be grateful that he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has unfortunately caused the band to cancel their next tour.

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people went to Alaska hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the winter months, it was difficult to get to the towns because the rivers and the ocean froze. So, in 1910, a track was built that would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat.

Nowadays, there is a dog sled race held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

My name is Katie and I am 14 years old. I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools. Our band won! Each band had its own costumes. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch.

I have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. Only about half of the people who want to play get accepted. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language.

Jazz is a really exciting music. It's both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time.<eos>"

Simplified Text: 'Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Sometimes, the rain falls heavily and the water pipes can't handle it. But, as many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is always welcomed by the local people. The city's parks and gardens exist because of a network of underground channels that bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are called oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is divided into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, which are snow-covered in winter, provide a beautiful background. '<eos>"

For a group of children between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are a time to learn the art of cooking. They have weekly lessons in small classes that are very popular. There is a long waiting list of children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Winter driving is dangerous because it is difficult to see what is going to happen and accidents happen easily. The road can be icy and slippery. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen. You should also allow extra space for stopping. If you are driving too fast, you may not be able to stop in time. If you stay in control of your car at all times, you will avoid trouble.<eos>"

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but he still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists and the Italian fields. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. He painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. But he doesn't know what the results will be. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. We were not sure at first, but we eventually agreed. We said, ""All right, but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.""

Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their instruments. They practice for several hours a week, and the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their singing.

Ben's hobby has been good for our health. Whenever the band starts practising, my husband and I go for a walk. I admit that their music may sound a little strange, but they are friendly and polite young men.

Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet. I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.<eos>"

Last week, I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It's a very good place where young people can learn and gain experience. The students, who are between 16 and 18 years old, come from all over the world. They spend their mornings studying and their afternoons doing activities like helping on the farm, taking care of people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the best things about Atlantic College is that it has students from many different countries. As few people can afford to pay the high fees, grants are available. Many students are British and they receive government help to attend the college. ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like."" To sum up, Atlantic College is a great place where young people can learn and gain experience.<eos>"

I was also feeling depressed because I felt stuck in my job. I was jealous of the students at the university, who looked happy and carefree. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. They always mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel separated from the lecturers because, although we are the same age, I know so much less than them.

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she climbed the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. Life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink. When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are not very common because families are usually at home at that time. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also ask your neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when you are away. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

In the past, people used to go to the forest to find food. They had to move around a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and their villages grew bigger. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

Hi Anna,

I'm not having a very good week. Yesterday, my team lost a volleyball match. The other team played much better than we did. My friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called me with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he has a summer job. We can't go camping together now. This morning, my sister got up late and rode my bike to school. She didn't tell me she needed to use it. I'm really angry with her. I hope you have some good news. Write back to me today if you can.

Madame Tussaud's museum is a popular place for tourists in London. People can see figures of famous people made of wax. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, a doctor, made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. Marie helped him in his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. Here she had to copy the heads of famous people when they were dead, including Queen Marie Antoinette's. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud and in 1802 she came to London with her wax figures. Here she opened a museum and her figures can still be seen today.<eos>"

The bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. It was invented a long time ago. In the past, bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could afford to buy one. The early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought one. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles. But some people still prefer to cycle to work. They say that there are too many cars in town centres and you can't find anywhere to park.<eos>"

Simplified text: Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family. We went to a park and saw an elephant show. There were three elephants and their keepers. The elephants started to paint pictures on their own cards. I was surprised to see what they drew. One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest, but now they don't. The cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.<eos>"

There are different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they don't look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. They can be very long, up to 3.7 meters. Most cats don't like water, but tigers will sometimes lie in a pool of water when it is hot. Lions are the only cats that live in large family groups. They work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. All cats need good eyes to catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast and strong.<eos>"

Simplified text: 'The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. It can be very heavy, sometimes more than 90 kilos. Most ostriches live in Africa. There are not very many of them left. Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour. It is very difficult for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water. '<eos>"

Victoria, a young woman from Britain, started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her recently at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked her why she started the sport. ""I like all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed like a natural thing to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.""

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. ""In the winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We asked her what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!""<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are different ways to climb Kilimanjaro. The Marangu path is the easiest way. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Not everyone who tries to climb Kilimanjaro reaches the top. This is because the weather can change quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature can be below freezing. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.<eos>"

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. Otters can close their ears and nose. This means they can stay under water for several minutes. In the past, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for them. But today, the rivers are clean again and there is lots of food for them.<eos>"

Simplified text: 'People have always built buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We also use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass. '

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"
