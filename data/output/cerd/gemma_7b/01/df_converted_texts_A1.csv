In many places, rubbish is collected from households at regular intervals. It is taken away to a local tip, where it is disposed of. In most places, this service is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish that is produced, people would have to buy less of just about everything.

If you charge households for the rubbish they produce, people will produce less rubbish. But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to enjoy your work, even if you have a high-paying job.

There are a few things you can do to make your work more fulfilling. First, you need to find a job that you are passionate about. Second, you need to be able to communicate effectively with your colleagues and clients. Third, you need to be able to be creative and problem-solving. Finally, you need to be able to work well with others.

If you are able to do all of these things, you will be more likely to be successful and satisfied with your work.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that is used to spread seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

Television is a technology that is related to various two-way forms of communication. From its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

In the early 1930s, there were a lot of experiments with different forms of organisation. But Big Business agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out.

Television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s. And as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry.

As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of things doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where you start to buy too much stuff. Advertising can make you feel bad about yourself if you don't have everything that everyone else has. There are a lot of messages that tell you that if you don't have one of these things, you are not a good person. To see how much you are influenced, try not to read any advertising billboards the next time you go down the street.

Caves are interesting places that people have studied for a long time. They are a natural part of the environment and they make us curious. Scientists have spent a lot of time studying caves.

Meteorology is the study of the weather. People have been studying the weather for centuries. Today, we have advanced tools to help us understand the weather.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. In a musical performance, there is usually a lot of music and not much acting. The music can be very impressive, and it can also be very emotional. Sometimes, the music can even be life-changing. Theatre audiences have different expectations than music audiences. They don't understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. However, theatre audiences are still generous and demanding. They are willing to follow artists into the most unpromising spaces.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Sometimes, when novels are adapted for film, the writer has to condense or delete parts of the story. This can be frustrating, but it can also be illuminating.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked on someone's front path. Most of my early life I have forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other memories that I can't put names to. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was very lonely and had a strange way of behaving. Sometimes she would get angry and clean the house or wash her hands. Sometimes she would be very quiet and listen to the radio. I remember my mother taking me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. Here, hand-in-hand, we would look at paintings. My mother wasn't altogether averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. When we see someone else crying, we often feel sympathy and want to help them. Another reason is that crying can help us to express our emotions. When we are sad, we often cry to let others know that we are unhappy. Finally, crying can also be a reflex response to certain stimuli, such as hearing music or watching a movie.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather and the planet. The changes are already happening and they are having a big impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not know exactly how the world will change. We do know that human action has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases are causing the Earth's atmosphere to trap heat, which is making the planet warmer. The warmer temperatures are causing changes to the weather, such as more heatwaves, floods and droughts.

The changes to the weather are also affecting the geographical locations of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands. This is causing problems for food production, water resources and human settlements. The effects of climate change are already being felt in many parts of the world and they are likely to become even more severe in the future.<eos>"

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s were probably the toughest of your professional life. There was a recession in business that was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. In Britain, it meant that a lot of people lost their jobs and homes. Every single business in the country was affected. Some businesses found themselves down by 30%. A lot of people and companies suffered. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as the ones who are spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, there is also a paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The idea that companies should be making sure they are producing services and goods that their customers want, as opposed to merely what it is convenient for them to provide, is not new. But it's not unfair to say that it has been only over the past ten or fifteen years that many companies seem to have put the idea intentionally, rather than fortuitously, into practice. The consequences have been that marketing activities have at last begun to be given the attention they deserve by management, that these people have acquired a little learning about the subject, and that a few brands have actually begun to be genuinely marketed.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Reading and travel can help us to escape the deadening effect of habit. When we read a great book, it guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. Today, we often praise artists for being unique and revolutionary. But sometimes we also get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be different from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

In the past, artists were often commissioned to create art for specific purposes. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get cross if they want to come down out of the clouds.

There is a new artist named Eric Rimmington who is doing something different. He is painting the London Underground. His new show is called Underground Encounters. It has 40 paintings and drawings that convey the curious magic of this sunken world.

Art can be a very calming and soothing experience. It can help us to relax and forget about our troubles. It can also help us to express ourselves and to connect with others.<eos>"

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the need to be able to write clearly and concisely. The reviewer also needs to know quite a bit about the book or article they are reviewing. If a reviewer can do all of these things well, they can write a review that is both informative and entertaining.<eos>"

Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past fifty years. In the past, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there are many telescopes and equipment that you can buy. Computers have made it easier to make almanacs and charts. They have also made it easier to analyze observations and publish results. All this makes it a good time to be an amateur astronomer.

However, there has also been a loss of things. Now you have to travel farther to find a sky that is comparable to the sky in urban areas fifty years ago. The daytime skies are now filled with aircraft condensation trails which can last for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

The new economy has also brought a lot of changes. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. This can be stressful and make it difficult to focus on one thing. As a result, there is a new trend. People are looking for ways to simplify their lives. This is called 'simplexity'.

We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting.

To find food, the aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward. It can probably hear the rustle of insects and the reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below.

One day, I noticed that one of the cubs was not doing well. It was lethargic and not eating. I took the cub to the vet, but it was too late. The cub died from a lung infection. I was sad, but I continued to rear the other two cubs.

A few days later, I found another cub. It was abandoned by its mother and was cold and hungry. I took the cub into the farmhouse kitchen and installed it beside the stove for warmth. The cub was fed every four hours and grew quickly.

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was very useful for sailors for many years.

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He is fascinated by Halley's accomplishments and plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip. He wants to retrace Halley's route and make more precise measurements of declination. He also hopes that his measurements will help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They have evolved such an obvious extravagance in a competitive world. The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are trying to settle the matter of how peacocks have evolved such an obvious extravagance. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He said that the fittest individuals are the most likely to survive and reproduce. But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert. The peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance. Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'. The females like the showiest males. The cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates. But whether the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. What separates humans from animals is a very recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a few of our genes.

Art is not only used for communication but also for aesthetic pleasure. Humans have a unique ability to learn and transmit art through learning rather than by genes. This is different from animals. Birdsong serves the obvious functions of defending a territory or wooing a mate, and thereby transmitting genes.

Most human art is not utilitarian. It is produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction. Like the ape paintings, human art serves no narrow utilitarian functions.<eos>"

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can be a rewarding experience for individuals and communities. However, it is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of this type of volunteering.

One of the main concerns is the financial aspect. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labor than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

Another concern is the potential for volunteer tourism to be exploitative or self-serving. If volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

Despite these concerns, volunteer tourism can also have some positive benefits. It can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. It can also raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.<eos>"

However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I am because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money.""

C. Annabel is a rower. She says, ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level.""

D. Ffyona is a long-distance walker. She says, ""At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he thought that photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting were scientific proof that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that they were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images. It is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

In the past, blacksmiths were very important because they made weapons, armour and farming tools. Today, blacksmiths make decorative items, such as gates, balconies and candlesticks.

There has been a recent revival of blacksmithing. This is because there is greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. blacksmiths can now use power tools to bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal more easily.

Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work. To be a good leader, you need to inspire, be an agent of change, and show the way forward. It's not about being tall or intelligent. To convey enthusiasm and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak clearly and with conviction. You also need to be able to set goals and achieve them. To become a leader, you need to recognise your latent talents, develop them, and use them. You can benefit from improving your leadership skills, regardless of your position. To be a good leader, you need to be able to delegate, motivate, organise, and chastise. You also need to be visible and accessible to those who are important. But remember, you don't have to lead all the time.<eos>"

I'm 34 years old and I'm nervous about backpacking. I quit my job and rented out my flat to go travelling in South East Asia for a year. I'm excited about this trip, but I'm also worried about making the arrangements and organizing everything. I'm also concerned about feeling out of place among the younger backpackers.

There are a lot of reasons why people are backpacking in their late twenties and thirties. Some people want to have a final fling before settling down, while others want to temper their approach to life and get rid of their old habits. Some people also want to reassess their lives and see what they want to do next.

If you're not happy doing what you're doing, it's no longer a question of just seeing it through. Now people are aware that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" any more. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to take a step back and think about your life.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to be mindful of the presence of the camera.

When photographing groups of people, avoid straight lines and arrange people at different angles and distances. If possible, have some of the group sitting or kneeling at the front so that you can see all the faces. To pose people for pictures, relax them and help them find a comfortable position. You might suggest they fold their hands or put them in their pockets.

When taking pictures of people, try to make eye contact with the subject or have them concentrate on something within the picture area. Expressions and gestures tell us more about the subject of a photograph than anything else. Look for familiar expressions for your portraits: shrugs, winks, anger, tears, thumbs-up, fist-clenching and so on.

To show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building (or mountain, or lake) in the frame. If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be far easier to do.<eos>"

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most popular.

Acupuncture points are located along meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.

To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin at specific points on the meridians. They may also use warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on the meridians.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to relieve pain during surgery.

If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you.<eos>"

The pen is more powerful than a psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a science that can reveal a person's character and health. If you apply for a job in some countries, you will probably be asked to write a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting will be used to determine your suitability for the job.

Graphology can also be used to predict illnesses and psychological states. It can show if you have heart disease, cancer, or psychological problems. It can also be used to assess your personality and potential.

However, there is little evidence to support the claims made about graphology. Some psychiatrists say that handwriting is not a reliable indicator of a person's character or health.<eos>"

The dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to gather samples, and then three hours to get back up to the surface. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released.

Last year, Rachel dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes.

It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder.<eos>"

I was dirty, smelly, and hungry. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more. I was tired of foreign timetables, currencies, and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket was cheap and allowed me to travel all over Europe. I slept in the corridor of the train and carried all my possessions on my back. It was a basic way to travel, but it was also a lot of fun. I didn't see much culture, but I did have a good time. I was with my friends and we had a lot of fun. We shared food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that you have never seen before. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.<eos>"

There is nothing more sad than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not there, you will have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage. It is a fact of life that sometimes regular travellers will lose their luggage. The system at airports is designed to help prevent luggage loss, but it can still happen. If your luggage is lost, you should contact the airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR).<eos>"

If a child has a special musical ability, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not even notice their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not able to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a lot of musical ability, they may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.

There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find the necessary fees. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. Finally, it can be stressful to be a musically gifted child. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.<eos>"

If you want to get your story published, there are a few things you need to know. First, you need to research your market and find out about publishers. You also need to practice your writing skills. To become a successful writer, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. You can do this by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. You should also join a local writers' group or take a creative writing course.

Once you have written your story, you need to submit it to publishers. However, it is unlikely that your work will be published right away. You need to be patient and keep writing. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. If you want to improve your writing skills, you should write more stories. Each one will be better than the last. You should also get feedback from other writers and editors.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common kinds of dolphin. Bottlenoses are social animals that live in groups. They are often seen near to European coasts.

One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are removed from an area, dolphins may not be able to find enough food. Finally, human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.

Dolphins are an important part of the ocean ecosystem. They help to regulate the food chain and they are a source of joy for people all over the world. It is important to protect dolphins from the threats they face.<eos>"

Young shoppers at the supermarket can be a challenge for parents. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often feel guilty about buying and feeding their children rubbish. They also get cross and defensive when they say no to their children's demands.

Research has found that children make a purchase request every two minutes when they are taken to the supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy. But these ideas are not always accurate.

Parents also admit they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Sometimes they refuse to buy sweets for their children while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves. It's hard to be consistent.

We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. They also killed animals. Today, most people eat a diet that is based on three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize. This diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. However, there is a trend in Europe, the US, and Japan that is changing this. In these countries, people are eating a diet that is more like the diet of our ancestors. As a result, the average man in these countries is now taller than the average man in the world. However, there are some problems with this trend.

But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site but charge a fee.

The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there. If we do not take steps, the drawings will be lost for future generations.<eos>"

Young shoppers at the supermarket can be a challenge for parents. They want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often feel guilty about buying and feeding their children rubbish. They also get cross and defensive when they say no to their children's demands.

Research has found that children make a purchase request every two minutes when they are taken to the supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy. But these ideas are not always accurate.

Parents also admit they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Sometimes they refuse to buy sweets for their children while they are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for themselves. It's hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas.<eos>"

Once upon a time, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, there is a climber named Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators. But it also has a climbing wall. The climbing wall is made of bricks with special edges that climbers can hold on to. Many sports centres started building climbing walls like this one. They use bricks with special edges to make it easier for climbers to hold on. You can climb on the wall all year round, but it can get tiring after a while.<eos>"

Chris Greener was tall when he was young. He is the tallest man in Britain. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. They also killed animals. Today, most people eat a diet that is based on three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize. This diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. However, there is a trend in Europe, the US, and Japan that is changing this. In these countries, people are eating a diet that is more like the diet of our ancestors. As a result, the average man in these countries is now taller than the average man in the world. However, there are some problems with this trend. For example, clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products. And the world has not moved on. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860.<eos>"

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They have a childhood game that is very popular. It's called pichenotte. They play it on a wooden board with round plastic pieces. Their grandfather brought the game into the USA and introduced it to his family. The family played the game every weekend and holiday.

One day, Dave decided to make a new game board. It was a beautiful board. People started to ask about the game and Dave decided to do some research. He found out that pichenotte is a game of skill. It's played by two to four people. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. The pucks are flicked across the board using the middle or index finger of one hand. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses made a few more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. People loved the game and started to buy them. Championships began to take place and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. The game is popular and the Lagasses are making a lot of money. They are happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune.<eos>"

Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often show private moments of celebrities. Sometimes, this can cause a lot of damage to people. But very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is an organization that can deal with issues of this kind. Usually, pictures in the newspapers are not in the public interest. They are mostly about celebrities and their private lives. If the PCC decided to take on the role of 'police officer', there would be several problems. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry. And if the person involved still refused to do anything, the PCC might still proceed. However, there are also some concerns about the PCC taking on this role. It would be embarrassing for someone to have their privacy invaded and then have to go through an investigation. And it would also be difficult to monitor the whole of the British press.<eos>"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious career planning. Most important, it should extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.

If you are thinking of travelling, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system, and are not likely to go off again.<eos>"

The lessons are popular, and there is a long waiting list of children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn new skills. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora, twelve, is having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grass and they live in every part of the earth. Grasslands support a lot of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them need grass in one way or another. Grass grows very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals can live together in one place. When all the grass is eaten, new grass grows quickly and there is always enough food for everyone.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train travels across the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known mostly for being late. There was a new line completed a few months before Mark's journey. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. Mark's journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken him to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

New ideas and computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. In the past, cartoons were only for children. But now, there are some new ideas that are making cartoons fun for adults and children. Not every cartoon film is successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again. '<eos>"

Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years.<eos>"

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold found in Alaska, USA. Many people came to the area to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the winter, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a track was built that would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail.

The Iditarod Trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead.<eos>"

It was exciting to watch. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school. We often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time.

Winter driving is dangerous because it is difficult to see what is going to happen and accidents happen easily. It can be foggy over the hills. There might be ice hidden under the snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly. If you make uneven movements, the car can become difficult to control. So, every time you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or increase your speed, you should be gentle and slow as possible. Imagine you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. You should also pay attention to what might happen. If there is a lot of ice on the road, you have to look further down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember that you may be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will avoid trouble.<eos>"

Aitchison says that anyone can do the colours. You can buy them. He simply notices what you put the colours next to. He changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them.<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are not very common because families are usually at home at that time. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday.

In the past, people used to go to the forest to find food. They had to move around a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and their villages grew bigger. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels a long way from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Nicola Peet left school at eighteen and went to college. After that, she worked at a local airport. After nine months, she started working for a big airline. She has been working as a manager for four years. This is what she told us about her job: 'My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend most of my time flying. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems. I also go to lots of meetings. My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses. Sometimes I go on long flights to check how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favourite part of the job, but I also like office work. Travelling can be hard work. When I get back from a long journey, all I can do is eat something and then go to bed! I don't earn much money, but I'm happy with my job and want to stay there and continue to travel.<eos>"

They go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories. They also have singing and dancing. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years.

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

Simplified text: 'Dinosaurs were very long ago. No one has ever seen a dinosaur. They lived a long time before people lived on the earth. Nobody knows why they all died. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were many different kinds of dinosaurs. Some were small, but others were big. The biggest dinosaurs were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was very long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.<eos>"

The bear is a strong animal. It is very strong and can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and running very fast. But they cannot see well. Like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are different kinds of bear. The largest is the white polar bear. There are two kinds of black bear. One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is difficult to find food.<eos>"

The Globe Theatre was a long time ago in London. It was different from a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. You can still visit the Globe Theatre today. There is a new theatre there where you can see a play or learn about life in the seventeenth century.<eos>"

Dear Jeff,

I'm having a good time on holiday in Australia. The weather was bad when we arrived two weeks ago, but now it's better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were different there too: red, yellow, and purple. Australia is a beautiful country. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
