In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish people produce, the marginal cost of disposing of their waste should be charged. This will give people an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their careers. To be successful in today's world, you need to be more than just skilled. You also need to be able to communicate effectively, be open-minded, and be able to build relationships.

There are a lot of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you love and that allows you to use your skills and talents. Another is to be able to work in a supportive and collaborative environment. If you are able to find a job that meets all of your needs, you will be more likely to be successful and happy in your career.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

The metaphor of broadcasting as sowing seeds is appropriate because it is related to the way that television is used to spread information and entertainment. It is also related to the way that television is used to bring people together.

In the early days of television, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to want to have a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you're not as good as others. There are a lot of messages that tell us to buy, buy, buy.

Caves are a small part of the natural environment that have been studied for a long time. They are mysterious and interesting, so people have invested a lot of research time in them.

Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere. Countless people started meteorology by observing the weather with their senses.

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences for audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily a form of theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music takes precedence in opera. The music is the heart of the performance, and it is what makes the event so captivating.

At a musical performance, there are usually people like me who have little technical or academic understanding of music. We may be aware of how much we don't know, but we are also awestruck by the skill of the performers. The skill of an opera singer or a musician is impressive, and it takes years of hard work to achieve such mastery.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't necessarily understand the nature of an actor's skill or are not particularly impressed by long and difficult speeches. However, this doesn't mean that theatre audiences are less generous or demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall. Many theatre audiences are the same people who attend music performances.

There are some things that could be done to improve the relationship between music and theatre. For example, music audiences could be more patient and allow the performers to complete their work without interrupting with applause. Theatre audiences could be more willing to try new and unconventional performance spaces.

I believe that music and theatre can thrive together, and I want more and more people to experience the joy of being an audience to both art forms.<eos>"

Sand is a natural barrier that can be a nuisance. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you when you are wet. However, it also pours off you when you step onto a beach towel or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet. Sand can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.

A lock and key have been used for many years to keep people safe. They provide a sense of security and privacy. However, some people don't like computerised locking systems.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original text were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs.

Watching movies can be a very immersive experience. It can lift you out of yourself and transport you to a world where you are not beholden to ordinary reality. But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is broken and you are back in your ordinary world. You do not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents you from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in your boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'.

The studio where I worked was a complex place. It was difficult to find your way around. There were many different buildings and rooms. It lacked a focus.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting, or perhaps balancing, at any rate precariously, on some vantage point near an upstairs window, and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. As a child, I had a sense of the oddity of her personality. She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate. As a moral code, this was completely beyond my comprehension. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked; it meant - oh, a hundred proscriptions and prohibitions.<eos>"

I live on Philadelphia Avenue, on the odd-numbered side. The evening was dark, and the air was thick with rain. I knew this side of the street well. There are many houses on my street, and I used to play with my friends there. The houses are all different, like the little troughs in the cement that lead water away from the roof gutters. As I walked down the street, I noticed that the porches were lower and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, there have been changes to the houses. The wooden porch banisters and pillars have been replaced by wrought iron. The old stores have become homes again. I also noticed that the houses are not always used in the way they were intended. For example, a flat that was once a curtain warehouse is now a designer's office. The designer wanted to have a space where he could work and live, but he also wanted to make sure that the space was private. He broke up the space near the entrance with a giant snaking sheet of corrugated plastic. The swimming pool is a great place to relax and enjoy the rain. I like to swim in the pool when it is raining. The best moments are when the storm intensifies and the rain falls hard. Swimming is a subversive activity because it allows us to regain a sense of what is old and wild.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness. They can also help us to express our emotions and to connect with others on a deeper level.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. They are also having a big impact on human societies.

One of the biggest problems is that we do not know exactly how much the world will change. We do know that human action has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause the Earth to warm. The increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are already affecting global climate.

Another problem is that climate change is causing extreme weather events to become more frequent. This is causing problems such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts.

The changes to climate are also having a big impact on ecosystems. For example, changes in climate are causing forests and grasslands to move to new locations. This is having a negative impact on the plants and animals that live in these ecosystems.

The changes to climate are also having a big impact on human societies. For example, changes in climate are causing food shortages and water shortages. They are also making it more difficult to build and maintain infrastructure.

The changes to climate are a serious problem. We need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.<eos>"

Art is a powerful form of human expression that involves the creation and appreciation of aesthetic objects. These objects exist physically and are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they are housed. However, the very perfection of some of these products and their prestige can sometimes get in the way of understanding them. When artistic objects are separated from their original context and operation, they become isolated and difficult to relate to. To understand art, we need to forget it for a time and turn aside from it to have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. In order to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw, in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear, arousing one's interest and affording enjoyment as one looks and listens.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Reading and travel can help us to escape the deadening effect of habit. When we read a great book, our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Through reading and travel, we find new perspectives and insights.

Music is important for a number of reasons. It can provide opportunities for learning and development, both vocational and social. Playing an instrument can help to develop skills such as concentration, punctuality and organization. It can also be a source of enjoyment and relaxation.

There is a growing demand for instrumental teaching. As a result, the focus of instrumental tuition will need to change.

The craft of acting can be challenging and rewarding. Sometimes, actors are criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to deliver a convincing performance. However, there are also many actors who are passionate about their craft and work hard to deliver a memorable performance.

When an actor is able to connect with the audience on an emotional level, it can make the performance more powerful and engaging. Another important aspect of acting is the ability to create character. When an actor is able to bring a character to life, it can make the performance more believable and relatable.

For example, if you write about your personal life on a blog, someone could read it and use that information against you.

But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.

Photography has been used to record human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well, but I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in this story. I have also taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers. I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports.

Poetry recitals are a popular way to share poetry. There are two main types of poetry recitals: those that are intended to be printed and read on the page, and those that are intended to be performed live. The poets who write for the page often use complex language and imagery. The poets who perform live often use simpler language and imagery. However, both types of poets need to be able to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively. Poetry recitals can be a valuable way to learn about poetry. They can also be a source of enjoyment.<eos>"

Oral History

The act of relying on oral evidence for historical purposes has its challenges. It is not always accurate to assume that someone's testimony accurately reflects their past experiences. In an interview, both parties are influenced by each other. The historian chooses the informant and decides what to talk about. Even if they do not ask any questions and simply listen, the presence of an outsider changes the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. The historian's social position and their own way of analyzing the past can also affect the end product. To be a good historian, one must accept responsibility for their part in creating new evidence.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to studying animals - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body works, while those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it. Within the 'whole animal' approach, there is a distinction between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists work in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, while ethologists study the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap, the two approaches are distinct.

The Social Sciences

When you first study a social science, you have to learn two things at once - the substance of the subject and the methodology. This means becoming familiar with the knowledge and research findings in the textbooks, as well as the methods used to obtain and organize that knowledge. The two elements are closely related. Although social life is familiar to everyone, each social science discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, uses particular methods of study, and employs its own set of concepts.

Classical Architecture

Classical architecture was much more than just the construction of buildings in Ancient Greece and Rome. It was an art form that emphasized aesthetics over function. Vitruvius, a Roman architect, defined architecture as 'Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution.' These concepts were derived from earlier Greek authority. Though the temples may appear ornate, they are essentially simple, single-roomed huts.<eos>"

They decided to go on a journey together. They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. They left early in the morning and returned by midday. Lily drove impeccably. She overtook a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve. Chen went as far as applauding.

They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. Anyone could write a review and post it on the site. This made it easy for people to see what others thought of a book. The reviews were not always accurate or fair, but they did provide a good overall indication of whether or not a book was worth reading.

The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com were serious and well-written. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying. However, there were some issues with the reviews. For example, some people wrote fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people wrote reviews that were too biased or not objective.

Art in modern times, has become more and more popular over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we sometimes feel that the artist has gone too far. We often say that what he does can no longer be called art. This is because we expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

Here is a situation: An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book. He then asks someone to make a canvas for him, stretch it and prime it. He then asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. The finished product is a painting.

The artist's new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground. The sketches have provided the material for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings which convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.<eos>"

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.<eos>"

Students of detective stories have explained the flourishing of this genre as an expression of the conflicts of late nineteenth and early twentieth century society. The detective story is essentially an allegory. The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society.<eos>"

Air-conditioning is used a lot at Cannons Gym, a popular lunch-time spot for workers in the City of London. The air-conditioning is so strong that the gym feels like a cold place, like the Arctic, at quiet times. Air-conditioning is a common thing in the modern world. It is used for work and play, and it is a symbol of human ability to control the climate. Many air-conditioned buildings could use other methods of cooling. They could use daylight and natural ventilation, and thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and radiate it away at night. These measures would reduce the need for air-conditioning.

When Keith and Dawne went to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

When they arrived at the hotel, they were greeted by a woman who introduced herself as Mrs. Franks. She explained that they had been booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. But when they realized that they were in the wrong country, they became alarmed. They tried to explain their situation to the receptionist, but he did not understand.

Ernest Shackleton was an American executive who was inspired by the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America has only just discovered him. Now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. They are producing biographies and accounts of Shackleton's voyage, mounting a grand exhibition, and preparing a film based on his life.

Shackleton was a leader and communicator. He had his values in order and was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose. He was adaptable and willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh.

One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating. Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. He led by example and showed that everything else falls away when you are in charge.<eos>"

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate named the aye-aye. The aye-aye has a lifestyle that is similar to a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae.

The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way into the wood and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations.

The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are other birds that also probe for or glean insects from wood, so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant.<eos>"

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but few of us know what their lives were like. We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with a solution: she writes other people's autobiographies. She writes a hardback book of at least 20,000 words - with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.

The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. She writes other people's autobiographies and people enjoy doing it. The assurance of confidentiality encourages her subjects to overcome any instinct of self-censorship.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. The flight was over and the students were exhilarated.<eos>"

I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot. I like winter. My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which 'the kids', my brother, sister and I, could look after. We would always have a stake in New Zealand. We found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. It's rather poor land, but it's good for planting trees. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres. It rained a lot that year. I had a guy to work with me who was an experienced tree-planter.

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet and their eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before.

The cubs were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. I fed them every four hours and they soon began to progress. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around.

However, tragedy struck one day. One of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic and died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken. But fate took a turn for the better when a local farmer found a single male cub and brought it to me. I named him Willow II.

Willow II was a difficult cub to feed. It took me a long time to get him to eat. But eventually, he started to eat and grow. The cubs were finally weaned on to creamed rice and other foods.

As the weather got warmer, the cubs began to turn nocturnal. They would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. I would often go with them and have a lot of fun watching them play.

One day, I spotted some odder badgers in our field. They were probably looking for food. I was warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so I placed sheet metal over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.

The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers and there was a lot of interest in the story. We started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With the help of local businesses and the community, we were able to build a sett and the badgers moved in.

Now, I have a lot of fun watching the badgers play and interact. They are a joy to have around.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was used by sailors for many years.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's voyage. He hopes that his measurements will help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field. The expedition will also have scientific merit. It will involve making the measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire display their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. The peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance. Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. What separates humans from animals is a relatively recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.

Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many attributes once considered uniquely human are also used by animals. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.

There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity.

However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Book reviews play an important role in the success of books. Publishers and authors have different perspectives on reviews. Publishers rely on reviews to attract readers and generate sales. They often prefer reviews that precisely echo their own response to a book. Authors, on the other hand, are devastated by no reviews. However, they also understand that reviews can help to sell books.

The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is complex. In the United States, the New York Times can make or break a book with a single review. Here, though, the people in the bookshops often don't take much notice of them. It sometimes takes a long time for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet, some of the most dismally received books are the biggest sellers of all.

Overall, book reviews are an important part of the book publishing industry. They can help to sell books and generate sales. However, they are not the only factor that determines a book's success. Other factors include the book's content, the author's reputation, and the book's marketing.<eos>"

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labor than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

Volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and democratic participation. It can also help develop people who will act ethically in favour of those less well-off. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative and self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organizations they work for, as well as provide space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience.

Volunteer tourism can be seen as a positive way to help others, but it also raises concerns about the politics of volunteer tourism and the potential for exploitation.<eos>"

Here, we talk to just a few brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill is a skier. She says, ""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. You just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends.""

B. Caroline is a cyclist. She says, ""I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I'm because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist.""

C. Annabel is a rower. She says, ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level.""

D. Ffyona is a long-distance walker. She says, ""I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record!""

E. Lisa is a saloon car racer. She says, ""Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!""

F. Alison is a triathlete. She says, ""There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't.""<eos>"

The day I met Picasso, I was an 18-year-old student travelling around Europe and Morocco. I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront and spent much of my time drawing. One day, I met Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was a very reclusive artist, but I was lucky enough to be carrying my sketchbook and ask him for his signature. Picasso agreed to sign my sketchbook and added a flourish to the page. I was delighted and thanked him. We talked for a while, and I showed him my drawing. Picasso was impressed by my drawing and gave me a nod. He also asked me to draw his portrait. I was surprised but agreed. Picasso drew a portrait of me that was much better than my drawing. I thanked Picasso and asked him to sign the drawing. He agreed to sign it, but he said that I already had his signature. I was disappointed, but I still look back now and wonder at my good fortune. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a lot to me.<eos>"

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers like to buy fresh produce. They often place their fruit and veg at the entrance of the store or even a display of house plants for sale. They also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around the store.

Supermarkets also use other techniques to attract shoppers. They may spread low-price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores. They may also offer special promotions or discounts. Sometimes, supermarkets use giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses to attract shoppers.

If you're shopping in a supermarket, you may see video trolleys that advertise products as you shop. These trolleys have a screen that advertises products as you shop. Sensors at the end of shelves trigger relevant advertising - so the shopper passing the cook-chill cabinets, say, may receive an ad on the screen for ready-made moussaka.<eos>"

Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are known for their accomplishments in climbing and sailing. Bonnington climbed the summit of Everest in 1985, while Knox-Johnston was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handedly in 1968. They teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and their journey is documented in their book, Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979, the author was working on a book about adventure and called Knox-Johnston to ask for an interview. The author offered to show climbing techniques and Knox-Johnston showed sailing techniques. They sailed for a while and anchored. The author and Knox-Johnston climbed and paddled to the shore. The route was difficult, but the author was impressed by Knox-Johnston's steadiness.

The author felt that he was useless at times and that the crew was packed too close together. He also found it difficult taking responsibility for Knox-Johnston's life. However, they had a strong friendship and enjoyed their time together.<eos>"

Apples have been with humans since the beginning of time. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. In the past, apples were very important to people. They were used for food, medicine, and even religious ceremonies.

In the Middle Ages, there were many different kinds of apples in Britain. Some of the most famous apples from that time include the Old English Pearmain and the Costard. These apples were very popular, but they were also expensive.

In the 18th century, there were two important discoveries that changed the way people ate apples. The first discovery was made by a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt. He discovered a new apple variety called the 'Hawkey'. The second discovery was made by Maria Anne Smith. She discovered a new apple variety called the 'Granny Smith'. These two apple varieties are still popular today.

Today, apples are grown all over the world. They are used for food, medicine, and even religious ceremonies. However, there is a problem with the way apples are being grown. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all.<eos>"

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar is one of Britain's top 10,000-meter runners. He visits the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp, which is located ten miles south of the equator. The camp is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.

The athletes at the camp live in cinder-block dormitories and train hard. They have three work-outs each day, including a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon.

The daily regime begins at six in the morning. The athletes wake up, eat breakfast, and then go for a run. After running, they have a simple meal and then relax. In the evening, they bathe in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.

By the time Nerurkar left the camp, he was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. He couldn't stop himself pondering upon a rather different explanation for their success: the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, the gruelling work-outs, and the passion for success.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.

Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. However, advertising can still be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.

If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly. But the advertiser does not know exactly which people will respond. This is one of the fundamental differences between the use of media and face-to-face selling.<eos>"

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is a place that has a lot of surprises. It has a thirteenth-century chapter house called Southwell Minster, which is famous for its pagan figures of 'green' men. The house is also home to the 'autonomous house', which is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat.

The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off, there is a monastic stillness. The Vales designed the house to be low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build.<eos>"

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Throughout the ages, iron has been a powerful force in human imagination. Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen who have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. They also produced beautiful artwork, such as the ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral.

Over the past few years, there has been a revival of blacksmithing. This is due to increased interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist, and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.

The blacksmiths craft is a fascinating one. It is a combination of art and engineering. Blacksmiths are artists who use metal to create beautiful and functional pieces. Their work can be seen in homes, museums, and public spaces.<eos>"

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she raged. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I understand why she was upset. I couldn't explain how I had been a smoker for so long and how I had stopped. The stop-smoking session was a mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not particularly want to. But I did stop. The physical craving for nicotine faded after a few days. The one activity that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order. Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing. I am increasingly coming to the view that smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes.<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed of swapping lives with someone else for a day? It would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

Amanda, a young mother, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant. Amanda had never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. Being a mother is definitely a busy job. It was all a far cry from her home town and, to be honest, she wasn't sure she'd survive!

Cindy's story was also quite interesting. She spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. It was difficult to stop herself dipping her fingers into the goodies! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work.

The two stories are quite different, but they both show that swapping lives with someone else for a day can be a lot of fun.<eos>"

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born in southern Sweden and has a unique talent for playing the trumpet. His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers, but new works too.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, whom she persuaded to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson was an up-and-coming musician, and at once spotted natural talent.

Hardenberger has a gift for finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre. The boy bought all his records, and idolised him.

Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. He is a thoughtful and humble musician who is passionate about his work.<eos>"

The film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases. He reviews A Abyss Long Before Titanic, The Thin Red Line, On Guard, Character, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

A Abyss Long Before Titanic is a Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. The film has impressive production design and special effects, but the dialogue and characterisation are not as strong.

The Thin Red Line is a war movie about the battle for Guadalcanal. The film is well-made, but it is not as complex or rich as Malick's version. The flashback sequence is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus imagery.

On Guard is a swashbuckler film. It is corny but highly watchable. The film has a consummate villain and an exuberant hero.

Character is a dour tale set in turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The film has excessive production and costume design, but the storytelling is not as strong as the visuals.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a digitally re-mastered war epic. The sound editing is impressive, but the storytelling is relentless and cruel.

The Longest Day is a war epic with a lot of extras and a lot of action. However, the early sequences drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers.<eos>"

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most widely accepted in the West.

Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become sick.

Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a science that can reveal a person's character and health. It is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.

Handwriting analysis can be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.

According to Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says, 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'

Handwriting can also be used to reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether someone is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims.<eos>"

Chewing gum is a popular fashion accessory in the United States, where people chew an average of 12 million sticks a day. Gum is made from a natural resin called chicle, which is obtained from the sapodilla tree. In the past, people chewed gum made from spruce resin or mastic gum. Today, most gum is made synthetically. Gum is used to reduce tooth decay. It helps to increase salivary flow and reduce plaque acid. Gum manufacturers say that chewing gum for 20 minutes can increase your salivary flow. There are many different flavors of gum, and new textures and flavors are being developed all the time.<eos>"

Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent, the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I climbed the Seven Summits in the order I completed them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

I climbed Mt. Everest with my climbing partner, Dougal Haston. We were in a snow cave below the summit when I started talking to my feet. The cold was getting into my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

I climbed Mt. McKinley with Dougal Hatton. The air pressure in the polar regions is lower than at sea level, which has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

I climbed Kilimanjaro with Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes and ran out of water. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges instead. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

I climbed Vinson Massif with a team. We all got to the top within 8 hours, but the visibility was down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

I climbed Elbrus with a team. We crossed open slopes and reached the summit.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

I climbed Carstensz Pyramid with a team. We reached the summit by 11 am. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

The Brackham area had a lot of trees that were brought down in a terrible storm in March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had changed the appearance of the town centre. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force, was not able to notice the change because he was sick with bronchitis. He had been feeling unwell for a few days and was unable to work. When he finally went to the doctor, he was prescribed antibiotics and was able to rest at home. The loss of the walnut tree had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The room seemed cruelly bright and the worn furnishings were exposed in all their shabbiness. With the tree gone, the room was dominated by the tall house next door. It seemed to have a great many upstairs windows, all of them watching the Pelhams' every movement.<eos>"

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. And then it happened - the reservoir overflowed. The river seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.<eos>"

Film critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. It was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided they should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. The newspaper was new and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that the paper would be successful. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lack of self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of his reviews appeared, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but they didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. Mark chose film as his area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, they would hardly have come up with the present arrangement. The space he is given allows him to broaden his argument or forces him, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing.<eos>"

The hobby of collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. Many people enjoy collecting things, and one in three adults indulges in this hobby. If you enter this world, remember one thing: if you do not fall in love with an object, do not collect it.

People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Primitive man collected pebbles, and children still collect stones and seashells. You can also collect flowers, pottery, paintings, or even toys.

If you are interested in collecting, there are a few things you need to know. First, you need to find something that you are passionate about. Second, you need to be patient and persistent. Third, you need to be willing to learn from your mistakes.

Once you have found your passion, you can start collecting. You can start small, like I did, and build your collection over time. You can also start by collecting items that are inexpensive. As you become more experienced, you can start to collect more valuable items.<eos>"

Last March, Donna Laney lost her job and decided to go to Career Analysts for help. She was advised to take a year off and work in the Far East or to move into something more suited to her skills.

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a comfortable blue couch. Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist, even when they don't have any pain. To make people feel more relaxed, he has tried to create an environment that is pleasant and enjoyable.

The surgery smells like a perfume shop, not a dentist's office. There is the smell of orange today. Jerome uses a special instrument that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. He found out that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.<eos>"

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is a popular treat worldwide. It is part of a multi-million pound business. In Britain, people spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter and Christmas. The cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztecs, Toltecs and Mayans thousands of years ago. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate. The chocolate drink was first made in Aztec times and was flavored with spices. It was also used on ceremonial occasions and for welcoming visitors. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks that had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, a Dutch inventor named CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847. Today, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilized at about four bars each week.<eos>"

I took great pride in the fact that I could see the view from the station in many places. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage, even the best ones. It is impossible to guarantee that your checked luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when there is a change of aircraft.

The system for baggage handling works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a specific time before departure. This is to allow enough time for baggage to be transferred to the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are exaggerated to allow for baggage transfers. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail.

If your luggage is lost, you should contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.<eos>"

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not designed to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a strong musical ability, they may benefit from attending a specialist music school.

There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find financial assistance. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. Finally, there is the pressure to succeed. Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years, while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure.

If you are considering sending your child to a specialist music school, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully. If you think that your child would benefit from this type of education, it is important to research the schools in your area and talk to other parents who have experience with them.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

Five celebrities share their favorite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The journey is always enchanting, regardless of the weather or time of year. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous.

Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed many rail journeys through the years. He has a favorite journey that he would choose: the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. Unfortunately, he missed out on a family train journey due to his youth and troublesome nature.

Betty Cooper, a novelist, is grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. It was on the train that her husband gave her a pink dress, which she has worn ever since.

Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. The train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes he had ever seen.

Arisu Mezuki, an actress, has a different perspective on favorite railway memories. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where there were few trains. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life. She made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire and her passion for steam trains began.<eos>"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were a lot of people waiting. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples with their luggage and college kids with their bags. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He also came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. I understood why he didn't. He seemed unreliable. He swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area.

If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair.

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was to know someone who knew someone who was leaving a place. If you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

The flat was upstairs and there was a cheerful-looking girl coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.'

Jo went on climbing and met a punk named Pauline. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to.

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common types of dolphin. Bottlenoses are social creatures that live in groups. They are often seen near to European coasts.

One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are removed from an area, dolphins may not be able to find enough food to survive. Human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.

Dolphins are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to regulate the food chain and they are a source of joy for people all over the world. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive.<eos>"

You also need to be able to communicate clearly and concisely. If you speak in long, confused sentences, the interviewer will not be able to understand you.

They also worry about the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused.

Sure, here is the simplified text for an B2 learner:

It's true that people are getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. He was already tall for his age, and today he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. More and more people are being born tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors lived on a diet based on a wide variety of plants. But when agriculture was invented, our diet changed. We started to eat mostly carbohydrates, such as wheat, rice and maize. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have lived on unhealthy foods that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. But there is a welcome trend. In Europe, the US and Japan, diets are again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. However, there are some problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown. The question is: where will it all end?<eos>"

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged rapidly. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The mountain is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. People are damaging the drawings by stamping on them, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts of the drawings to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but to charge a fee or rope off the area and provide guides.<eos>"

Once upon a time, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also hosts the World Cup Climbing Championships. The fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. During the winter, they would either tolerate the cold weather or go walking instead of climbing. As the sport developed, it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. They used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls had special edges that made it easier for climbers to hold on. However, there were some design problems with these walls. They could only be built in a vertical plane, and they were not very comfortable to climb. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a new material that made it easier for climbers to hold on. This material could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination.<eos>"

To become an actor, you need to be naturally skilled and have a lot of imagination. You also need to be courageous and believe in yourself.

Acting is all about making contact with the audience. It's the moment when the actor and the audience connect. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job.

Sure, here is the simplified text for an B2 learner:

It's true that people are getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. He was already tall for his age, and today he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. More and more people are being born tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors lived on a diet based on a wide variety of plants. But when agriculture was invented, our diet changed. We started to eat mostly carbohydrates, such as wheat, rice and maize. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have lived on unhealthy foods that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. But there is a welcome trend. In Europe, the US and Japan, diets are again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. However, there are some problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown. The question is: where will it all end?<eos>"

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are playing a childhood game called pichenotte. It's a game of skill that is popular in New Mexico, USA. The game is played on a wooden board with round plastic pieces. Each competitor gets 12 pieces and flicks them across the board using their middle or index finger. The goal is to get your pieces into a small hole and score points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses started making their own boards and selling them to others. They made a lot of money and eventually decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and started turning out boards. More than 450 boards have been produced to date. They are available for $595 each from the brothers' website.<eos>"

Tabloid newspapers in Britain often publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when their private moments are captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. Rarely, if ever, are these pictures in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should look into this outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. If the PCC decided to take on this role of 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. However, even if the PCC decided to take on this role, it would be difficult to enforce it effectively.<eos>"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious career planning. Most important, it should extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.

If you are thinking of travelling, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system, and are not likely to go off again.<eos>"

A Jenny said that working at her daughter's school helped her to become more outgoing. She realized that she had to believe in herself and that working at the school was the turning point in her life.

B Michaela said that she learned to be confident by learning to manage her fears. If things get too demanding at work, she doesn't let herself feel guilty if she saves a number of tasks until the next day.

C Lisa said that she has to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. She has found that the best way to gain confidence is to tackle things that scare you.

D Barbara said that her confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work she does. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round.

E Kim said that she had to work hard to gain confidence. She found that the real secret of confidence lies in telling yourself over and over again, 'Nothing is impossible.'<eos>"

Paul Forster went to a kite-flying festival in Malaysia. He spent a nervous night in the forest. He was given a kite that was traditional and had plenty of other kites. They sat down in the shade of the trees and looked at the festival. The kites rose into the air like rockets. There was a competition with more than 500 men and boys. Each had entered four different designs.

Baba, a local, offered to take care of Paul. He stayed in a bamboo hut and drank cold tea. Night was totally black and there was a lot of noise.

What kind of shopper are you? Everyone goes shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers.

There are two main types of shoppers: addicted shoppers and reluctant shoppers. Addicted shoppers love to shop and can't resist spending money. Reluctant shoppers don't enjoy shopping and only go when they have to.

If you are an addicted shopper, you probably spend a lot of money on clothes and feel guilty when you spend too much. If you are a reluctant shopper, you probably don't enjoy shopping and don't spend much time doing it.<eos>"

For a group of children between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are a time to learn the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are very popular. There is a long waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. In time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the north to the south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', although it is known for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Tanya Streeter is a world-record-holding free-diver. Free-diving is a sport where people reach great depths on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by being the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean without any help. She had been deeper before, but this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female to break the world record.

Tanya's training schedule is very intense. She spends most of her time doing land-based training at the gym, and the rest of her time in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve the fitness of her heart, but she doesn't run because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness.

When Tanya is not training, she makes frequent public appearances to advertise sports products and to support environmental organisations. She also spends time doing research projects and making films.

Tanya is passionate about her childhood dream of living a life like this. She is well-known in some countries, so people are prepared to listen to her when she is talking about environmental issues. As for the future, Tanya says she plans to keep breaking her own world records.<eos>"

Cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages thanks to new ideas and advanced computer programs. In the 1970s, people thought that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas and made films that adults and children could enjoy. Not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake and began to make large amounts of money again.

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made mostly of water and sugars. Bees can travel a long way to produce honey. They may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit many flowers to produce just a half kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. There are many different kinds of honey. The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food. It was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. It is also used in many skin and hair-care products.<eos>"

Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years.<eos>"

Moonshine, a band, released their third CD last week. The CD is called 'Here again', which is a follow-up to their previous CD, 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee who left the band last year. The band has also welcomed a new drummer, Tom Simpson. The first song on the CD is a dance tune, which shows that the band is not going to concentrate on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the remaining songs are in the band's more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. They could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford does a great job reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful that he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has unfortunately caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as all the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.) Overall, this CD is certain to be a big hit and bring more success to this band.<eos>"

Although San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Today, San Francisco is a popular tourist destination. People come to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge.

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska, which is the most northern state in the USA. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In the winter months, there was no way to get to these towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. It took a long journey to get the medicine to Nome. But the dogs were able to complete the journey and save the people who were sick. Nowadays, there is a dog sled race held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

My name is Katie Atkins, and I'm 14 years old. I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools. Our band won! Each band had its own costumes. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch.

I have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. Only about half of the people who want to play get accepted. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot.

Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history. My school's really lucky because we have great teachers, and parents who've supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music.<eos>"

Ice might be hidden beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen. If you drive smoothly, you will be able to control your car more easily. You should also test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember that you may be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will avoid trouble.<eos>"

He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. He painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them.<eos>"

She sold this to a school where one of her friends worked. After two years, her business was very large and her parents were very pleased with her. She made all kinds of food which she sold to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to get some people to work for her.<eos>"

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has a lot of sheep and each one has enough wool for many sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was hot weather and people didn't want to buy sweaters. So, she made some socks. Everybody loved the socks because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had a lot of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are many different socks for different people and occasions. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present. On the walls of Jenny's office, there are lots of letters from happy customers all over the world.<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, usually between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders said that the number of house burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that most burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are not common because families are usually at home at that time. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To deter burglars, Inspector Saunders recommends leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

In the past, people had to travel a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people in the Middle East started to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and build bigger villages. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

After nine months, she started working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and then joined British Airways as an air hostess. Four years later, she got her present job as a manager.

I also go to lots of meetings. My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses. Sometimes I go on long flights to check how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favourite part of the job, but I like office work, too. Travelling can be hard work. When I get back from a long journey, all I can do is eat something and then go to bed!

Now there are computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day.

Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films every year. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bait on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bait. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

Dear John,

Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a very good teacher. I enjoyed my stay in Cambridge. Now I am staying at my brother's flat. He is studying to be a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go home to Greece. I like London very much. We travelled to Regent's Park by bus yesterday. It was very sunny and we had a good time. Tonight, I am going to see a film with my brother and some of his friends. I'll write again from Greece. Best wishes, Kostas.<eos>"

Dear David,

I'm writing to you to tell you that I'm going to visit your country next month. I'm going to travel with two friends. We haven't decided where to stay yet. Would you be able to give me some information about cheap hotels in your town? We would like to stay somewhere in the centre. Can you help us?

I also have some good news. My aunt Gloria has offered to let us stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house. That would be perfect for us, wouldn't it?

David, I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your name]<eos>"

People have always built buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We also use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.<eos>"

Hi Indre, I have a problem. I need your help to go shopping tomorrow. My grandmother is turning 80 next month and she is having a party on Saturday. The problem is that all my trousers are too short for me now. I need to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots. I haven't got a lot of money, but I think it will be enough. Would you like to meet me in the morning or the afternoon? Let me know. Sarika<eos>"

The towns of Sherborne and Dorchester are located in the south of England, close to each other. There are many green hills and fields between the two towns. On one of these hills, there is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. Nobody knows exactly when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think it was a long time ago. To get closer to the picture, you can walk from Cerne. If you go on the first of May when the sun comes up, you will see all the people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.<eos>"

Gail Rollins is a runner from Edinburgh, Scotland. She is known for being one of the best runners in the city. This summer, she wants to run the 10,000 meters and the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for coming second in big competitions. But she always smiled and laughed, and people in her home city loved her for this.

In 2004, Gail ran in her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She won the race in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up.

Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.<eos>"

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places, such as beaches, mountains or castles. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were many different kinds of dinosaurs. Some were small, but others were giants. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was very long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.<eos>"

The Globe Theatre was a very different place to visit in London 400 years ago. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. You can still visit the Globe Theatre today. There is a new theatre in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.<eos>"

Dear Jeff,

I'm having a good holiday in Australia. The weather was bad and cold when we arrived two weeks ago, but now it's better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were different there: red, yellow, purple. Australia is a beautiful country. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
