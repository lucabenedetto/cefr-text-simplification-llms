In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish people produce, the marginal cost of disposing of their waste should be charged. This will give people an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their careers. To be successful in today's world, you need to be more than just skilled. You also need to be able to communicate effectively, be open-minded, and be able to build relationships.
There are a lot of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you love and that allows you to use your skills and talents. Another is to be able to work in a supportive and collaborative environment. If you are able to find a job that meets all of your needs, you will be more likely to be successful and happy in your career."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.
The metaphor of broadcasting as sowing seeds is appropriate because it is related to the way that television is used to spread information and entertainment. It is also related to the way that television is used to bring people together.
In the early days of television, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to want to have a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you're not as good as others. There are a lot of messages that tell us to buy, buy, buy.
Caves are a small part of the natural environment that have been studied for a long time. They are mysterious and interesting, so people have invested a lot of research time in them. However, visiting caves requires physical agility, which means that cave research has been less in the hands of academics than other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere. Countless people started meteorology by observing the weather with their senses. Today, satellites and computers are used to relay and analyze weather information. But human experience is still the most important part of meteorology. It translates computed data into weather forecasts and provides unusual evidence that is helpful to professionals."

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences for audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily a form of theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music takes precedence in opera. The music is the heart of the performance, and it is what makes the event so captivating.
At a musical performance, there are usually people like me who have little technical or academic understanding of music. We may be aware of how much we don't know, but we are also awestruck by the skill of the performers. The skill of an opera singer or a musician is impressive, and it takes years of hard work to achieve such mastery.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't necessarily understand the nature of an actor's skill or are not particularly impressed by long and difficult speeches. However, this doesn't mean that theatre audiences are less generous or demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall. Many theatre audiences are the same people who attend music performances.
There are some things that could be done to improve the relationship between music and theatre. For example, music audiences could be more patient and allow the performers to complete their work without interrupting with applause. Theatre audiences could be more willing to try new and unconventional performance spaces.
I believe that music and theatre can thrive together, and I want more and more people to experience the joy of being an audience to both art forms."

Sand is a natural barrier that can be a nuisance. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you when you are wet. However, it also pours off you when you step onto a beach towel or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet. Sand can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.
A lock and key have been used for many years to keep people safe. They provide a sense of security and privacy. However, some people don't like computerised locking systems. They prefer to use a physical key in a lock. One locksmith company developed a new electronic system that incorporated a proper metal key into the device.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original text were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs.
Watching movies can be a very immersive experience. It can lift you out of yourself and transport you to a world where you are not beholden to ordinary reality. But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is broken and you are back in your ordinary world. You do not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents you from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in your boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'.
The studio where I worked was a complex place. It was difficult to find your way around. There were many different buildings and rooms. It lacked a focus. A decisive single main entrance would have been helpful, but there were three main entrances, all equally egalitarian. It was confusing for newcomers. But it was not a place where strangers were welcome. The employees of the studio worked hard and they were able to create a lot of romance and adventure."

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting, or perhaps balancing, at any rate precariously, on some vantage point near an upstairs window, and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. As a child, I had a sense of the oddity of her personality. She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate. As a moral code, this was completely beyond my comprehension. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked; it meant - oh, a hundred proscriptions and prohibitions."

I live on Philadelphia Avenue, on the odd-numbered side. The evening was dark, and the air was thick with rain. I knew this side of the street well. There are many houses on my street, and I used to play with my friends there. The houses are all different, like the little troughs in the cement that lead water away from the roof gutters. As I walked down the street, I noticed that the porches were lower and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, there have been changes to the houses. The wooden porch banisters and pillars have been replaced by wrought iron. The old stores have become homes again. I also noticed that the houses are not always used in the way they were intended. For example, a flat that was once a curtain warehouse is now a designer's office. The designer wanted to have a space where he could work and live, but he also wanted to make sure that the space was private. He broke up the space near the entrance with a giant snaking sheet of corrugated plastic. The swimming pool is a great place to relax and enjoy the rain. I like to swim in the pool when it is raining. The best moments are when the storm intensifies and the rain falls hard. Swimming is a subversive activity because it allows us to regain a sense of what is old and wild."

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness. They can also help us to express our emotions and to connect with others on a deeper level."

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. They are also having a big impact on human societies.
One of the biggest problems is that we do not know exactly how much the world will change. We do know that human action has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause the Earth to warm. The increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are already affecting global climate.
Another problem is that climate change is causing extreme weather events to become more frequent. This is causing problems such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts.
The changes to climate are also having a big impact on ecosystems. For example, changes in climate are causing forests and grasslands to move to new locations. This is having a negative impact on the plants and animals that live in these ecosystems.
The changes to climate are also having a big impact on human societies. For example, changes in climate are causing food shortages and water shortages. They are also making it more difficult to build and maintain infrastructure.
The changes to climate are a serious problem. We need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change."

A couple wants to go on a trip to Mars. They are middle-aged and married. The trip will last for 501 days. To be able to go on the trip, applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. If the plans of a multi-millionaire named Dennis Tito are successful, the trip will take place in 2018. The spacecraft will travel about 160 kilometers above Mars. It will use the gravity of Mars to return to Earth without burning any more fuel. The goal is to be fuel-efficient. The next launch window when Mars and Earth align again is in 2031.

Art is a powerful form of human expression that involves the creation and appreciation of aesthetic objects. These objects exist physically and are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they are housed. However, the very perfection of some of these products and their prestige can sometimes get in the way of understanding them. When artistic objects are separated from their original context and operation, they become isolated and difficult to relate to. To understand art, we need to forget it for a time and turn aside from it to have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. In order to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw, in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear, arousing one's interest and affording enjoyment as one looks and listens."

The early 1990s were a tough time for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes, and the economy was in a bad state.
Despite the challenges, advertising professionals still have to deal with a lot of problems. They have to do more with less, and they have to do it with smaller and smaller budgets. They also have to deal with the increasing demand for creativity and effectiveness.
However, there has also been a positive side to the recession. It has made people realize that advertising can be a valuable tool for businesses. As a result, there has been an increased demand for advertising services. This has led to a lot of new opportunities for advertising professionals."

When I was at university, I decided to become a chef. It was an unusual choice, but I was unhappy at university and I wanted to do something that I loved. Cooking was my passion. I started to learn how to cook by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens, and preparing extravagant meals.
One day, I was eating at a famous restaurant in London. It was a revelation. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards. After that, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world.
I also learned to swim. I had a swimming instructor who was very strict. He taught me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet. I practised that manoeuvre until the hour was up. The next visit, he got me standing upright, and diving off the edge. It was a lot of fun."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Reading and travel can help us to escape the deadening effect of habit. When we read a great book, our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Through reading and travel, we find new perspectives and insights.

Fashion is a long-standing phenomenon that has been influenced by the development of society and technology. As societies have grown more complex, people have started to wear a wider variety of clothing and accessories. The meanings attached to dress have also become more complex and significant. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people in different contexts.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. This has fulfilled many human needs and has also been used to celebrate national events and individual activities.
Music is important for a number of reasons. It can provide opportunities for learning and development, both vocational and social. Playing an instrument can help to develop skills such as concentration, punctuality and organization. It can also be a source of enjoyment and relaxation.
There is a growing demand for instrumental teaching. As a result, the focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. Ultimately, the goal is to encompass a wider range of musical skills and to make music more accessible to everyone."

The craft of acting can be challenging and rewarding. Sometimes, actors are criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to deliver a convincing performance. However, there are also many actors who are passionate about their craft and work hard to deliver a memorable performance.
One important aspect of acting is the ability to convey emotion and feeling. When an actor is able to connect with the audience on an emotional level, it can make the performance more powerful and engaging. Another important aspect of acting is the ability to create character. When an actor is able to bring a character to life, it can make the performance more believable and relatable.
The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the theatre creates a relationship between the performer and the audience. The proportions of an auditorium are important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it.

In the past, there has been a growing awareness that there can be risks associated with sharing information online. Some people have experienced the negative consequences of public check-ins, which are online announcements of your whereabouts. If you share too much information about yourself online, it can lead to all sorts of problems.
For example, if you write about your personal life on a blog, someone could read it and use that information against you. This is what happened to Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles. One day, an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company.

Tiredness is a common problem in many countries, especially in the richer and busier ones. In the USA, for example, 40 million people are affected by chronic tiredness. People often cut back on sleep when they are busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.
There are a few things that scientists know about human sleep. Humans sleep according to a daily cycle, and they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness. When dreams occur, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids.
However, there are also a lot of theories about what sleep is for. Some people believe that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.

Photography has been used to record human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well, but I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in this story. I have also taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.

However, both types of poets need to be able to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively. Poetry recitals can be a valuable way to learn about poetry. They can also be a source of enjoyment."

Oral History
The act of relying on oral evidence for historical purposes has its challenges. It is not always accurate to assume that someone's testimony accurately reflects their past experiences. In an interview, both parties are influenced by each other. The historian chooses the informant and decides what to talk about. Even if they do not ask any questions and simply listen, the presence of an outsider changes the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. The historian's social position and their own way of analyzing the past can also affect the end product. To be a good historian, one must accept responsibility for their part in creating new evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main approaches to studying animals - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body works, while those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it. Within the 'whole animal' approach, there is a distinction between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists work in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, while ethologists study the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap, the two approaches are distinct.
The Social Sciences
When you first study a social science, you have to learn two things at once - the substance of the subject and the methodology. This means becoming familiar with the knowledge and research findings in the textbooks, as well as the methods used to obtain and organize that knowledge. The two elements are closely related. Although social life is familiar to everyone, each social science discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, uses particular methods of study, and employs its own set of concepts.
Classical Architecture
Classical architecture was much more than just the construction of buildings in Ancient Greece and Rome. It was an art form that emphasized aesthetics over function. Vitruvius, a Roman architect, defined architecture as 'Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution.' These concepts were derived from earlier Greek authority. Though the temples may appear ornate, they are essentially simple, single-roomed huts."

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had mastered this new skill.
They decided to go on a journey together. They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. They left early in the morning and returned by midday. Lily drove impeccably. She overtook a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve. Chen went as far as applauding.
They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.
The journey was over and Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake."

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. Anyone could write a review and post it on the site. This made it easy for people to see what others thought of a book. The reviews were not always accurate or fair, but they did provide a good overall indication of whether or not a book was worth reading.
The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com were serious and well-written. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying. However, there were some issues with the reviews. For example, some people wrote fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people wrote reviews that were too biased or not objective. Despite these issues, the reviews collectively provided a good overall indication of whether or not a book was worth reading."

Art in modern times, has become more and more popular over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we sometimes feel that the artist has gone too far. We often say that what he does can no longer be called art. This is because we expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.
Here is a situation: An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book. He then asks someone to make a canvas for him, stretch it and prime it. He then asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. The finished product is a painting.
The artist's new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground. The sketches have provided the material for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings which convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit."

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession that was only affordable through strict economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a successful run of cases and they were coming in with regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.
The house wasn't really suitable for a family and they needed more room. All these things could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries.

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the need to be able to write clearly and concisely. The reviewer also needs to know quite a bit about the book or article they are reviewing. If a reviewer is able to do all of these things well, they can write a review that is both informative and entertaining."

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy."

I have been welcomed warmly to this foreign land. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote place. There are about forty people living here, mostly scientists, students, and weathermen. We all get along well and help each other out. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or have fun. I miss the subtleties and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no problem for me here, but there was a problem of self-confidence at first. I felt a little anxious at mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence that fell when I spoke. I still smile a lot, or panic when people talk to me. I think the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social confidence which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Alfred Hitchcock was a film director who believed that the most important thing about his films was the photography and the soundtrack. He didn't care about the subject matter or the acting. He thought that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background.

Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, and unanswerable. He was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream."

Birds are also important to us because they are indicators of environmental change. Conservationists in Britain cite the endangering of 30 species, which is a big loss of cultural heritage.
Folklore is important because it can help us to understand and appreciate birds. Stories, legends and rhymes about birds can evoke feelings and attitudes that we have forgotten. They also help us to connect with the natural world.

Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening.

Self-help books are popular in America. There is a huge industry of self-help books. Some people write self-help books to make money. Others write them to help others.

There are also people who write self-help books because they want to make money.
The genre of self-help books can be very popular. But there are also a lot of books that are rejected. Thousands of self-help books are rejected every year. This is because the books are not derivative or specialised enough. The author's prose style is not the most important thing. Marketability is everything. If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.
Autobiographies are also popular. But there are also a lot of autobiographies that are not true. The writer may decide to invent stories that encapsulate the truth more neatly, more pointedly than strict adherence to the facts ever could. Or he may break the pact by deciding, from the beginning, never to adhere to it.
Students of detective stories have explained the flourishing of this genre as an expression of the conflicts of late nineteenth and early twentieth century society. The detective story is essentially an allegory. The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society."

But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
When they arrived at the hotel, they were greeted by a woman who introduced herself as Mrs. Franks. She explained that they had been booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. But when they realized that they were in the wrong country, they became alarmed. They tried to explain their situation to the receptionist, but he did not understand. They were frustrated and tired, so they decided to just go with it.
The next morning, they found out that they were being offered beds for the duration of their holiday. They became alarmed and insisted that they were meant to be in Venice. But the receptionist was unable to make any alterations. They were disappointed and felt helpless."

Ernest Shackleton was an American executive who was inspired by the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America has only just discovered him. Now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. They are producing biographies and accounts of Shackleton's voyage, mounting a grand exhibition, and preparing a film based on his life.
Shackleton was a leader and communicator. He had his values in order and was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose. He was adaptable and willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh.
One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating. Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. He led by example and showed that everything else falls away when you are in charge."

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate named the aye-aye. The aye-aye has a lifestyle that is similar to a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae.
The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way into the wood and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations.
The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are other birds that also probe for or glean insects from wood, so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant."

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but few of us know what their lives were like. We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with a solution: she writes other people's autobiographies. She writes a hardback book of at least 20,000 words - with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.
The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. She writes other people's autobiographies and people enjoy doing it. The assurance of confidentiality encourages her subjects to overcome any instinct of self-censorship.
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each."

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. The flight was over and the students were exhilarated."

I planted my stake in New Zealand with the trees. I had a peculiar period of my life when I didn't have any summers. I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot. I like winter. My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which 'the kids', my brother, sister and I, could look after. We would always have a stake in New Zealand. We found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. It's rather poor land, but it's good for planting trees. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres. It rained a lot that year. I had a guy to work with me who was an experienced tree-planter. The planting was hard work, but it was also very satisfying. I enjoyed the physical work and the mental work. I wrote my first book there, Seeing Green. The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong."

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet and their eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before.
The cubs were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. I fed them every four hours and they soon began to progress. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around.
However, tragedy struck one day. One of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic and died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken. But fate took a turn for the better when a local farmer found a single male cub and brought it to me. I named him Willow II.
Willow II was a difficult cub to feed. It took me a long time to get him to eat. But eventually, he started to eat and grow. The cubs were finally weaned on to creamed rice and other foods.
As the weather got warmer, the cubs began to turn nocturnal. They would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. I would often go with them and have a lot of fun watching them play.
One day, I spotted some odder badgers in our field. They were probably looking for food. I was warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so I placed sheet metal over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers and there was a lot of interest in the story. We started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With the help of local businesses and the community, we were able to build a sett and the badgers moved in.
Now, I have a lot of fun watching the badgers play and interact. They are a joy to have around."

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was used by sailors for many years.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's voyage. He hopes that his measurements will help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field. The expedition will also have scientific merit. It will involve making the measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments."

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire display their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. The peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance. Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'.
The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates."

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. What separates humans from animals is a relatively recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.
Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many attributes once considered uniquely human are also used by animals. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.
There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity.
However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

People spend a significant portion of their lives asleep. Sleep is essential for maintaining good health and has a vital function. Scientists have not yet reached a consensus on the exact purpose of sleep. However, there are three main theories. The most common theory proposes that sleep is primarily physiological, serving to maintain the health of the body. During sleep, the body repairs damage and restores itself to full efficiency. Another theory emphasizes the learning benefits of sleep, suggesting that sleep allows us to process information and consolidate memories.

Book reviews play an important role in the success of books. Publishers and authors have different perspectives on reviews. Publishers rely on reviews to attract readers and generate sales. They often prefer reviews that precisely echo their own response to a book. Authors, on the other hand, are devastated by no reviews. However, they also understand that reviews can help to sell books.
The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is complex. In the United States, the New York Times can make or break a book with a single review. Here, though, the people in the bookshops often don't take much notice of them. It sometimes takes a long time for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet, some of the most dismally received books are the biggest sellers of all.
Overall, book reviews are an important part of the book publishing industry. They can help to sell books and generate sales. However, they are not the only factor that determines a book's success. Other factors include the book's content, the author's reputation, and the book's marketing."

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labor than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.
Volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and democratic participation. It can also help develop people who will act ethically in favour of those less well-off. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.
At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative and self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organizations they work for, as well as provide space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience.
Volunteer tourism can be seen as a positive way to help others, but it also raises concerns about the politics of volunteer tourism and the potential for exploitation."

You can fall asleep to your own soothing tapes and wake up to a day without news. The quality of the radio is excellent, but the size is a bit big. It's as big as a rugby ball. The snooze bar is wide and easy to use. Unfortunately, the buttons on the radio are tactile and easy to press, which can be distracting.

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers like to buy fresh produce. They often place their fruit and veg at the entrance of the store or even a display of house plants for sale. They also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around the store.
Supermarkets also use other techniques to attract shoppers. They may spread low-price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores. They may also offer special promotions or discounts. Sometimes, supermarkets use giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses to attract shoppers.
If you're shopping in a supermarket, you may see video trolleys that advertise products as you shop. These trolleys have a screen that advertises products as you shop. Sensors at the end of shelves trigger relevant advertising - so the shopper passing the cook-chill cabinets, say, may receive an ad on the screen for ready-made moussaka."

Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are known for their accomplishments in climbing and sailing. Bonnington climbed the summit of Everest in 1985, while Knox-Johnston was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handedly in 1968. They teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and their journey is documented in their book, Sea, Ice and Rock.
In 1979, the author was working on a book about adventure and called Knox-Johnston to ask for an interview. The author offered to show climbing techniques and Knox-Johnston showed sailing techniques. They sailed for a while and anchored. The author and Knox-Johnston climbed and paddled to the shore. The route was difficult, but the author was impressed by Knox-Johnston's steadiness.
The author felt that he was useless at times and that the crew was packed too close together. He also found it difficult taking responsibility for Knox-Johnston's life. However, they had a strong friendship and enjoyed their time together."

Apples have been with humans since the beginning of time. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. In the past, apples were very important to people. They were used for food, medicine, and even religious ceremonies.
In the Middle Ages, there were many different kinds of apples in Britain. Some of the most famous apples from that time include the Old English Pearmain and the Costard. These apples were very popular, but they were also expensive.
In the 18th century, there were two important discoveries that changed the way people ate apples. The first discovery was made by a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt. He discovered a new apple variety called the 'Hawkey'. The second discovery was made by Maria Anne Smith. She discovered a new apple variety called the 'Granny Smith'. These two apple varieties are still popular today.
Today, apples are grown all over the world. They are used for food, medicine, and even religious ceremonies. However, there is a problem with the way apples are being grown. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all."

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar is one of Britain's top 10,000-meter runners. He visits the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp, which is located ten miles south of the equator. The camp is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.
The athletes at the camp live in cinder-block dormitories and train hard. They have three work-outs each day, including a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon.
The daily regime begins at six in the morning. The athletes wake up, eat breakfast, and then go for a run. After running, they have a simple meal and then relax. In the evening, they bathe in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.
By the time Nerurkar left the camp, he was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. He couldn't stop himself pondering upon a rather different explanation for their success: the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, the gruelling work-outs, and the passion for success."

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. However, advertising can still be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.
If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly. But the advertiser does not know exactly which people will respond. This is one of the fundamental differences between the use of media and face-to-face selling."

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is a place that has a lot of surprises. It has a thirteenth-century chapter house called Southwell Minster, which is famous for its pagan figures of 'green' men. The house is also home to the 'autonomous house', which is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat.
The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off, there is a monastic stillness. The Vales designed the house to be low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build."

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered."

Throughout the ages, iron has been a powerful force in human imagination. Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen who have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. They also produced beautiful artwork, such as the ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral.
Over the past few years, there has been a revival of blacksmithing. This is due to increased interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist, and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.
The blacksmiths craft is a fascinating one. It is a combination of art and engineering. Blacksmiths are artists who use metal to create beautiful and functional pieces. Their work can be seen in homes, museums, and public spaces."

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she raged. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I understand why she was upset. I couldn't explain how I had been a smoker for so long and how I had stopped. The stop-smoking session was a mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not particularly want to. But I did stop. The physical craving for nicotine faded after a few days. The one activity that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order. Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing. I am increasingly coming to the view that smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes."

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed of swapping lives with someone else for a day? It would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
Amanda, a young mother, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant. Amanda had never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. Being a mother is definitely a busy job. It was all a far cry from her home town and, to be honest, she wasn't sure she'd survive!
Cindy's story was also quite interesting. She spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. It was difficult to stop herself dipping her fingers into the goodies! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work.
The two stories are quite different, but they both show that swapping lives with someone else for a day can be a lot of fun."

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born in southern Sweden and has a unique talent for playing the trumpet. His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers, but new works too.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, whom she persuaded to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson was an up-and-coming musician, and at once spotted natural talent.
Hardenberger has a gift for finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre. The boy bought all his records, and idolised him.
Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. He is a thoughtful and humble musician who is passionate about his work."

The film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases. He reviews A Abyss Long Before Titanic, The Thin Red Line, On Guard, Character, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
A Abyss Long Before Titanic is a Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. The film has impressive production design and special effects, but the dialogue and characterisation are not as strong.
The Thin Red Line is a war movie about the battle for Guadalcanal. The film is well-made, but it is not as complex or rich as Malick's version. The flashback sequence is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus imagery.
On Guard is a swashbuckler film. It is corny but highly watchable. The film has a consummate villain and an exuberant hero.
Character is a dour tale set in turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The film has excessive production and costume design, but the storytelling is not as strong as the visuals.
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a digitally re-mastered war epic. The sound editing is impressive, but the storytelling is relentless and cruel.
The Longest Day is a war epic with a lot of extras and a lot of action. However, the early sequences drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers."

Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become sick.
Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a science that can reveal a person's character and health. It is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting analysis can be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.
According to Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says, 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'
Handwriting can also be used to reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether someone is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims."

I climbed Kilimanjaro with Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes and ran out of water. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.
D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges instead. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit.
E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
I climbed Vinson Massif with a team. We all got to the top within 8 hours, but the visibility was down to just a few metres in the storm.
F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)
I climbed Elbrus with a team. We crossed open slopes and reached the summit.
G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)
I climbed Carstensz Pyramid with a team. We reached the summit by 11 am. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"
