In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags are collected regularly and taken to a local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people could be charged for disposing of their waste. This would give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to enjoy your work, even if you have a high-paying job.
In order to be successful in your work, you need to be able to communicate effectively. This means being able to listen to others, speak clearly, and write well. You also need to be able to build strong relationships with your colleagues and clients.
If you are able to communicate effectively, be creative, and work well with others, you will be able to find a job that is both rewarding and fulfilling."

Broadcasting is a technology that is used to spread seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.
The metaphor of broadcasting as sowing seeds is a good one because it is related to the way that television is used. Television is a two-way form of communication that is used to transmit words and pictures. It is also a centralised medium, which means that it is controlled by a single source.
In the early days of television, there were a lot of experiments with different ways to organise the technology. However, the most successful organisation was the one that was based on centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience. This is because it was the most practical way to use the technology.
As a result of the widespread use of broadcasting technology, people were able to achieve improved standards of living and enter 'consumer' society. They were also able to experience a wide range of cultural experiences.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of things doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where you start to buy too much stuff. Advertising can make you feel insecure. If you don't have something that the advertising tells you you need, you will be less than other people. There are a lot of messages that tell you to buy, buy, buy. These messages can be very persuasive. They can make you want to buy things that you don't need.
Caves are a natural part of the environment. They are mysterious and interesting. People have studied caves for a long time. However, exploring caves can be physically demanding. It requires a lot of strength and endurance. Because of this, cave research has been less in the hands of scientists than other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of the weather. People have been studying the weather for centuries. They use instruments and computers to predict the weather. However, human experience is still the most important part of meteorology. It is the human observations that translate data into weather forecasts."

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. In a musical performance, there is usually a lot of music and a few people who don't understand it. Some people are impressed by the skill of the performers, while others are impressed by the beauty of the music. Theatre audiences have different expectations than music audiences. They don't understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. However, theatre audiences are still generous and demanding. They are willing to follow artists into the most unpromising spaces."

Sand is a natural barrier that can be a nuisance. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you when you are wet. But it also pours off you when you step onto a beach towel or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet. Sand can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.
A lock and key have been used for a long time to keep people safe. They provide a sense of security and privacy. People like locks and keys because they make them feel safe. But some people don't like computerised locking systems. They prefer to use physical keys.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I noticed that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs.
Watching movies can be a very enjoyable experience. It can lift you out of yourself and transport you to a world where you are not beholden to ordinary reality. But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is broken and you are back in your ordinary world. You do not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents you from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in my boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'.
The studio where I worked was a complex place. It was difficult to find your way around. There were many different buildings and rooms. It was also confusing because there was no clear main entrance. But the studio was a place where people could come together and work on their dreams."

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked on someone's front path. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other memories that I can't put names to. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was very lonely and had a strange way of behaving. Sometimes she would get angry and clean the house or wash her hands. Sometimes she would be very quiet and listen to the radio. I remember my mother taking me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. Here, hand-in-hand, we would parade through roomfuls of paintings. My mother wasn't altogether averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification."

I live on Philadelphia Avenue, on the odd-numbered side. The weather was dark and humid, and there was a drizzle. I knew this side of the street well. There are many houses and stores on my street. I used to play with my friends in these houses.
The street is sloped downward. As the street slopes downward, there is a just-perceptible descent in the social scale. The porches get lower to the ground, and the front yards become exiguous. Over the years, there have been changes to the houses on my street. Wooden porch banisters and pillars have been replaced by wrought iron.

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. When we see someone else crying, we often feel sympathy and want to help them. Another reason is that crying can help us to express our emotions. When we are sad, we often cry to let others know that we are unhappy. Finally, crying can also be a reflex response to certain stimuli, such as hearing music or watching a movie."

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. They are also having a big impact on human societies.
One of the biggest problems is that we do not know exactly how much the world will change. We also do not know what is causing the changes. However, we do know that human activity is a major factor in the changes.
Scientists are working to predict the future effects of climate change. They use computer programs called general circulation models, or GCMs, to do this. GCMs are not perfect, but they can give us some idea of what might happen.
The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. For example, the average global surface temperature has increased by about 6C over the past century. The average sea level is also rising. And the patterns of precipitation are changing.
Climate change is a serious problem, but it is also an opportunity. Some climate change impacts will probably be beneficial. For example, the average yield of wheat has increased in Australia. However, many of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These effects include increased flooding, droughts, and changes to glacial processes.
The rise in sea levels is one of the most dramatic and visible effects of climate change. It is caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe."

Art is a special form of experience that involves refined and intensified forms of enjoyment. However, the existence of art products can sometimes make it difficult to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art products are often seen as separate from human experience. When art products are isolated from their original conditions and experiences, they become difficult to understand. In order to understand art, we need to forget it for a time and turn aside from it. We need to have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. Once we have done this, we can begin to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms."

As a child, I was always fascinated by stories of wise women. One day, I learned a lesson from a story about a wise woman. The lesson was about salesmanship and life.

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes, and businesses found themselves struggling.
Despite the challenges, advertising professionals still feel pressure to do their jobs well. They are often asked to do more with less, and they have to deal with the fact that their work is being constantly scrutinized.
However, there has also been a positive side to the recession. It has made companies realize that they need to focus more on their customers and produce advertising that is relevant to their needs. This has led to a rise in the perceived importance of marketing professionals.
Overall, the early years of the 1990s were a difficult time for advertising professionals. However, there have also been some positive changes that have made the job more challenging and rewarding."

When I was at university, I decided to become a chef. It was an unusual choice, but I was unhappy at university and I wanted to do something that I loved. Cooking was my passion. I started to learn how to cook by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens and preparing extravagant meals.
One day, I was eating at a famous restaurant in London. It was a revelation. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards. After that, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world.
I also learned to swim. I had a swimming instructor who was very strict. He taught me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet.

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Reading and travel can help us to escape the deadening effect of habit. When we read a great book, our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Through reading and travel, we find new things to appreciate and enjoy."

Fashion is a long-standing tradition that has been influenced by the development of society and technology. As societies have grown more complex, people have started to wear more elaborate clothing and accessories. The meaning of dress has also become more complex and significant. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people. Some writers earn money by writing articles or books, while others write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs. The novel gets written thanks to the generosity of others and the hard work of writers. Suddenly, we became celebrities. Our moves were monitored by our admirers and all of our needs were catered for by our management and other interested parties."

Music has become an integral part of our lives in the 21st century. In Britain, there has been a significant increase in the availability of music through various technologies such as radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and the internet. However, this increased access has come at the expense of a decline in live music performance and employment opportunities for professional musicians. Despite these challenges, music continues to fulfill numerous human needs and is an integral part of many national and individual events.
In addition to its recreational benefits, playing an instrument can also have a positive impact on cognitive skills and social relationships. Research has shown that listening to or actively making music can improve spatial reasoning, concentration and social skills. These findings suggest that music education can be beneficial for people of all ages and abilities.
To ensure the continued growth and accessibility of music education, there are a few key areas that need to be addressed. These include the need to provide more opportunities for people to learn to play a range of instruments, adapt the instrumental curriculum and measures used to assess progress to be more inclusive of a broader population, and train musicians to be more effective motivators, educators and community leaders. By working together, the music profession can play a pivotal role in raising the profile of music and ensuring that its benefits are accessible to all."

The craft of acting can be challenging and rewarding. Sometimes, actors are criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to deliver a convincing performance. However, there are also many actors who are passionate about their craft and work hard to deliver a memorable performance.
One important aspect of acting is the ability to convey emotion. When an actor is able to express themselves clearly and truthfully, it can have a powerful impact on the audience. Another important aspect of acting is the ability to create character. When an actor is able to bring a character to life, it can make the audience feel like they are part of the story.
The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the theatre creates a relationship between the performer and the audience. The proportions of an auditorium are important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it.

Tiredness is a common problem in many countries. In the USA, 40 million people are affected by chronic tiredness. In Britain, some best-selling novels have featured insomniacs as protagonists. People often cut back on sleep when they are busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.
There are some things that scientists know about human sleep. Humans sleep according to a daily cycle. They switch between four different stages of unconsciousness. When dreams occur, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids.
However, there are also a lot of things that scientists don't know about human sleep. It is known that women sleep for half an hour longer than men, and that older people require less sleep. But beyond this, certainties blur into theories. It is often suggested that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure."

Photography has been used to record human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.
Photography has changed radically since its invention in 1839. It has moved into what might be termed 'mythic time' and has passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document."

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I don't end it with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book is about my memories of a man I knew. I have little knowledge of what happened to him between the times I saw him. I could fill in the gaps, but I don't want to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in the story. I have also made sure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers."

Oral History
The way historians use oral evidence has some problems. Sometimes, people's stories are not exactly what they seem. When a historian interviews someone, the presence of the historian can affect the way the informant remembers the past. The historian can choose the informant and tell them what to talk about. Even if the historian doesn't ask any questions and just listens, the presence of the historian can change the way the informant talks about the past. The historian also has to accept responsibility for creating new evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main ways to study animals. One way is called physiology, which focuses on how the body works. The other way is called the whole animal approach, which studies the behaviour of the intact animal. Within the whole animal approach, there are two main types of researchers. Psychologists study learning abilities in a restricted range of species. Ethologists study naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap between the two types, they are different.
The Social Sciences
If you are studying a social science for the first time, you have to do two things at once. You have to learn the substance of the subject and the methodology. This means that you have to become familiar with the knowledge and research findings that fill the textbooks, as well as the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised.

Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had learned to drive. They made plans to go on a journey together.
They decided to leave early in the morning and return by midday. They drove to the English Channel. Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to admit that Lily had done a good job. They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was worried about the road markings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.
The journey was over the horizon and the ship was gone. Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake."

I read somewhere that if you dig a deep hole, you can see the stars. I asked you to help me with my plan. I climbed down the well and fell into it. I cracked my head. I was scared and worried about what would happen next. You called down and asked if I was all right. I was lying on the ground. You called again and asked me to let you help. I refused. I waited a while and then I climbed out of the well. I ran away from the well. I hid in the shadows. My mother and father came to see me. They were worried about me. They called me and asked me to tell them what happened. I told them my story. They didn't believe me. I was sad and disappointed. I felt like I had done something wrong. I was punished by my father.

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. Anyone could write a review and post it on the site. This made it easy for people to see what others thought of a book. However, there were some challenges. For example, there was a lot of fake reviews and some people wrote reviews that were not very helpful. Despite these challenges, the democratisation of literary criticism has been a positive thing. It has made it easier for people to find books that they will enjoy."

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. Today, we often praise artists for being unique and revolutionary. But sometimes we also criticize them for going too far. We expect artists to be different from the rest of us. We want them to have special talents and drive.
In the past, artists were often commissioned to create art for specific purposes. Today, we leave artists to their own devices. We get cross if they want to come down out of the clouds.
There is a new trend in art today. Artists are choosing to paint pictures of the world of the London Underground. This is a popular trend because it is unique and different.
I am a painter. I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I speak of the uselessness of art but add nothing truthful about its consolations. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side."

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession that was only affordable by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these things could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. She had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise. The overcrowded tube journey was a mood of envious resentment and brooding. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead and the smell of dinner from the kitchen. He remembered his grandmother's insistence that the returning breadwinner should be given peace and cosseting. The job was important to Lois and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia."

Heritage gives people and communities a sense of connection to the past. It is important for understanding and interpreting our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity. It affects everything from customs to material culture.

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the need to be able to write clearly and concisely. The reviewer also needs to know quite a bit about the book or article they are reviewing. If a reviewer is able to do all of these things well, they can write a review that is both informative and entertaining."

Ralph often looked forward to his solitary evenings at home. He would read or listen to music as the night deepened outside. He would feel grateful that he had a place where he could be himself.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed very quickly, while others take much longer. Some can be speeded up, but others cannot. If you try to rush a task, it will probably break down.
There are also different ways to think. Some people think quickly and make decisions right away. Others think more slowly and carefully. There is a type of thinking that is called 'intellect'. It involves figuring out problems and making decisions. Another type of thinking is called 'creativity'. It involves coming up with new ideas and solutions.
The mind can also be used in a more relaxed way. This is called 'contemplation'. It is like thinking slowly and quietly. You can contemplate on a beach, or in bed, or even while you are walking. Contemplation can be very helpful for solving problems and coming up with new ideas."

There are about forty people living here, mostly scientists, students, and weathermen. They all work together and help each other. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or have fun. I miss the subtleties and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. There is no problem for me here, but there was a problem at first. I was worried about my self-confidence and I would hang back at mealtimes. But I'm still smiling and I sometimes panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for this is because I've lost the ability to talk to people easily.

But from then on, since I had become successful, I started to see him more often.
Alfred Hitchcock was a film director who believed that the most important thing about his films was the photography and the soundtrack. He didn't care about the subject matter or the acting. He thought that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, the audience should react the same way, regardless of their nationality. Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise and rational. He was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream."

Amateur Astronomy
Many things have changed in astronomy over the past few decades. In the past, there were not many charts and catalogues, and telescopic equipment was limited. Today, there is a wide range of telescopes and equipment available. Computers have made it easier to produce charts and analyze observations. All this makes it a good time for amateur astronomy.
However, there has also been a loss of things. Now, you may have to travel a long way to find a sky that is comparable to the sky found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can last for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.
Society is also becoming more complex. There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. This can be stressful and can make it difficult to focus on the simple things in life. As a result, there is a new trend emerging: the search for 'simplexity'.

We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days."

Othello, a play by Shakespeare, was recently transferred to London from Stratford. The production is exceptional and allows me to make amends for an unfair review I wrote last spring.

However, I appreciate Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. The whole cast is magnificent, and there are many memorable scenes in the play. The pace and tension throughout the play are terrific. Do not miss this production.

A map is used to show the relationships between points and features on the Earth's surface. It is determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements did not give much information about the actual distance. Direction is also an important element of a map, but for ordinary travellers, it was not the most important thing. Written itineraries used to be popular for a long time, but maps are still used today. Certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, do not always show true directions. Landmarks along a route were sometimes indicated by signs. The history of cartography is the history of the increase in accuracy and comprehensiveness of maps.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop.
Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.
The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are other birds that also probe for or glean insects from wood. So, the woodpecker niche may not be vacant."

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea."

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have been looking after orphaned animals ever since. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet and their eyes looked up at me from their tiny heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. They were born between mid-January and mid-March and usually spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they die of starvation. These cubs were brought in by builders who had bored into the sett while laying drain pipes. They were cold and whimpering. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.
The cubs grew and thrived. They were fed every four hours and eventually started to drink from a bottle and move around. After a few weeks, they were eating cereals and other foods. As the weather got warmer, the cubs began to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often went through the orchard and the cubs would chase each other's tails.
One day, I spotted odder badgers in our field. They were probably looking for food. We were warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so we placed sheet metal over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
We built a sett for the badgers and they moved in. Now, I see the cubs less often, but they still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, an area that they have come to know well and a home they have readily accepted."

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was used by sailors for many years.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's voyage. He wants to commemorate Halley's accomplishments and also collect scientific data. The expedition will involve making measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field."

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. The peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance. Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'.
The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates."

The best boat design combines old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He designed his own boat, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has a lot of new technology, but it also has some traditional features. It's a beautiful boat, and it's a pleasure to sail on.
My own boat is different. It's a small boat that I designed last year. It's not as big as The Westerman, but it's still a good boat. It has everything I need to sail, but it doesn't have any of the new technology that The Westerman has.
The problem with new boats is that they often have too much technology. This can make it difficult for sailors to enjoy the experience of sailing. I like to sail because it's a challenge. I don't want to have to deal with a lot of technology.
My boat is simple and easy to sail. It's also very comfortable. I can sleep comfortably on my boat, and I can cook a good meal. I'm happy that I have my own boat. It's the perfect boat for me."

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. What separates humans from animals is a recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.
Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many differences between humans and animals are not unique. For example, tools are used by humans and wild chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.
There are some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. But these distinctions are not absolute. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions."

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.
Volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and participation in global affairs. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.
At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative or self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organisations they work for, as well as provide space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience.
Volunteer tourism can also be seen as a way to help others. However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of volunteer tourism, such as bypassing democratic processes and reducing development to individual acts of charity."

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
When you go shopping, you probably buy a few advertised brands. But you don't buy most of the brands you see advertised. Most people buy only a small number of advertised brands.
Advertising is still cost-effective. It is a cheap way to reach a large number of people. But it is wasteful. There is no way to know which people will respond to an advertisement.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence.

I guess my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours later was a little annoying. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnosis. It took place two months and three weeks ago. I had not planned to stop and I did not really want to. But I did stop. The stop-smoking messages made sense. They helped me to see that smoking was a problem and that I could stop. It was not easy, but it was not that difficult either. I am coming to the view that smoking had a lot to do with boredom. I miss my cigarettes, but I am not smoking."

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability to find water. She can hold a forked hazel stick above the ground and detect water. She is very busy these days because there has been a lot of drought. Most of her customers are farmers whose wells have dried up. To find water, Margaret uses a map and a hazel stick. She also checks the land with her hazel stick. If she finds water, she drills a well. The water that she finds is running in fissures of impervious rock. It should give a good clean supply. However, there are some challenges when drilling a well. One challenge is the cost of electricity to run the pump. Another challenge is the risk of farm or other waste getting into the water supply. If Margaret does not find water, she will keep looking until she does."

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born in southern Sweden and has a unique talent for playing the trumpet. His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers, but new works too.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. He had a natural talent for playing the trumpet and was taught by Bo Nilsson, a second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra.
Hardenberger has a unique gift of communicating through his music. He is able to make people feel happy and sad, excited and relaxed. He is also able to make people feel connected to themselves and to others."

The movie ""A Abyss Long Before Titanic"" is a Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded deep underwater. The movie has impressive production design and special effects, but the dialogue and characterization are not as strong.

The flashback sequence, in which the soldier dreams of his wife, is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus imagery of the woman on the swing.
The movie ""On Guard"" is a swashbuckler adventure film. It is corny but highly watchable. The film has a consummate villain and an exuberant hero.

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions.
When photographing people, there are a few things you can do to improve the quality of your pictures. First, avoid straight lines in group shots. Second, help your subject relax and find a comfortable position. Third, make sure that the subject is not overwhelmed by the background. Fourth, ask your subject to look into the lens. Fifth, look for familiar expressions and gestures that go with the subject's personality. Sixth, consider the overall composition of the picture, including the subject's placement and the background. Finally, take your time and experiment to find the best shot."

There is a debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that a lot of people film or photograph news events. This means that UGC has a big part to play in the future of the media.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most popular.
Acupuncture points are located along meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.
To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin at specific points on the meridians. They may also use warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on the meridians.
Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to relieve pain during surgery.
If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you."

The pen is more powerful than a psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a science that can reveal a person's character and health. If you apply for a job in some countries, you will probably be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting will be used to determine your suitability for the job.
Graphology can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. It can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain skeptical about the value of graphology. They say that handwriting is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands."

Living in the valley, we had lived there for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blew fiercely and the trees swayed. We knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river that threatened us most. The river flowed wildly and surged over the banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy the huge clouds that hang over the valley and be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses."

Film critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. It was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided they should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lacking in self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but they didn't get together as planned. So everything was done by phone. Mark chose film as his area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, they would hardly have come up with the present arrangement."

People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Primitive man collected pebbles, and children still collect stones and seashells. You can also collect flowers, pottery, paintings, or even toys.
If you want to start a collection, you do not have to be rich or powerful. You can start with small items, such as tulip bulbs or china cups. You can also collect items that are important to you, such as family photos or souvenirs from your travels.
It is the way that collections change hands that has always interested me. As small objects become a popular collector's item, they begin to rise in price. The toys of the 1950s are now positively an investment."

Mrs Malseed is always waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. She painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.
We had a good time at Glencorn Lodge. Nothing had changed. We played cards, and there was a lot of people around. We also went for walks on the beach. The next day, we drove to a different place. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape."

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.
Last March, Donna Laney lost her job and decided to go to Career Analysts for help. She was advised to take a year off and work in the Far East or to move into something more suited to her skills. Donna decided to use the skills she already had and move into something more suited to her than insurance. She is now working as a Public Relations officer.
If you are feeling stuck in your career, a visit to a careers adviser might be the right thing for you. However, it is important to remember that careers advice doesn't work for everyone. If you are not satisfied with the advice you receive, you should not hesitate to seek additional guidance."

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a comfortable blue couch. Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist. To make people feel more relaxed, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. He has a lot of relaxation techniques, such as virtual-reality headsets and a pleasant smell in the surgery. He also uses a special instrument that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. He found out that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession."

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is a popular treat worldwide. People in Britain spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter and Christmas. The cacao plant, which is where chocolate comes from, was first cultivated by the Aztecs, Toltecs and Mayans thousands of years ago. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate. In the past, chocolate was made from solid blocks that had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, a Dutch inventor named CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate. Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week."

I was dirty, smelly, and hungry. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more. I was tired of foreign timetables, currencies, and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel all over Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time."

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not there, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage, even the best ones. It is impossible to guarantee that your luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when there is a change of aircraft.
The system for baggage handling works like this. Airlines require you to check in at a specific time before your flight. This is to allow enough time for your baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Sometimes, there are problems with the baggage system. These problems can become severe at large transfer airports. If your luggage is lost, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR)."

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not able to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a lot of musical ability, they may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.
There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.
There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find the necessary fees. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. Finally, it can be stressful to be a musically gifted child. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands."

To become a successful writer, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. You can do this by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on.
Once you have done your research, you need to start writing. Write as much as you can and keep practicing. Each story you write will be better than the last.

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.
There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common types of dolphin. Bottlenoses are social creatures that live in groups. They are often seen near to European coasts.
One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are removed from an area, dolphins may not be able to find enough food to survive. Human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.
Dolphins are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to regulate the food chain and they are a source of joy for people all over the world. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive."

Four young sports stars talk about their lives. They are all dedicated to their sports.
Darius is a runner. He has always been sporty and played a bit of everything, but he was best at football and athletics. He competed for his country in the youth team and got a medal. It was a big moment for him, but it didn't result in much media attention.
Gabriel is a surfer. He is very serious about his sport and often the best waves are at dawn. He has to cut out late-night parties altogether to be successful. But he does love having a lie-in and he usually has to give that up too.
Dieter is a yacht racer. He is very traditional and always celebrates a win in great style. Sometimes the reporters seem more concerned about where you go out celebrating and what you get up to there than about where you came in the race.
Tomas is a tennis player. He loves being spotted by fans, but it also has some downsides. His last girlfriend didn't like it if he got too much attention from female fans."

Young shoppers often go to the supermarket with their parents. Sometimes, they want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents sometimes have a hard time deciding what to buy. They feel guilty if they say no to their children's demands. And they feel bad if they give in to their children's demands. Sometimes, parents are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict."

Ice skating has a long history. People have been skating for thousands of years. In the past, people used skates made from animal bones. Now, people use skates made from metal. Skating is a popular sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. To skate, you need to be relaxed and have good balance. You also need to know how to fall safely. If you are new to skating, you should start by learning the basic figures. Once you have mastered the basic figures, you can move on to more advanced moves. Skating is a great way to improve your balance, coordination, and strength. It also improves your heart and lung health. Combined with other activities, such as swimming or jogging, skating can provide a great overall health and fitness programme."

Chris Greener was tall when he was fourteen, and he is still the tallest man in Britain today. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. But when agriculture was invented, our diet changed. We started to eat mostly wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique.
However, there is a positive trend. In Europe, the US, and Japan, people are now eating diets that are more like our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in these countries is now taller than he was in the past. But there are still some problems. For example, the bed-length and leg-room in planes and trains have not increased, and clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? Scientists say it could be as much as 193 cm."

Studio audiences are a common feature of television life. They are made up of people from all classes, professions and income groups. People often go to studio audiences to appear on television, take a look behind the scenes, or simply have fun.
When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.
Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

We love animals. One day, my daughter found a pine snake. We decided to keep it overnight. I set up a special tank for the snake. It was a long day. There was a lot of confusion. The snake escaped. I was scared. I tried to catch the snake, but I tripped and fell on the floor. The snake was still there. I crouched like a rabbit and waited for the snake to move. But the snake didn't move. I eventually managed to catch the snake and release it back into the wild."

In our busy world, people use phones, fax machines and computers to communicate. But there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and the enjoyment of the contents.
I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mother when I was young. My mother also taught me to write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. When I left home to train as a doctor, I wrote letters to my parents and friends. I also had penfriends from all over the world.
I love receiving letters. They make me feel happy and connected to people. They also help me to improve my writing skills. I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition of letter writing. I encourage everyone to write letters to their friends and family."

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.
The mountain is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. People are damaging the drawings by stamping on them, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts of the drawings to take home as souvenirs.
Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but to charge a fee or rope off the area and provide guides."

Once upon a time, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also hosts the World Cup Climbing Championships. The fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. During the winter, they would either tolerate the cold weather or go walking instead of climbing. As the sport developed, it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. They used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls had special edges that made it easier for climbers to hold on. However, there were some problems with these walls. They could only be built in a vertical plane, and they were not very comfortable to climb. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a new material that made it easier for climbers to hold on. This material could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination."

If you want to become an actor, it's a risky career. There are a lot of actors, but not enough jobs. If you choose to become an actor, people will probably tell you that you're crazy. But it's a personal choice and only you can decide if you want to do it. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You need to be lucky and talented. But there is also the possibility of excitement, glamour and the occasional rich reward.
If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job. And, if you don't care enough, no-one else will care about you."

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They have a childhood game that is very popular. It's called pichenotte. The game is like a wheel-like board with 12 pieces called pucks. You can flick the pucks across the board using your hand. If you flick a puck into a hole, you get 20 points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
The Lagasses started making their own boards and selling them to people. They made so much money that they decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and started turning out boards. More than 450 boards have been produced to date.
The game is popular and people are making money from it. But there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet. Nonetheless, the day is not far off when the Lagasses' garage will be home to a luxury Mercedes rather than a saw and piles of wood."

Welcome to the Model Village. It was once a waste ground, flat and overgrown with brambles. But thanks to the careful planning and hard work of one man, supported by his wife, the land was transformed into the beautiful village you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat site into the sculpted landscape you see today. The village was created using hundreds of trees and shrubs, carefully selected for the area. The models, over 100, were individually made by the creator, Colin Sims. They are made from a variety of materials, including stone, concrete, wood, and plastics. The village is popular and well-maintained. You can enjoy the models and the beautiful scenery. Please keep to the paths and do not touch any of the models. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. We hope you enjoy your visit to the Model Village."

Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often include celebrities and other people who are in the public eye. Sometimes, these pictures are very private and can be very hurtful to the people who are pictured. However, very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is an organization that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The PCC rarely investigates complaints about pictures that are published in newspapers. This is a scandal. The PCC should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. If the PCC decided to take on this role of 'police officer', there would be several problems. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry. And if the person involved still refused to do anything, the PCC might still proceed with the investigation."

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious career planning. Most important, it should extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.
If you are thinking of travelling, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system, and are not likely to go off again."

Paul Forster went to a kite-flying festival in Malaysia. He spent a nervous night in the forest. He was given a kite that was traditional and had plenty of other kites. They sat down in the shade of the trees and looked at the festival. The kites flew into the air like rockets. There was a competition with more than 500 men and boys. Each person had entered four different designs. The competition ran for five days. After the festival, Paul went to the southern half of the state and took a wrong turn. He ended up at a river and had to take a boat across. He followed a path into the forest and stayed in a hut. Night was totally black and there was a lot of noise. In the morning, there was a tremendous view of the mountains. It rained and Paul got wet. He slid downhill and wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the enormous drops. He was glad that his car was still there. No one is a stranger for long in Kelantan. Everyone was friendly. Kelantan is best known for its kites, but Paul remembered it more for its human kindness."

What kind of shopper are you? Everyone goes shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers.
There are two main types of shoppers: addicted shoppers and reluctant shoppers. Addicted shoppers love to shop and can't resist spending money. Reluctant shoppers don't enjoy shopping and only go when they have to.
If you are an addicted shopper, you probably spend a lot of money on clothes and feel guilty when you spend too much. If you are a reluctant shopper, you probably don't enjoy shopping and don't spend much time doing it."
