In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

However, the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, have a strong mind and character, and be able to build relationships with others.

If you are not satisfied with your current job, there are a few things you can do. You can start by asking yourself what your job is doing to you as a person, to your mind, character and relationships. If you find that your job is not fulfilling your needs, you can start looking for a new one.

There are many ways to make work more fulfilling. You can try to find a job that is more aligned with your interests and values. You can also try to make changes to your current job that will make it more enjoyable. For example, you could try to get more training or education, or you could try to find a new way to interact with your colleagues.

If you are able to make changes to your job that make it more fulfilling, you will be able to live a happier and more fulfilling life.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

The metaphor of broadcasting as sowing seeds is appropriate because it is related to the way that television is used to spread information and entertainment. It is also related to the way that television is used to bring people together.

In the early days of television, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

The development of broadcasting has been influenced by a number of factors, including economic interests, social structures, and technological advancements. However, the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting remain closely linked.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can play on our insecurities.

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences for audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily a form of theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music takes precedence in opera. The music is the heart of the performance, and it is what makes the event so captivating.

At a musical performance, there are usually people like me who have little understanding of music. Some of us may be aware of how much we don't know, but most of us are simply awestruck by the skill of the performers. The skill of a musician is impressive, and it takes years of hard work to achieve such mastery. Being in the audience for top-class music is like watching an athletics match. We know that athletes are doing something similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also recognize that they are doing something that is far beyond our abilities.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They don't understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly impressed by long and difficult speeches. However, this doesn't mean that theatre audiences are less generous or demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall. Many theatre audiences are the same people as concert-goers. What perhaps it does mean is that audiences and performers meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere.

There are some things that could be done to improve the relationship between music and theatre. For example, music audiences could be more patient and allow the performers to complete their work without interrupting. Theatre audiences could be more willing to try new and unfamiliar things. With a little effort, I believe that music and theatre can thrive together and bring more joy to people's lives.<eos>"

Sand is a natural barrier that can be a nuisance. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you when you are wet. However, it also pours off you when you step onto a beach towel or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet. Sand can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.

A lock and key have been used for many years to keep people safe. They provide a sense of security and privacy. However, some people don't like computerised locking systems.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original text were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs.

Watching movies can be a very immersive experience. It can lift you out of yourself and transport you to a world where you are not beholden to ordinary reality. But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is broken and you are back in your ordinary world. You do not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents you from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in your boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'.

The studio where I worked was a complex place. It was difficult to find your way around. There were many different buildings and rooms. It lacked a focus.

To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing.<eos>"

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked down the street. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other memories that I can't put names to. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was very lonely and had a strange way of behaving. Sometimes she would get angry and clean the house or wash her hands. Sometimes she would be very quiet and listen to the radio. I remember my mother taking me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. Here, hand-in-hand, we would parade through roomfuls of paintings. My mother wasn't altogether averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification.<eos>"

I live on Philadelphia Avenue, on the odd-numbered side. The evening was dark, and the air was thick with rain. I knew this side of the street well. There are many houses on my street, and I used to play with my friends there. The houses are all different, like the little troughs in the cement that lead water away from the roof gutters. As I walked down the street, I noticed that the porches were lower and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, there have been changes to the houses. The wooden porch banisters and pillars have been replaced by wrought iron. The old stores have become homes again. I also noticed that the houses are not always used in the way they were intended. For example, a flat that was once a curtain warehouse is now a designer's office. The designer wanted to have a space where he could work and live, but he also wanted to make sure that the space was private. He broke up the space near the entrance with a giant snaking sheet of corrugated plastic. The swimming pool is a great place to relax and enjoy the rain. I like to swim in the pool when it is raining. The best moments are when the storm intensifies and the rain falls hard. Swimming is a subversive activity because it allows us to regain a sense of what is old and wild.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness. They can also help us to express our emotions and to connect with others on a deeper level.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. They are also having a big impact on human societies.

One of the biggest problems is that we do not know exactly how much the world will change. We do know that human action has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause the Earth to warm. The increased greenhouse gases are also causing the climate to change.

Another problem is that climate change is causing extreme weather events to become more frequent. These events include heatwaves, floods, and droughts. Climate change is also causing sea levels to rise. This is a big problem for people who live in coastal areas.

The changes to the climate are having a big impact on the world. They are causing a lot of problems for plants, animals, and humans. It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.<eos>"

Art is a powerful form of human expression that involves the creation and appreciation of aesthetic objects. These objects exist physically and are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they are housed. However, the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience. When artistic objects are separated from their original context and operation, they become isolated and difficult to understand. To understand art, we must forget it for a time and turn aside from it to have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. This means arriving at the theory of art by means of a detour. Once we have understood the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, we can appreciate art more fully in the context of our daily lives.<eos>"

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, but also added to their burden.

There are a number of factors that have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult. These include the economic situation, the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take risks. Other events that have made it difficult to produce effective advertising include demographic changes, the rise of the retailer, and the changing needs and desires of consumers.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Reading and travel can help us to escape the deadening effect of habit. When we read a great book, our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Through reading and travel, we find new perspectives and insights.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. This has fulfilled many human needs and has become an integral part of major state occasions and individual activities.

Music has a number of benefits. It can improve social relationships, concentration, and spatial reasoning. It can also be a source of income and can help people to learn other skills, such as punctuality and organization. For all these reasons, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.

In the long term, there are likely to be some changes in the way music is made and listened to. New genres of music will develop and there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. As a result, there will be a need for musicians to adapt their skills and teaching methods to meet the demands of a broader population.<eos>"

Photography has been used to record human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is made up of my memories of a man I met a long time ago. I have little knowledge of what happened to him between the times I saw him. I could fill in the gaps in my story, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to write down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in my story. I have also made sure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess.

Poetry recitals are a popular way to share poetry. There are two main types of poetry recitals: those that are intended to be printed and read on the page, and those that are intended to be performed live. The poets who write for the page often use complex language and imagery. The poets who perform live often use simpler language and imagery. However, both types of poets need to be able to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively. Attending poetry recitals can be a valuable way to learn about poetry. It can also be a fun and enjoyable experience.<eos>"

Oral History

The act of relying on oral evidence for history has its challenges. It is not always accurate to assume that someone's testimony represents the pure truth of the past. In an interview, each person is influenced by the other person. The historian chooses the informant and decides what to talk about. Even if the historian does not ask any questions and simply listens, the presence of an outsider changes the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. The end product of the interview is influenced by both the historian's social position and the terms in which he or she has learned to analyze the past. To be a good historian, one must accept responsibility for their part in creating new evidence.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to studying animals - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body works, while those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it. Within the 'whole animal' approach, there is a distinction between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists work in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, while ethologists study the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap between the two approaches, they are distinct.

The Social Sciences

When you first study a social science, you have to learn two things at once - the substance of the subject and the methodology. This means becoming familiar with the knowledge and research findings that fill the textbooks, as well as the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised. The two elements are closely related. Although social life is familiar to everyone, the social sciences go beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, uses particular methods of study and employs its own set of concepts.

Classical Architecture

Classical architecture was much more than just the construction of buildings in Ancient Greece and Rome. It was an art form that emphasized aesthetics over function. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was a long prehistory of basic construction, which did not match up to the artistic requirements of Vitruvius. However, the basic forms and arrangements of classical architecture persisted into later sophisticated architectural concepts.<eos>"

They decided to go on a journey together. They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. They left early in the morning and returned by midday. Lily drove impeccably. She overtook a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve. Chen went as far as applauding.

They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. Anyone could write a review and post it on the site. This made it easy for people to see what others thought of a book. The reviews were not always accurate or fair, but they did provide a good overall indication of whether or not a book was worth reading.

The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com were serious and well-written. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying. However, there were some issues with the reviews. For example, some people wrote fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people wrote reviews that were too biased or not objective. Despite these issues, the reviews collectively provided a good overall indication of whether or not a book was worth reading.<eos>"

Art in modern times, has become more and more popular over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we sometimes feel that the artist has gone too far. We often say that what he does can no longer be called art. This is because we expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

There is a situation where an artist chooses a piece of text and asks someone to write it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. But if the artist wants to do something else, such as draw pictures of the London Underground, people will often say that he has let the public down.

The artist's job is to reorder and make to show the meaning of the pattern. Through art, we can fulfil our true potential and not evade destiny.<eos>"

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself. The third is slower than thought. This slower mode of thinking is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.

The Wrong Country Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a very reasonable price. When Keith and Dawne went to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

When they arrived at the hotel, they were greeted by a woman who introduced herself as Mrs. Franks. She explained that they had been booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. But when they realized that they were in the wrong country, they became alarmed. They tried to explain their situation to the receptionist, but he did not understand. They were frustrated and tired, so they decided to just go with it.

The next morning, they found out that they were being offered beds for the duration of their holiday. They became alarmed and insisted that they were meant to be in Venice. But the receptionist did not know about a mistake. They were helpless and felt like they were being taken advantage of.<eos>"

Ernest Shackleton was an American executive who was adopted as a model of good management. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America has only just discovered him. Now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. They are producing biographies and accounts of Shackleton's voyage, mounting a grand exhibition, and preparing a film based on his life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as an icon and exemplar. They use his lessons in leadership and communications as parables for spin doctors.

Shackleton was a determined and resourceful person. He had a reindeer sleeping bag and a blubber-stove. He was a leader and communicator. He had his values in order and was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose. He made courageous decisions in times of crisis. One of the most fascinating decisions he made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. He believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience.<eos>"

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop.

Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.

The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are other birds that also probe for or glean insects from wood. So, the woodpecker niche may not be vacant.<eos>"

Most people have photographs of their grandparents, but not many know what their lives were like. Diaries and family anecdotes are incomplete and sometimes forgotten. We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos instead of photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional.

Hannah Renier has come up with a solution: she writes other people's autobiographies. She writes a hardback book of at least 20,000 words - with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.

The process involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews, which are used as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The book costs nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each.

The book is aimed at a private audience and is not available for public consumption. It's not vanity publishing, it's a way of giving roots and preserving family history.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. The flight was over and the students were exhilarated.<eos>"

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have been looking after orphaned animals ever since. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet and their eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. They were healthy but cold and whimpering. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.

The cubs grew quickly and started to eat from a bottle. After a few days, they were feeding every four hours. Within a week, they had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented.

However, fate took a turn for the worse when one of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic. He died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken but continued to rear the other two cubs.

Six days later, a farmer found a single male cub and brought it to me. He joined the fold and grew quickly. At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hardboiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening.

The badgers are territorial creatures and will kill others that wander into their territory. To protect the cubs, we placed sheet metal over the gate to their pen. We also built a new sett for the badgers to move into.

Now, I take the badgers for walks only occasionally, especially as they are not fully awake until midnight. I see Primrose only occasionally, but Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was used by sailors for many years.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's voyage. He wants to commemorate Halley's accomplishments and also collect scientific data. The expedition will involve making measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. The peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance. Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. What separates humans from animals is a relatively recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.

Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many attributes once considered uniquely human are also used by animals. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.

There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity.

However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

An eccentric person is someone whose behaviour is different from what is expected in their society. Most people have their own quirks and oddities. It may be a passion for doing something that is not common, a compulsion to collect things, or a tendency to write letters to the press. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two forces pushing against each other. One force is called individualism and the other force is conformity. In most of us, conformity is the more powerful force. The desire to be accepted and loved is stronger than the desire to stand out. If you have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour, you may find that you attract other people who share your interests. You can also find comfort in a crowd.

Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor.

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

Volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and participation in global affairs. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative or self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organisations they work for, as well as provide space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience.

Volunteer tourism can also be seen as a way to help others. However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of volunteer tourism, such as bypassing democratic processes and reducing development to individual acts of charity.<eos>"

One day, I met Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was a very famous artist and I was lucky enough to get his signature. I asked Picasso if he would be kind enough to sign my sketchbook, and he agreed. He gave me a drawing and signed it. I was very happy to have met Picasso and I still have the drawing today.<eos>"

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers like to buy fresh produce. They often put their fruit and veg at the front of the store or display house plants to make the store look more inviting. They also provide an in-store bakery that smells like fresh bread. The layout of the store can also influence how much you spend. Products that are placed in the most visible areas tend to sell better. This is called 'eye-level means 'buy-level'. Supermarkets often spread low-priced staples like bread and sugar around their stores. They also use lighting to make certain foods look more appealing. If you're a shopper, you're more likely to buy fewer items in chainstores than you would in supermarkets. However, the price of an item is still important. You're more likely to buy an item at a lower price, even if it means buying fewer items.<eos>"

Apples have been with humans since the beginning of time. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. In the past, apples were very important to people. They were used for food, medicine, and even religious ceremonies.

In the Middle Ages, there were many different kinds of apples in Britain. Some of the most famous apples from that time include the Old English Pearmain and the Costard. These apples were very popular, but they were also expensive.

Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples are grown commercially, and they come from just a few different varieties. This is a problem because it can make it difficult for people to find the apples that they like.

We can all help to save apple diversity. We can buy apples from a variety of sources, and we can also plant apple trees in our own gardens. By doing these things, we can help to ensure that apples will continue to be enjoyed by people for many years to come.<eos>"

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar is one of Britain's top runners. He visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. The camp is located ten miles south of the equator. It is a beautiful spot, but it is also lonely and isolated.

Richard has trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil. He also competed in his first-ever race in Kenya. The race was held in Nairobi. It was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil.

Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity. Kenyan runners are also known for their simple diet and relaxed manner of conversation.

The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya. The camp is basic, but it has everything the athletes need to train. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and have three work-outs each day.

By the time Richard left the camp, he was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. He couldn't stop himself pondering upon a rather different explanation for their success.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.

When you go shopping, you probably buy a few advertised brands. But you don't buy most of the brands you see advertised. Most people buy only a small number of advertised brands.

Advertising is still cost-effective. It is a cheap way to reach a large number of people. But it is wasteful. There is no way to know which people will respond to an advertisement.

If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly.

So, if advertising is to get going again, its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before.<eos>"

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is a place that has a lot of surprises. It has a thirteenth-century chapter house called Southwell Minster, which is famous for its pagan figures of 'green' men. There is also a greenest dwelling called the 'autonomous house', designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat.

The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. It is also very quiet because there are no draughts. The Vales designed the house to be low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build.<eos>"

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Throughout the ages, iron has been a powerful force in human imagination. Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen who have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. They also produced beautiful artwork, such as the ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral.

Over the past few years, there has been a revival of blacksmithing. This is due to increased interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist, and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.

The blacksmiths craft is a fascinating one. It is a combination of art and engineering. Blacksmiths are artists who use metal to create beautiful and functional pieces. Their work can be seen in homes, museums, and public spaces.<eos>"

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she yelled. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I guess my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours earlier was a little annoying. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnosis and it took place two months and three weeks ago. I had not planned to stop and I did not particularly want to. But I did stop because of the pressure from my colleagues and the feeling that I could do it. The physical craving for nicotine went away after a few days and I was able to work to deadlines without any problems. The one thing that was difficult was pottering around at home on weekend mornings. I am increasingly coming to the view that smoking had a lot to do with displacing boredom. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for a plane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes.<eos>"

Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work. To be a good leader, you need to inspire, be an agent of change, and develop others. Leadership is not about being tall or intelligent. It's about making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are. To convey enthusiasm and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak clearly and with conviction.

You can also become a leader by recognizing your latent talents and developing them. Everyone has the potential to be a leader. To become a leader, you need to find out where your passions and convictions lie and start thinking of yourself as a leader. You also need to set goals and work hard to achieve them.

Leadership does not simply happen. It takes time and effort to develop. To be a good leader, you need to be able to delegate and motivate others, organize and chastise, praise and raise. You also need to be visible and accessible to those who are important. But bear in mind, you don't have to lead all the time. Be clear on where your contribution is vital and how you can help others to develop as leaders.<eos>"

The movie ""On Guard"" is a swashbuckler adventure film. It is corny but highly watchable, and it has a consummate villain.

The pen is more powerful than a psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is a science that can reveal a person's character and health. It is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.

Handwriting analysis can be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain skeptical about the value of graphology.

According to Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says, 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'

Handwriting can also be used to reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether someone is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and heart and lung problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims.<eos>"

Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent, the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I climbed the Seven Summits in the order I completed them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

I climbed Mt. Everest with my climbing partner, Dougal Haston. We were in a snow cave below the summit when I started talking to my feet. The cold was getting into my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

I climbed Mt. McKinley with Dougal Hatton. The air pressure in the polar regions is lower, which has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

I climbed Kilimanjaro with Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes and ran out of water. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

I climbed Aconcagua with my wife, Sharu. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges instead. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

I climbed Vinson Massif with a team. We all got to the top within 8 hours, but the visibility was down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

I climbed Elbrus with a team. We crossed open slopes and reached the summit.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

I climbed Carstensz Pyramid with a team. We reached the summit by 11 am. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

The Brackham area had a lot of trees that were brought down in a terrible storm that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had changed the appearance of the town centre. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force, was not able to notice the change because he was sick. He had been sick with bronchitis and was unable to work. When he finally got well, he realized that the loss of the trees had made a permanent difference to the appearance of his living-room. The house stood in a sizeable garden. The garden had created an impression of privacy. Now, though, the storm had changed his outlook. Previously, the view from the living-room had featured the handsome walnut tree. With the tree gone, the room seemed cruelly bright, its worn furnishings exposed in all their shabbiness. And the view from the window didn't bear looking at.<eos>"

Living in the valley, we had lived there for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It covered the land and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blew fiercely and the trees swayed. We knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. And then it happened - the dam overflowed. The river surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. It was like the Niagara Falls. The river seemed wild beneath the bridge. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.<eos>"

Film critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. It was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided they should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. The newspaper was new and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that the paper would be successful. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lack of self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but they didn't get together as planned. Everything was done by phone. Mark chose film as his area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, they would hardly have come up with the present arrangement.<eos>"

The hobby of collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. Many people enjoy collecting things, and one in three adults indulges in this hobby. If you enter this world, remember one thing: if you do not fall in love with an object, do not collect it.

People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Primitive man collected pebbles, and children still collect stones and seashells. You can also collect flowers, pottery, paintings, or even toys.

If you want to start a collection, you do not have to be rich or powerful. You can start with small items, such as tulip bulbs or china cups. You can also collect items that are important to you, such as family photos or souvenirs from your travels.

It is the way that collections change hands that has always interested me. As small objects become a popular collector's item, they begin to rise in price. The toys of the 1950s are now positively an investment.<eos>"

Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Last March, Donna Laney lost her job and decided to go to Career Analysts for help. She was advised to take a year off and work in the Far East or to move into something more suited to her skills. Donna decided to use the skills she already had and move into something more suited to her than insurance. She is now working as a Public Relations officer.

If you are feeling stuck in your career and need some advice, you should consider visiting a careers adviser. However, it is important to remember that careers advice doesn't work for everyone.

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is a popular treat worldwide. It is made from cacao beans, which are seeds from the cacao tree. The cacao tree is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate.

In English-speaking countries, cacao beans are often called cocoa beans. They are used to make chocolate. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities.

Chocolate bars are made from solid blocks of chocolate that have to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847. Since then, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week.<eos>"

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage, even the best ones. It is impossible to guarantee that your checked luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when there is a change of aircraft.

The system for baggage handling works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a specific time before departure. This is to allow enough time for baggage to be transferred to the plane. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic cause delays. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. If your luggage is lost, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR).<eos>"

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not designed to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a strong musical ability, they may benefit from attending a specialist music school.

There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find financial assistance. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. Finally, there is the pressure to succeed. If a child does not meet expectations, they may feel frustrated and discouraged.

Overall, whether or not a child should attend a specialist music school is a personal decision. There are many factors to consider, such as the cost, the child's age and personality, and the child's musical ability.<eos>"

A chalet girl's work is always done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. She is a 24-year-old from West Sussex who works for a company in Val d'lsere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets.

Sarah's day begins early. She gets up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet. She has breakfast and prepares breakfast for the guests. After breakfast, she clears up and makes the afternoon tea. She then goes on the slopes and skis as much as possible.

In the evening, Sarah prepares dinner and takes a shower. She does not sleep. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. After dinner, she clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone.

On Sundays, Sarah has a busy day. She starts cleaning early and prepares tea for the new guests. She takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends.<eos>"

To become a successful writer, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. You can do this by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on.

Once you have done your research, you need to start writing. Write as much as you can and keep practicing. Each story you write will be better than the last. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not likely to be published. But don't be discouraged. Just keep writing and eventually you will get published.<eos>"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were a lot of people waiting. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples with their luggage and college kids with their bags. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He also came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. I understood why he didn't ask me. He probably thought I was unreliable. He swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed. He was talking to a woman reading a book. He said his daughter was flying out for a study year abroad and he had to go home to find his wife. The woman felt sorry for him. I waited to see where he was heading with this. He said he couldn't go himself because his wife was in a wheelchair. I thought that was a poor excuse. Also, it exceeded the amount of bad luck that one family could expect. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. It looked like he was holding a packet of something.

John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, a famous TV chef. Everyone has a chance in life, and John believes that his son Gary was given his chance with cooking. When John heard about the opportunity, he rushed to look at the place. It was in a really bad state, but it was perfect for what he had in mind.

John's wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all his accounts, while he ran the business. They lived over the restaurant and always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. Their children, Gary and Joe, are both very confident. They would come down and talk to the regular customers.

Gary was a lively child and always had loads of money at school. He had discipline and was up even before his dad in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and John was happy to see Gary helping out.

Gary was not very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. He was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then John knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair.

John's advice to Gary would be: if you start chasing two hares, you end up catching neither, so chase the hare you know you're going to catch. Gary went to catering college at the age of 17 and was successful. John is proud of his son and thinks that he must have listened to some of what his dad said.<eos>"

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was to know someone who knew someone who was leaving a place. If you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

The flat was upstairs and there was a cheerful-looking girl coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.'

Jo went on climbing and met a punk named Pauline. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to.

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common types of dolphin. Bottlenoses are social creatures that live in groups. They are often seen near to European coasts.

One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are removed from an area, dolphins may not be able to find enough food to survive. Human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.

Dolphins are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to regulate the food chain and they are a source of joy for people all over the world. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive.<eos>"

In their natural habitat, film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman are busy searching for the perfect shot. They live in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has been experiencing a lot of rain recently. The rain has caused some problems, but it has also made it easier for the filmmakers to get close to the animals.

Amanda and Owen have been working together for many years. They have learned to set aside four months on location to gather sufficient material for each half-hour film. Before they get the green light, they have to submit a script for approval.

The filmmakers have a lot of responsibilities. They have to put up their tents each night, make tea, and prepare meals. It can be a rough existence, but the appeal of being alone in such remote areas is that they can get close enough to the animals to become part of their lives.<eos>"

The Head Teacher said that if someone doesn't take the time to present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be? This is also true for other jobs. If you want to do well in an interview, you need to dress professionally, make good eye contact, and be on time.

Chris Greener was tall when he was fourteen, and he is still the tallest man in Britain today. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors used to eat a wide variety of foods, but today we mostly eat three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

However, there are some problems with this trend. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.<eos>"

In our busy world, letter writing is becoming less popular. But to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that can't be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of the contents. I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mom when I was young. My mom also taught me to write thank-you letters for Christmas and my birthday. When I went to London to train as a doctor, I wrote letters to my mom and dad once a week. Sometimes my dad would write back and it was always a joy to receive his letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters more. I also wrote letters to my boyfriends. It helped me to stay in touch and improve my writing skills. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. And it's even better when they are sent by airmail.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged rapidly. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The mountain is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. People are damaging the drawings by stamping on them, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts of the drawings to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but to charge a fee or rope off the area and provide guides.<eos>"

Once upon a time, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also hosts the World Cup Climbing Championships. The fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. During the winter, they would either tolerate the cold weather or go walking instead of climbing. As the sport developed, it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. They used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls had special edges that made it easier for climbers to hold on. However, there were some design problems with these walls. They could only be built in a vertical plane, and they were not very comfortable to climb. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a new material that made it easier for climbers to hold on. This material could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination.<eos>"

If you want to become an actor, it's a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs. But if you have the talent and the drive, you can make it happen.

To become an actor, you need to be naturally skilled and have a lot of imagination. You also need to be courageous and believe in yourself.

Acting is all about making contact with the audience. It's the moment when the actor and the audience connect. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job.

Welcome to the Model Village. It was once a piece of waste ground that was flat and overgrown with brambles. But thanks to the careful planning and hard work of one man, the village was built. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the land into the sculptured landscape you see today. The village has a lot of beautiful plants and trees. They were carefully selected to withstand the harsh weather conditions. The models in the village are made from a variety of materials, including stone, concrete, wood, and plastics. They are very well-made and detailed. The village is popular and is known for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. You can enjoy the village by walking on the paths and taking pictures from the pathways. Please do not touch the models or climb on the buildings. We hope you enjoy your visit to the Model Village.<eos>"

Tabloid newspapers in Britain often publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, pictures of individuals in the public eye are taken without their consent and published on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures are rarely in the public interest. They do not help to detect a crime or protect public health and safety. If the PCC decided to take on the role of 'police officer', there would be several problems. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry, and celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up. The role itself is too enormous and there is the embarrassment factor to consider.<eos>"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious career planning. Most important, it should extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.

If you are thinking of travelling, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system, and are not likely to go off again.<eos>"

Confident people often appear to be naturally gifted, but most will tell you that it's a skill that can be learned. Nina Hathway interviewed five people about how they achieved confidence.

A Jenny said that working at her daughter's school helped her to become more outgoing. She realized that she had to believe in herself and that working at the school was the turning point in her life.

B Michaela said that she learned to be confident by learning to manage her fears. If things get too demanding at work, she doesn't let herself feel guilty if she saves a number of tasks until the next day.

C Lisa said that she has to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. She has found that the best way to gain confidence is to tackle things that scare you.

D Barbara said that her confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work she does. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round.

E Kim said that she had to work hard to gain confidence. She found that the real secret of confidence lies in telling yourself over and over again, 'Nothing is impossible.'<eos>"

Paul Forster went to a kite-flying festival in Malaysia. He spent a nervous night in the forest. He was given a kite that was traditional and had plenty of other kites. They sat down in the shade of the trees and looked at the festival. The kites flew into the air like rockets. There was a competition with more than 500 men and boys. Each person had entered four different designs. The competition ran for five days. After the festival, Paul went to the southern half of the state and took a wrong turn. He ended up at a river and had to take a boat across. He followed a path into the forest and stayed in a hut. Night was totally black and there was a lot of noise. In the morning, there was a tremendous view of the mountains. It rained and the wind blew. Paul was wet through but he was still happy. He went downhill and wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the drops. He returned to Kota Bahru and everyone was friendly.

What kind of shopper are you? Everyone goes shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers.

There are two main types of shoppers: addicted shoppers and reluctant shoppers. Addicted shoppers love to shop and can't resist spending money. Reluctant shoppers don't enjoy shopping and only go when they have to.

If you are an addicted shopper, you probably spend a lot of money on clothes and feel guilty when you spend too much. If you are a reluctant shopper, you probably don't enjoy shopping and don't spend much time doing it.<eos>"

For a group of children between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are a time to learn the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are very popular. There is a long waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every part of the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train travels across the Australian continent, from the north to the south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', although it is known for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The weather can be very cold there, especially because of its northerly location. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb, about six hundred meters. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. You need spikes for your boots on Ben Nevis because the snow is very hard. There was a lot of safety equipment, including lights, hats, and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when they set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The track was steep and the legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, Keith had to rest more frequently. The others sometimes stopped for a break to let him catch up, but as soon as he reached them, they set off again. After a long climb, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be just as challenging as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. Keith was glad they had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when he was safe in the tent that he could say he really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways.

Tanya Streeter is a world-record holder in free-diving, which is a sport where people reach great depths on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by being the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath. She had been deeper before, but this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man.

Tanya spends a lot of time training for her dives. She does a lot of land-based training, such as exercising on an exercise bike and walking quickly. When she starts doing practice dives, she travels away from home and does fourteen dives over a four-week period. It is important that she doesn't get tired because that could ruin all the preparation.

Tanya also spends time making public appearances and supporting environmental organisations. She is well-known in some countries, so people are prepared to listen to her when she is talking about environmental issues.

But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas and made films that were successful for both adults and children. However, not all cartoon films are successful.

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made mostly of water and sugars. Bees can travel a long way to produce honey. They may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit many flowers to produce just a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. There are many different kinds of honey. The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food. It was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. It is good for you and can be used in many ways.<eos>"

The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six, says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. It's the time when you are learning about the world. Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years.<eos>"

Moonshine, a band, released their third CD last week. The CD is called 'Here again', which is a follow-up to their previous CD, 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee who left the band last year. The band also welcomed Tom Simpson on drums. The first song on the CD is a dance tune, and the second song is also a dance tune. The rest of the songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. They are excellent songs and could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford does a great job singing all the notes perfectly. Fans should be grateful that he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has unfortunately caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as all the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.) Overall, this CD is a good one, but I felt that they put their best songs at the beginning and the last few tracks were not of quite the same quality. Despite this, Here again is certain to be a big hit and bring more success to this band.<eos>"

San Francisco is a city in northern California, USA. It is located on the coast. In the past, there was a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola who discovered the area in 1769. Although San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Today, San Francisco is a popular tourist destination. People come to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.<eos>"

Today, people still use leather, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a few hundred years ago that people began to wear different shoes on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made in large factories using machines. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers. '<eos>"

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska, which is the most northern state in the USA. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In the winter months, there was no way to get to these towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. It took a long journey to get the medicine to Nome. But the dogs were able to complete the journey and save the people who were sick. Nowadays, there is a dog sled race held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

But then, the team that they beat complained. The story was written in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, read the story. He went to meet Maria and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realized that she was fast. He talked to Maria about athletics and bought her running shoes and took her training. It was hard work and Maria's legs really ached. But Jose visited Maria's parents and persuaded them that she could be successful. They agreed to let him take her away to train. In 1991, Maria finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family.

My name is Katie Atkins, and I'm 14 years old. I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools. Our band won! Each band had its own costumes. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch.

I have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. Only about half of the people who want to play get accepted. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot.

Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history. My school's really lucky because we have great teachers, and parents who've supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music.<eos>"

As many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels that bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels, dug in the 11th century, are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is divided into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.<eos>"

Flight dates for next year are not yet definite, but if you book now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the day.

The flight is about 12 hours long. You will see the first sea ice and icebergs about four hours into the flight. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, experts give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. You can also see a pilot's eye view of the flight from the camera next to the pilot.

While over Antarctica, we encourage you to get up from your seat and move about the plane. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow everyone to see the sights equally well from both sides of the plane.

Please note that we do not land on Antarctica primarily for environmental reasons. To experience Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.<eos>"

Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food.

You should also allow extra space for stopping. If the road is wet, allow double your normal stopping distance. If the road is snowy, allow three times your normal stopping distance. If the road is icy, allow even more space for stopping. Stay in control of your car at all times and you will avoid trouble.<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, usually between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders said that the number of house burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that most burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are not common because families are usually at home at that time. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To deter burglars, Inspector Saunders recommends leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

In the past, people had to travel a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and build bigger villages. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Nicola Peet left school at eighteen and went to college. After that, she worked at a local airport. After nine months, she started working for a big airline. Four years later, she got her present job as a manager. This is what she told us about her job: 'My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend most of my time in the air. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems. I also go to lots of meetings. My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses. Sometimes I go on long flights to check how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favourite part of the job, but I like office work, too. Travelling can be hard work. When I get back from a long journey, all I can do is eat something and then go to bed! I don't earn much money, but I'm happy with my job and want to stay there and continue to travel.<eos>"

Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films every year. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.<eos>"

In London in the 18th century, there were no policemen. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night. They were not paid very much. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Later, London became very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bait on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bait. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practices hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.<eos>"

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

The Globe Theatre was a very different place to visit in London 400 years ago. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. You can still visit the Globe Theatre today. There is a new theatre in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.<eos>"

Dear Jeff,

I'm having a good holiday in Australia. The weather was bad and cold when we arrived two weeks ago, but now it's better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were different there: red, yellow, purple. Australia is a beautiful country. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
