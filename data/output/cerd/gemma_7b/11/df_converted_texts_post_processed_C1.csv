Garbage disposal is a common practice in developed countries. In most places, it is free. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people need to pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise your imagination and humour. If you do not have these skills, no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this problem, we need to rethink how work is defined and how it can be reconceived to suit us all. This means that we need to be able to design our own jobs, choose our own colleagues, and have more intimate conversations with our customers.
However, there are challenges to this. One challenge is that many employers are not willing to let their employees have too much autonomy. Another challenge is that traditional conversation skills are not always sufficient for the new kind of conversation that is needed in today's world.
Despite these challenges, I believe that we can all work towards a more fulfilling and meaningful work experience. By learning to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise our imagination and humour, we can all create a more positive and equitable world."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to have a basic need to create a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you're not as good as others. We are constantly being influenced by advertising messages. They are all designed to make you buy, buy, buy.
Caves are a small part of the natural environment that have been studied for many years. They arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge. However, visiting caves requires physical agility, which means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of weather. Countless people originally laid the foundations of meteorology. Satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us with the minimum of delay. Computers solve complex mathematical sums at a speed beyond the capability of the human brain. Meteorological theory is complex, but human experience is still the vital ingredient that translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere."

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Opera is primarily a theatre performance, while music takes precedence in an opera. The music comes first, followed by the acting. At a musical performance, there is usually a substantial minority of people who have little understanding of music. Some of them may be aware of their lack of knowledge and feel embarrassed, while others are awestruck by the skill of the performers. Theatre audiences have different expectations than concert-goers. They do not understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly impressed by long speeches. However, they are often generous and willing to follow artists into unpromising spaces.

Sand is a natural barrier that can be harmful. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects. When you are wet, sand adheres to you like 'stucco'. But, when you step onto a beach towel or climb into a car, the sand falls off. It can also stay with you for a long time.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting content. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.
The studio lacked a focus. It had many disparate buildings and was difficult to navigate. To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing. But people who worked there could find their way about all right.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a solitary person. She was as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She had a strong personality and was known for her strict rules and her anger. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked.
Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city."

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was high. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses down the street that I remembered. They had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses that had once been homes had become stores, and the stores that had once been homes had become houses again. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?
I swam in the pool one day. The rain was falling, and the water was warm. I nosed along, eyes just at water level. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. It was at the height of this drenching in the summer of 1996 that the notion of a long swim through Britain began to form itself. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage."

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social significance. It can help to develop the attachment between mother and child. Tears can also be used to express sympathy, express helplessness, or be shed involuntarily. The sound of crying becomes less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. However, the exact reasons why humans continue to cry into adulthood remain a mystery."

The Earth is getting warmer due to human activity. This is causing changes to the weather and the planet's climate. The changes are already having a significant impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. The effects of climate change are likely to be unfavourable in many areas, but there are also some potential benefits.
One of the most significant impacts of climate change is the rise in sea levels. This is caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the melting of ice. With so many people living in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe. Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results.
Another significant impact of climate change is the increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts. These events can have a devastating impact on ecosystems and human societies."

Aesthetics is a field that studies the theory of art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight.
Another reason is that the perfection of some artworks creates a sense of prestige and isolation. When artworks attain classic status, they become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.
In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.
The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events."

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes, and the economy was in a bad state.
Despite the challenges, advertising professionals still have to do their jobs with smaller and smaller budgets. They have been told that less must be more. However, there has also been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want.
The production of effective advertising is difficult. There are a number of factors that make it even harder, including the economic situation, the changing needs and desires of consumers, and the increasing legal restrictions on advertising. It is not surprising that help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Reading and travel can escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed alongside capitalism. Fashion has a long history, dating back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in national events and individual activities. It provides opportunities for learning and playing instruments, as well as for enjoyment. There is evidence that playing an instrument can have positive effects on cognitive skills, social relationships, and concentration. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the longer term, there are likely to be changes in the way music is listened to and performed. These changes will require a shift in focus for music education. In order to meet these changes, the music profession will need to adapt and evolve."

The craft of acting can be seen as a delicate balance between execution and discussion. Actors often find themselves in situations where they are compelled to talk about their craft and themselves in interviews.

Blogging: Confessing to the World
Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people realize that there are some downsides to sharing everything on the internet.
There are a lot of benefits to blogging, such as wealth and fame. But there are also risks, such as being fired from your job or finding out that your private information has been shared.
In the early days of the web, there was a young man named Justin Hall who started blogging. He was one of the first bloggers, and he showed people that you can use blogging to share your life with the world.

Humans sleep according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness. Dreams occur during the lightest sleep, and the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids.
There are some things that we know about human sleep with certainty. Women sleep for half an hour longer than men, and older people require less sleep. However, there are also a lot of theories about what sleep is for. Some people believe that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure."

The most important thing is to find your own rhythm and let your creativity flow.

To save embarrassment to people still living, I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving. I have taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are a popular way to enjoy poetry. There are two main types of poetry recitals: those that are intended to be printed and read on the page, and those that are intended to be performed live. The poets who write for the page tend to write more complex and nuanced poems than the poets who write for performance. However, the poems that are written for performance are often simpler in form and content, and can be more easily assimilated at a single hearing. Attending poetry recitals can be a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken."

Oral History
The use of oral evidence in history has its challenges. It is not always accurate or complete. The historian's role is to select informants and indicate the area of interest. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists study the body's mechanisms and behaviour. Ethologists study the naturally occurring behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap, the two approaches are distinct.
The Social Sciences
Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance and methodology of the subject simultaneously. Each social science discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts.
Classical Architecture
Classical architecture is more than just the construction of buildings. It is an art form that emphasizes aesthetics and proportion. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, the basic principles of form and proportion remain the same throughout history."

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line, shooting the bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
They drove to the English Channel and Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to grant this. They parked in a small street off the sea front and Lily was unclear about the meanings of the roadmarkings.

The piano is very important to Susan, as it is her daughter's dream to be a concert pianist. The removers struggled to get the piano up the stairs, but they eventually managed to get it in. However, the whole process cost so much that it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned.

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. The egalitarian approach to book reviews on Amazon allowed anyone to say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars. This free-for-all system lent itself to mischief, but it also provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying.
The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com were serious and well-written. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying. However, there was also some silliness. For example, one writer submitted a review for his own book that was full of glowing praise. Another writer wrote a review that compared the book to the architecture of the Internet. These reviews were not taken seriously, but they were entertaining."

Art in modern times, has become more prominent over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we tend to get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.
The artist chooses a piece of text in an art book and writes it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. However, according to the unspoken rule of commercial success, once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it.
I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side."

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.
The house wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries.

Albert Einstein was a famous scientist who developed some mysterious theories about space and time. His theories are famous for being incomprehensible and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience. Einstein made a significant contribution to scientific thinking by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy.
Previously, people had described the universe using Isaac Newton's view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

The goats were being kept in order. They are very strong animals that can eat almost anything.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.
This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury."

I have been welcomed warmly to a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very isolated place. There are about forty people living there, mostly scientists, students, and weathermen. We all get along well and help each other out. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.
I met a young author named Elliot a long time ago. He never forgot my face and when I ran across him here or there, he shook hands with me cordially, but showed no desire to further our acquaintance.

One day, I received a note from him asking me to lunch and I conceived the notion that he was trying me out. But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message that stirred the audience, nor was it a great performance, he believed that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience."

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition that has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish.

I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting.

The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain and made the writing more careful.
The author also discussed the difference between books and electronic text. He argued that reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most people don't do it. The organization of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text rather than read it in its entirety.

In England, breakfast is a relatively new arrival. There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles. In the sixteenth century, it gradually became the norm to have breakfast. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. However, other factors may also explain why breakfast is so important in England today. For example, new patterns of employment may have contributed to the greater importance now attached to breakfast.

When a photographer takes a photograph, they make a selection of visual information that is determined by their technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, and cultural norms. These factors affect the style, content and expression of a photograph. The viewer's perception and response to the image are also influenced by these factors.
For example, a casual reader of a newspaper will have an understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the page. They might question whether the photograph accurately recorded the scene or whether it communicates the photographer's point of view.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed in maps varied with the purpose of the map and from place to place. In order to address the demands of different users, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions'."

Language is a powerful tool that humans use to communicate and express themselves. It is an instinctive ability that allows us to shape events in each other's brains. Language is deeply intertwined with human experience and is essential for life. People often talk to themselves, their dogs, or plants when there is no one else to talk to.
Climate and weather, which are created by the air around us, have a significant impact on the lives and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can be a powerful force on the character of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are home to a wide variety of species.

Art and the Visual Arts
Television often struggles to showcase the pleasure and complexity of looking at paintings and sculptures. Despite the ability of the camera to capture a whole work of art and zoom in to examine details, few series on television have successfully conveyed both aspects. A good example of this can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. The series focused primarily on American history and culture rather than great works of art.

The metals market is unregulated compared to other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take risks and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is an integral part of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago.

When Keith and Dawne went to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
They were offered beds in the hotel, but they became alarmed when they realized that they were being offered them for the duration of their holiday. They contacted the receptionist and informed him of the mistake. The receptionist did not know about the mistake. But the travel agency was able to help them. They were put on a coach and taken to the correct hotel.
They spent the rest of their holiday enjoying the lakeside air and the water birds. They were tired but happy. They didn't say to one another that there was an irony in the catastrophe that had occurred."

Ernest Shackleton was an American executive who was adopted as a model of good management. Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America has only just discovered him. Now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. They are producing biographies and accounts of Shackleton's voyage, mounting a grand exhibition, and preparing a film based on his life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as an icon and exemplar. His qualities as a leader and communicator are being used to teach others.
Shackleton was known for his determination, resourcefulness, and ability to lead others. He was also known for his ability to communicate clearly and effectively. He believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. He led by example and showed others that anything can be accomplished with hard work and determination."
