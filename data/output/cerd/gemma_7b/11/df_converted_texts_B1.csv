In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish produced, people would have to buy less of just about everything.

A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference. If that's the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price.<eos>"

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise your imagination and humour. If you do not have these skills, no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.

To counter this problem, we need to rethink how work is defined and how it can be reconceived to suit us all. This means that we need to be able to design our own jobs, choose our own colleagues, and have more intimate conversations with our customers.

However, there are challenges to this. One challenge is that many employers are not willing to let their employees have too much autonomy. Another challenge is that traditional conversation skills are not always sufficient for the new kind of conversation that is needed in today's world.

Despite these challenges, I believe that we can all work towards a more fulfilling and meaningful work experience. By learning to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise our imagination and humour, we can all create a more positive and equitable world.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, which means that there are centralised resources intended and suited for spreading and reproduction.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is striking that it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising can play on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you're not as good as others. There are a lot of messages that tell us to buy, buy, buy.

Caves are a natural part of the environment. They are mysterious and interesting, so people have studied them for a long time. But you need to be physically fit to visit many caves.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily a theatre performance, while music comes first in an opera. Music is a powerful and expressive art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including listening to recordings, attending concerts, and performing. Theatre is also a powerful art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including watching plays, attending festivals, and participating in acting classes.

There are some similarities between music and theatre. For example, they both require skill and dedication. They also both have the ability to bring people together. And they both have the ability to inspire and entertain.

There are also some differences between music and theatre. For example, music is more focused on sound and rhythm, while theatre is more focused on acting and storytelling. Music is also more portable, while theatre is more confined to specific locations.

Overall, music and theatre are two complementary art forms that can enrich our lives in many ways. They can evoke a wide range of emotions, bring people together, and inspire and entertain.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting content. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.

My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.

My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. I remember her as a lonely person who was always angry. She was also very possessive of her belongings. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked.

Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Plants and animals are being affected by these changes, as well as water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

Some of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in glacial processes, and rising sea levels. The consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe, with many people losing their homes and livelihoods.

It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. We also need to develop new technologies to help us adapt to the changing climate.<eos>"

Aesthetics is a field that studies the theory of art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight.

Another reason is that the perfection of some artworks creates a sense of prestige and isolation. When artworks attain classic status, they become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.

In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.

The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events.<eos>"

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.

There are a number of factors that have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult. These include the economic situation, the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take risks. Other events that have made it difficult to produce effective advertising include demographic changes, the rise of the retailer, and the changing needs and desires of consumers.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Reading and travel can escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed thanks to the influence of nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism. Fashion has a long history, dating back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have grown more complex, the variety of clothing and adornment has increased, and the meanings attached to dress have become more complex and significant. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people in different contexts.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in national events and individual activities. It provides opportunities for learning and playing instruments, as well as for enjoyment. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can have positive effects on cognitive skills and social relationships. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the longer term, there are likely to be changes in the way music is listened to and performed. These changes will require a shift in focus for music education. In order to meet these changes, the music profession will need to adapt and evolve.<eos>"

Blogging: Confessing to the World

Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing so much information on the internet.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment and to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also been used to promote social and political change and development.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society.

Photography is regarded quite naturally as offering such convincing forms of pictorial evidence that this process of communication often seems to render the medium totally transparent, blurring the distinction between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations.<eos>"

Poetry is like a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and careful. If you make a mistake, it can be a disaster. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination. You can also write to express your feelings or to tell a story. There are different ways to write poetry. You can write to a schedule, or you can wait for inspiration. The most important thing is to find your own style and to write with passion.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or a lot of unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they are necessary. Dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. It can reveal two sides of a question in less time than explaining it from only one person's viewpoint. Overwriting can kill a short story from the start. But brevity does not mean that you have to reduce the story to a synopsis. You need to sustain the conflict and action in a short story as well as in a novel.

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well, but I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in this story. I have also taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers. I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I have taken the liberty that historians have taken to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard. I have done this for the same reasons that the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted. I want to be read and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make my book readable.<eos>"

Poetry recitals are happening all the time. There are different kinds of poetry being written and different ways of presenting poetry. Some poets write poems that are meant to be read on the page, while others write poems that are meant to be read aloud. There are also different ways to promote poetry recitals. Some people hold poetry readings in village halls or their homes. Schools and colleges sometimes invite poets to read their poems to students. Arts festivals sometimes have poetry readings by well-known authors. The consequences of all these events are manifold and of uncertain benefit to poets. If you want to learn more about poetry, you can attend a poetry reading. However, you should also read the poems on your own.<eos>"

Oral History

The use of oral evidence in history has its challenges. It is not always accurate or complete. The historian's role is to select informants and indicate the area of interest. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to studying animals. The physiological approach focuses on how the body works. The whole animal approach studies the behaviour of the intact animal. Within the whole animal approach, there are two main types of study: psychology and ethology.

The Social Sciences

Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance and methodology of the subject at the same time. Each social science discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts.

Classical Architecture

Classical architecture is more than just the construction of buildings. It is an art form that emphasizes aesthetics over function. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, the basic principles of classical architecture persisted into later sophisticated architectural concepts.<eos>"

Art in modern times, has become more and more popular over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we sometimes feel that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both.

Heritage gives people a sense of connection to the past. It helps us understand and interpret our individual and national futures. It is a fundamental desire for continuity. It affects everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link with the past was through stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But, because Western industrial society broke up communities and families, much of that oral tradition has already been lost. Instead, places and architectural 'memories' give us clues to our past. It is vitally important to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

Museums make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed - were used - had meaning - at some historical time. Museums which rise to the challenge and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.

The desire to preserve things is not new. Change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it. Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it. Physical change, in other words, change in the environment provided by our towns, reflects social change - change in our numbers, in our welfare and in our demands.<eos>"

It also follows that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.<eos>"

I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Alfred Hitchcock was a film director who believed that the most important thing about his films was the photography and the soundtrack. He didn't care about the subject matter or the acting. Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, and unanswerable. He was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction, or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory.

In England, breakfast is a relatively new arrival. There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were wealthy. However, in the sixteenth century, it gradually became the norm to have breakfast. Some writers have suggested that this is because there was more food available. Others have suggested that it is because people started working earlier. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed in maps varied with the purpose of the map and from place to place.

The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

**Questions:**

1. What does the aye-aye use its incisor teeth to do?
2. How does the aye-aye locate the insects hidden inside the wood?
3. What is the relationship between the aye-aye and the woodpecker?

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but few of us know what their lives were like. We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. She writes a hardback book of at least 20,000 words - with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.

The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. She writes other people's autobiographies, producing a hardback book of at least 20,000 words -- with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each.<eos>"

From here to paternity, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children. I have loved every minute of it. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond.

I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me.

I have never felt out of touch. Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.

I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting. I've noticed more and more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more conscious of the need to involve our children in our lives.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.<eos>"

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.

The cubs were fed every four hours and grew quickly. After a few weeks, they were able to drink from a bottle and move around. They were very contented. However, one of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic and died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken by my failure, but fate worked in strange ways. Six days later, I found another male cub, Willow II, who was abandoned by his mother.

Willow II joined the fold and grew quickly. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages, he was ready to move on to something else.

The cubs are now eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hardboiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. They are also digging for earthworms. As 'human badgers', we often go for walks with the cubs in the evening. We see Primrose only occasionally, but Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass. These variations, known as declination, are the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various locations, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland. From these travels, he published a chart that showed the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. His work was instrumental for seamen for more than a century.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate Halley's accomplishments. He aims to retrace Halley's route and conduct scientific measurements. The expedition, titled 'In the Wake of the Paramore,' will involve using precise instruments to measure declination and refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.

Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has extensive experience sailing and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He also has a strong motivation and determination to complete the expedition.<eos>"

Peacocks that live at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks' tail is not necessarily an indicator of fitness. Wallace suggested that the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival. Now, researchers are trying to understand why peacocks have such elaborate trains. They are studying the relationship between the size of the train and the number of mates a peacock has. They are also looking at the health and growth of the offspring of peacocks with different sized trains. The results of this research could help us to understand better how peacocks have evolved and why they have such elaborate trains.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans have not developed any significant differences from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps genetically. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities between humans and animals exist. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. Monkeys also have a simple one-word language. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it is strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.

There are three main distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, while animal activities are mostly utilitarian. Second, human art is made for aesthetic pleasure, while animal activities are often made for survival or reproduction. Third, human art is learned, while animal activities are instinctive.

These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale.

There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialize in them. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life.

Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The team was composed of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese, 30 camels and six camel handlers.

The team suffered unspeakable hardships, but they managed to find water and survive. They walked for 1,000 kilometres and were very thin and muscular despite their physical exhaustion.

Blackmore went on to describe lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. He felt prouder of that expedition than of anything else he'd done.<eos>"

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played off the board as well as on it. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire.<eos>"

Volunteer tourism is a topic that four academic writers discuss. It can be a positive or negative experience. On the one hand, volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks. It can also raise awareness of existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty. On the other hand, volunteer tourism can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development. It can also bypass the democratic imperative of representative government and reduce development to individual acts of charity.

Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty. However, volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble 'making a difference', can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate.<eos>"

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The number of spines a hedgehog has affects its ability to defend itself. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so.

The day I met Picasso, I was an 18-year-old student travelling around Europe and Morocco. I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront and spent much of my time drawing. One day, I met Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was seated with his wife and three companions. I was surprised to see him and managed to get his signature. Picasso was known to be a reclusive artist, but he was friendly and willing to sign my sketchbook. He also gave me a drawing of himself. I was delighted to meet Picasso and feel that I was lucky to have had this experience.<eos>"

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers like to buy fresh produce. They often place their fruit and veg at the entrance of the store or even a display of house plants for sale. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store.

Supermarkets also use lighting to attract shoppers. They use special lighting to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg. They also use lighting to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting. One pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'.

As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you. Supermarkets often use in-store promotion to attract shoppers. They use giant colour photographs to advertise products. They also use video trolleys to advertise products.<eos>"

Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are known for their achievements in climbing and sailing. Chris Bonnington has climbed the summit of Everest and pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps. Robin Knox-Johnston was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handedly. They have written books about their adventures, including Sea, Ice and Rock.

One day, Chris and Robin were sailing in Greenland. They invited me to join them and I was able to show them some climbing techniques and they showed me the rudiments of sailing. We sailed for a while and then anchored. We went ashore and exercised Robin's skills at climbing. The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions.

The trip to Skye was a memorable one. Robin and I built a strong friendship during that trip. We spent a lot of time together and I learned a lot from him. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.<eos>"

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-meter runners, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. The camp is located ten miles south of the equator and is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and train hard every day. Their daily regime includes a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon.

When the day's running is over, the athletes have a simple life. They eat a basic diet, drink plenty of tea, and bathe in the streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers. By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is also fragmented because brands and media have proliferated. As a result, most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised.

Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. The most cost-effective way to reach the relevant minority is to use mass media, but if advertising is to get going again its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before.<eos>"

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed to be energy-efficient and sustainable. It uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles its sewage into garden compost, and heats the house with waste heat from electrical appliances and its own body heat. The house is also super-insulated with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows. There is a monastic stillness inside the house. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. The house has a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales claim not to use except in the very coldest winter. So is it warm in winter? One night in February when I happened to call on him, Robert was sitting reading. It was too warm to light the fire, he said. The room temperature on the first floor was 18C, less than the generally expected temperature of living areas, but entirely comfortable, he claimed, because there are no draughts, no radiant heat loss.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been making weapons, armour and farming tools since the beginning of time. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but they are still admired for their artistry.

There has been a recent revival in blacksmithing thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Artists now have a new material that allows them to express themselves more freely. The metal is soft when it is hot, but it becomes rigid and immovable when it cools down.

Many blacksmiths are fascinated by the unique properties of iron. They love the fact that it is cold and hard, and the way it feels as though it is there forever. No other base metal can give man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security.<eos>"

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she raged. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I guess my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I was not anymore was a little annoying. The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. But I did stop. The physical craving and the pangs of desire for nicotine faded after a few days. I am increasingly coming to the view that smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much.<eos>"

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense' that allows her to locate water. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business.

Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. Once she has found the likely areas, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the stick rises up. If there is no water, the stick does not rise up.

Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed.

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!

C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. But I dithered for ages about how to look. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials. Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.

D. Hilary's story I arrived at the farm early, but I discovered that Rosemary had been up for hours. The process of milking the cows took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day.<eos>"

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but it also means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.

The sales of print newspapers are plummeting while visits to their websites keep on soaring. The latest print circulation figures show that many newspapers are down between 8% and 10% year-on-year. However, the latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference.

The decline in newspaper sales is a complex issue. There are many factors that contribute to it, including timing, demography, geography, and the rise of e-readers. However, the evidence suggests that print is still a valuable tool for newspapers. It is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions.

Of course, the decline in newspaper sales is a challenge for newspaper companies. However, there are a number of things that newspapers can do to adapt to the changing landscape. One thing that newspapers can do is to offer joint packages that include print and digital access. Another thing that newspapers can do is to focus on providing high-quality content.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

To photograph people well, you need to consider the following:

- Group people at different angles and distances.
- Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
- Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
- Ask your subject to look into the lens.
- Use a background that is relevant to the subject.
- Show the interaction between people.
- Take pictures of people in their natural environment.
- Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting.
- Decide whether you want to pose or not pose your subject.<eos>"

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although it is easier to capture newsworthy events with digital cameras and camera phones, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, there is ongoing debate about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that a significant number of people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to maintain its relationship with the public, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received the most attention.

Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can experience pain.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.

If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you.<eos>"

Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent, the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I climbed the Seven Summits in the order I completed them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

I was talking to my feet and recalling other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite. The cold was getting into my feet and I was worried about the quality of our survival.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

The air pressure in the polar regions is lower, which has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

We got lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes and ran out of water. We spent the second day trying to find water and came across luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish which brought us to a rock pool.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges instead.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

We walked to the refuge at 4,200m and crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

We reached the summit by 11 am. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

No title. Many trees in the Brackham area were blown down in a terrible storm that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had altered the appearance of the town centre entirely. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force, was annoyed by the change. He was sick with bronchitis and couldn't concentrate. His wife, Molly, tried to persuade him to go to the doctor, but he refused. The storm had also damaged his house, but Pelham was more concerned about the loss of the trees. When he finally went to the doctor, he was prescribed antibiotics and told to rest. The loss of the trees had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The room seemed cruelly bright and the worn furnishings were exposed. The tall house next door was now dominating the outlook. It seemed to have a great many upstairs windows, all of them watching the Pelhams' every movement.<eos>"

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The river threatened us most. It was flowing wildly and was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. The dam held and the waters began to subside. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley.

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because it's fun. Teenager with a taste for endurance WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). Ability to do all three without a rest essential. The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping. Great for those watching, maybe, but what makes the triathletes want to punish their bodies so much? And what makes an attractive 17-year-old, with excellent academic results, give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers?

Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes automatically use when asked similar questions. 'You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 1Okm, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,' she says.

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. 'I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went round.' Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. 'I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realised then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the running.' But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. 'Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again.' Such doggedness draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. 'I've just been testing her fitness,' he says, 'and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realise they can't go any further, she just kept on.'

Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with PS1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.'<eos>"

The Collectors

Amanda Roy writes about her passion for collecting and the reasons why people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. If you enter this world, remember one thing: you must fall in love with an object before you collect it. People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. Others collect flowers, pottery or paintings. If you are interested in collecting, there are many things you can collect. You do not have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. You can collect items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. As small objects become a popular collector's item, they begin to rise in price.<eos>"

Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and remembering that it wasn't about passing or failing. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and they will produce a report giving their observations and recommendations.

If you are considering changing your career, you should think about the pros and cons of each option. You may need to weigh the cost of retraining against your financial commitments.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847. Today, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week.<eos>"

Since they first found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.

Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put money into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The system works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a specific time before departure. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are designed to allow for baggage transfers. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic can cause delays. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.<eos>"

A child who shows outstanding musical ability may need a special understanding and education. There are five music schools in Britain that provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. These schools offer a range of musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also provide a restricted academic programme, which concentrates on the essential subjects.

The disadvantages of attending a specialist music school include the cost and the need to board away from home. It may also be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education.

For those who are equally gifted academically, there are other options. You can combine a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience.<eos>"

Keeping the holiday-makers happy is a chalet girl's work. Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is a chalet girl. She works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets.

Sarah's day begins early. She gets up at 7 a.m. and prepares breakfast for the guests. After breakfast, she clears up and prepares the afternoon tea. She then goes on the slopes and skis as much as possible. Dinner is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone.

On Sundays, Sarah has a busy day. Work begins earlier than usual and she has to clean the place and prepare breakfast for the guests. After the guests have gone, she starts cleaning madly and does the week's shop. She then prepares tea for the new guests and takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends.<eos>"

On the rails, five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The journey is always enchanting, regardless of the weather or time of the year. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.

Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The journey was marred by one misfortune in his youth, missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park. Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express. Arisu Mezuki, an actress, was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life.<eos>"

Trying to get published? If you are thinking about writing and want to know where to send your story, Margaret Stubbs has some advice for you. To be successful, you need to research your markets, find out about publishers, and practice your writing skills. You also need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. To do this, you can read everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. So, keep writing and don't be discouraged.<eos>"

I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot of people waiting. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples with matching luggage and swarms of college kids. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He was well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. He was probably worried about his daughter. He was talking about his daughter and her passport. He said he had to stay with his wife because she was in a wheelchair. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet. It looked to be stapled shut. I said silently, ""Watch yourself, lady.""<eos>"

John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, a famous TV chef. Gary was given his chance to shine in the kitchen, and his dad ran a restaurant. When John heard about an opportunity, he rushed to look at the place. It was perfect for his business. John and his wife dedicated themselves to running the restaurant and raising their children. They lived over the restaurant and always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together.

Gary was a lively child who loved to cook. He started helping his dad in the kitchen at a young age. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there. He went to catering college and started his own business. Gary is successful and has a lot of talent. He's helped other people out and is proud of his accomplishments.

John is proud of his son and believes that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. He also thinks that if you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten per cent of what you've told them, you should be happy.<eos>"

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. If you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

She went to the flat and met a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf. The girl was coming down the stairs and said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent.

They offered her a mug of tea and she stayed for a while.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.

Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.

Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.<eos>"

Getting fit is essential for your mind, body and spirit. It's a great way to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It also improves the condition of your heart and lungs and blood circulation. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching is a great way to improve flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely.<eos>"

Kendra is very focused on her training. She said, ""My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships."" She is on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for the Championships.

The World Championships will be tough. There will be a lot of pressure on the England team. But Kendra is confident that they can win. She said, ""You don't do all that training not to come out a winner.""

Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players.""

As captain, Kendra has a strong mental attitude and leads by example. She said, ""From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned."" So she took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned.<eos>"

In hot water, Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time studying the chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

A dive can last for 16 hours. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released. No-one has tested it yet, but it would be a very unpleasant journey.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves.

The only time Rachel has been frightened is when she first went down with the Americans. There was an explosion and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" But she was still alive.

It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the underwater volcanoes, there is such a sense of wonder.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe our appearance, our eye contact, our body language and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our actual words.

Mary Pearce was a teacher who worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job because the Head Teacher thought she didn't fit the image of an office manager.

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language.

Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. If you are able to communicate clearly and concisely, you are more likely to make a good impression.<eos>"

More and more people are being born who are very tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors used to eat a wide variety of foods, but today we mostly eat three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to allow people to look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.

The damage to the drawings is increasing rapidly and there is a need to take action to preserve them for future generations.<eos>"

Going up the wall was once a challenge. Now it can be done anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also hosts the World Cup Climbing Championships. The fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. During the winter they would either tolerate the cold weather or go walking instead. As the sport developed, it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education, who constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University.

Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are flicked across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses have made a business out of their love for the game. They sell boards and they also hold championships. They have made more than 450 boards and they are available for $595 each.

Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. However, there are also some concerns about taking on this role. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?<eos>"

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival in Malaysia. He spends a nervous night in the forest. He met a man named Adnan Ali who showed him how to make kites. They sat down in the shade of the trees and looked out over the festival. The festival had a lot of kites and platforms. The kites flew into the air like rockets. There were a lot of people registered for the competition. Each person had entered four different designs. The competition ran for five days. Paul decided to stay in the forest for a night. He drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. He explored the southern half of the state and pointed his car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur. He took a wrong turn and ended up at a river. He took a boat across the river and walked up a steep path. He found a place to stay and spent the night. The next day he woke up and saw a beautiful view of the mountains. It rained and he got wet. He slid downhill and wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the drops. He was glad that his car was still there. He went back to Kota Bahru and talked to the people. He remembered Kelantan more for its human kindness than its kites.<eos>"

What kind of shopper are you? We all go shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers. Some people are addicted to shopping, while others are reluctant or even hate it.

There are different reasons why people shop differently. Some people, like Melanie and her boyfriend, enjoy shopping and spend a lot of money. Others, like Brenda, don't enjoy shopping and tend to feel guilty when they spend money. Still others, like Juliet, only shop for essentials. And there are those who, like Lisa, enjoy shopping but don't buy very much.

So, what kind of shopper are you? Take a look at the different types of shoppers and see which one you most identify with.<eos>"

For one group of children, aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are special. They learn the art of serious cooking in small classes. The lessons are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the north to the south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The climate can be bitterly cold because of its northerly location. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred meters up - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. They carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for their boots. The track soon climbed and their legs felt heavy. After seven hours of climbing, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. I was glad we had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have good eyesight and can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, unlike other fish, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. They were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world-famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. Each week after that, a new part of the hotel is completed until the hotel is finished. The finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Guests can wear warm clothes and socks inside the hotel, but they need to bring their own sweaters and scarves. If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.<eos>"

Tanya Streeter is a skilled free-diver who holds four world records in the sport of reaching extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath and coming back up without help. She has been deeper than that before, but on that occasion, she swam back up using a balloon. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man.

Tanya's training regimen is intense. She spends most of her time doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean.

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. In the 1970s, people thought that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. Not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

Although San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Today, San Francisco is a popular tourist destination. People come to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge.

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin and were worn during cold weather. Today, people still use leather, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a few hundred years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made in large factories using machines. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

When I injured my back, I had to take a break from running. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I started a running group for women in my area because I was annoyed by the lack of women in the sport and the lack of separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves.<eos>"

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the winter months, there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built. It was used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. It was agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead. The journey covered over 1,000 kilometres and took six days to complete. Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! Each band had their own costumes, some were black school uniforms like mine, and others were brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch - but even better when my band played on stage. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country - I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you.

The lessons are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''

In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists and wanted to put this light into his paintings. He painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.'

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It gives young people the opportunity to study for their exams and gain experience of life outside the classroom. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of those can attend because they receive government help. ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like. During the summer holidays my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister."" To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.<eos>"

I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. I was bored doing my job as a secretary and I was unhappy. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in the job. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who looked happy and carefree. However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. I also feel separated from the lecturers because I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying.<eos>"

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she went up the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!' When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.

Simplified text: 'Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When the weather gets colder, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are very cold in Canada, so the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found some young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the winter.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived, Bill flew to the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in the United States and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to the United States to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.'<eos>"

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters and socks with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present.

Most house burglaries happen between the afternoon and evening, say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also call the police if you see anything strange.<eos>"

The history of farming. Before people started farming, they had to go to the forest to find food. They moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses.

Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain.

Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much.

In London in the 18th century, there were no policemen. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night. About 300 years ago, London was growing bigger and dirtier. There were so many thieves that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Later, London became even bigger and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are well paid.

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we went to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest, but now they no longer work there. The cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are a few ways to the top. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero.

Everyone loves the panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is difficult to find food.

Dear Jeff, I'm having a good holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were all different here: red, yellow, purple. Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
