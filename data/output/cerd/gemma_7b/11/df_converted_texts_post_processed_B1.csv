In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish produced, people would have to buy less of just about everything.
A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference. If that's the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price."

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise your imagination and humour. If you do not have these skills, no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this problem, we need to rethink how work is defined and how it can be reconceived to suit us all. This means that we need to be able to design our own jobs, choose our own colleagues, and have more intimate conversations with our customers.
However, there are challenges to this. One challenge is that many employers are not willing to let their employees have too much autonomy. Another challenge is that traditional conversation skills are not always sufficient for the new kind of conversation that is needed in today's world.
Despite these challenges, I believe that we can all work towards a more fulfilling and meaningful work experience. By learning to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise our imagination and humour, we can all create a more positive and equitable world."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, which means that there are centralised resources intended and suited for spreading and reproduction.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is striking that it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising can play on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you're not as good as others. There are a lot of messages that tell us to buy, buy, buy.
Caves are a natural part of the environment. They are mysterious and interesting, so people have studied them for a long time. But you need to be physically fit to visit many caves. This means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere. People have been studying meteorology for centuries. Satellites and electronic instruments help us to learn about the weather.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily a theatre performance, while music comes first in an opera. Music is a powerful and expressive art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including listening to recordings, attending concerts, and performing. Theatre is also a powerful art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including watching plays, attending festivals, and participating in acting classes.
There are some similarities between music and theatre. For example, they both require skill and dedication. They also both have the ability to bring people together. And they both have the ability to inspire and entertain.
There are also some differences between music and theatre. For example, music is more focused on sound and rhythm, while theatre is more focused on acting and storytelling. Music is also more portable, while theatre is more confined to specific locations.
Overall, music and theatre are two complementary art forms that can enrich our lives in many ways. They can evoke a wide range of emotions, bring people together, and inspire and entertain."

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting content. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.
The studio lacked a focus. It had many disparate buildings and was difficult to navigate. To the mere stranger, it was all vastly confusing. But people who worked there could find their way about all right.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. I remember her as a lonely person who was always angry. She was also very possessive of her belongings. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked.
Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city."

I live on Philadelphia Avenue, on the odd-numbered side. The weather was cool and rainy when I went for a walk. I knew this side of the street well. There are a lot of houses and stores on my street. I used to play with my friends in these houses. The houses are different from each other. They have different porches and front yards. Over the years, there have been changes to the houses. The wooden porch banisters and pillars have been replaced by wrought iron. The stores have also changed. Some stores have become homes again. I like to swim in the pool. I swim up and down, and I nosed along. The best moments are when the storm intensifies. I want to swim through Britain. I want to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea.

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social function.

Sometimes, people cry involuntarily when they hear inspiring music or moving speeches. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues."

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Plants and animals are being affected by these changes, as well as water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.
Some of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in glacial processes, and rising sea levels. The consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe, with many people losing their homes and livelihoods.
It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. We also need to develop new technologies to help us adapt to the changing climate."

Aesthetics is a field that studies the theory of art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight.
Another reason is that the perfection of some artworks creates a sense of prestige and isolation. When artworks attain classic status, they become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.
In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.
The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events."

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.
There are a number of factors that have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult. These include the economic situation, the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take risks. Other events that have made it difficult to produce effective advertising include demographic changes, the rise of the retailer, and the changing needs and desires of consumers."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Reading and travel can escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed thanks to the influence of nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism. Fashion has a long history, dating back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have grown more complex, the variety of clothing and adornment has increased, and the meanings attached to dress have become more complex and significant. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people in different contexts. The novel gets written thanks to the generosity of those named in Acknowledgements and the ability to juggle part-time jobs and credit cards.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in national events and individual activities. It provides opportunities for learning and playing instruments, as well as for enjoyment. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can have positive effects on cognitive skills and social relationships. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the longer term, there are likely to be changes in the way music is listened to and performed. These changes will require a shift in focus for music education. In order to meet these changes, the music profession will need to adapt and evolve."

Blogging: Confessing to the World
Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people think about the downsides of sharing so much information on the internet.
The internet has a lot of opportunities for people to share their lives. You can write a blog, post photos, and share your stories with the world. But you should be careful because the water in the digital world is crowded and treacherous.

There are some things that scientists know about human sleep. Humans sleep according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness. Dreams occur during the lightest sleep.
However, there are also many theories about what sleep is for. Some scientists believe that sleep repairs body tissue or restores muscles. Others believe that sleep rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. There is no evidence to support these theories.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment and to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also been used to promote social and political change and development.
The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society.
Photography is regarded quite naturally as offering such convincing forms of pictorial evidence that this process of communication often seems to render the medium totally transparent, blurring the distinction between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations."

Poetry is like a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and careful. If you make a mistake, it can be a disaster. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination. You can also write to express your feelings or to tell a story. There are different ways to write poetry. You can write to a schedule, or you can wait for inspiration. The most important thing is to find your own style and to write with passion.
In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or a lot of unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they are necessary. Dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. It can reveal two sides of a question in less time than explaining it from only one person's viewpoint. Overwriting can kill a short story from the start. But brevity does not mean that you have to reduce the story to a synopsis. You need to sustain the conflict and action in a short story as well as in a novel.

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well, but I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in this story. I have also taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers. I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I have taken the liberty that historians have taken to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard. I have done this for the same reasons that the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted.

The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main approaches to studying animals. The physiological approach focuses on how the body works. The whole animal approach studies the behaviour of the intact animal. Within the whole animal approach, there are two main types of study: psychology and ethology.
The Social Sciences
Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance and methodology of the subject at the same time. Each social science discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts.
Classical Architecture
Classical architecture is more than just the construction of buildings. It is an art form that emphasizes aesthetics over function. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, the basic principles of classical architecture persisted into later sophisticated architectural concepts."

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line, shooting the bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had mastered this new skill. They went on a journey together. They drove to the English Channel and parked in a small street off the sea front. The sea was grey and the sky was clear. They looked at a ship. It was small and rusty. They put Man Kee on the eyepiece and showed him the ship. Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. The ship was gone. But Lily was still there. She put her arm around Husband's shoulders."

I had read that from a deep hole, one could see the stars. I persuaded you to help me with my plan. I climbed into the well and plunged. I cracked my head and fell into the well. I was scared and relieved. I saw lights and stars. I was angry at you for letting me fall. You called down and asked if I was all right. I lay still and waited for help. I was pulled out of the well and landed on the cobbles. I ran away and hid in the shadows. My mother and father appeared. My father was angry and said that I was being ridiculous. He walked away. I felt sorry for myself and worried about my future.

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. The egalitarian approach to book reviews on Amazon allowed anyone to say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars. This free-for-all system lent itself to mischief, but it also provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying."

Art in modern times, has become more and more popular over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we sometimes feel that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.
The artist chooses a piece of text in an art book and writes it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting.

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which was only afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia."

I chose this place to live because I thought I would find anonymity. But people in the shops soon start to recognise me. The roses in my neighbor's garden are a reminder that the gardens were loved once. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget that there is a summer going on out there, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying in the sky. I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, is leaning out of the window. She is a writer and I sometimes call upon her to read my essays. I have a copy of the latest in my possession now.

Heritage gives people a sense of connection to the past. It helps us understand and interpret our individual and national futures. It is a fundamental desire for continuity. It affects everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link with the past was through stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But, because Western industrial society broke up communities and families, much of that oral tradition has already been lost. Instead, places and architectural 'memories' give us clues to our past. It is vitally important to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.
Museums make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed - were used - had meaning - at some historical time. Museums which rise to the challenge and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.
Architecture and Environment
The desire to preserve things is not new. Change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it. Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it. Physical change, in other words, change in the environment provided by our towns, reflects social change - change in our numbers, in our welfare and in our demands."

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the need to be able to write clearly and concisely. It also follows that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.

I was at Easter Monday in Buccoo Village to witness goat racing. There were a lot of people and food stalls at the event. I had to fight my way through the crowds to get a good spot. A course was set up for the goats. It wasn't as impressive as established racecourses, but it was similar to the idea that people would line both sides of a stretch of ground where the participants would travel. The goats were being kept in order. It was difficult to control them because they could eat almost anything.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy."

We all get along well and help each other out. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Alfred Hitchcock was a film director who believed that the most important thing about his films was the photography and the soundtrack. He didn't care about the subject matter or the acting. Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, and unanswerable. He was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction, or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience."

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. There were few charts and catalogues and telescopes were limited. Today, there are many charts and telescopes available. Computers have made it easier to produce charts and analyze observations. All this makes this the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, there has also been a loss of privacy. Now one may have to travel a long distance to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours. This makes solar observations impossible and hampers night-time observation too.

Dr Johnson believed that writing without effort is generally read without pleasure. Good writing comes hard. Looking back at his handwritten school essays, the author was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today, he would have rewritten them five times over. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain and made the writing more careful.
The author also discussed the difference between books and electronic text. He argued that reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most people don't do it. The organization of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text rather than read it in its entirety.

In England, breakfast is a relatively new arrival. There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were wealthy. However, in the sixteenth century, it gradually became the norm to have breakfast. Some writers have suggested that this is because there was more food available. Others have suggested that it is because people started working earlier. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

These factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph. They also affect how people perceive and respond to the images.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed in maps varied with the purpose of the map and from place to place. In order to address the demands of different users, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions'."

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. She writes a hardback book of at least 20,000 words - with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.
The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. She writes other people's autobiographies, producing a hardback book of at least 20,000 words -- with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting.

We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond.
I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me.
I have never felt out of touch. Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.
I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting. I've noticed more and more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more conscious of the need to involve our children in our lives."

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea."

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.
The cubs were fed every four hours and grew quickly. After a few weeks, they were able to drink from a bottle and move around. They were very contented. However, one of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic and died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken by my failure, but fate worked in strange ways. Six days later, I found another male cub, Willow II, who was abandoned by his mother.
Willow II joined the fold and grew quickly. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages, he was ready to move on to something else.
The cubs are now eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hardboiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. They are also digging for earthworms. As 'human badgers', we often go for walks with the cubs in the evening. We see Primrose only occasionally, but Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night."

Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass. These variations, known as declination, are the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.
Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various locations, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland. From these travels, he published a chart that showed the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. His work was instrumental for seamen for more than a century.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate Halley's accomplishments. He aims to retrace Halley's route and conduct scientific measurements. The expedition, titled 'In the Wake of the Paramore,' will involve using precise instruments to measure declination and refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.
Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has extensive experience sailing and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He also has a strong motivation and determination to complete the expedition."

Peacocks that live at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks' tail is not necessarily an indicator of fitness. Wallace suggested that the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival. Now, researchers are trying to understand why peacocks have such elaborate trains. They are studying the relationship between the size of the train and the number of mates a peacock has. They are also looking at the health and growth of the offspring of peacocks with different sized trains. The results of this research could help us to understand better how peacocks have evolved and why they have such elaborate trains."

In the past few million years, humans have not developed any significant differences from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps genetically. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities between humans and animals exist. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. Monkeys also have a simple one-word language. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it is strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.
There are three main distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, while animal activities are mostly utilitarian. Second, human art is made for aesthetic pleasure, while animal activities are often made for survival or reproduction. Third, human art is learned, while animal activities are instinctive.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale.
There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialize in them. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life.
Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The team was composed of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese, 30 camels and six camel handlers.
The team suffered unspeakable hardships, but they managed to find water and survive. They walked for 1,000 kilometres and were very thin and muscular despite their physical exhaustion.
Blackmore went on to describe lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. He felt prouder of that expedition than of anything else he'd done."

It makes life easier and leaves us with more time to do other things.

Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.

It is the desire to be unique and to do things differently from others. Most of us have our own quirks and oddities.

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played off the board as well as on it. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire."

Volunteer tourism is a topic that four academic writers discuss. It can be a positive or negative experience. On the one hand, volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks. It can also raise awareness of existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty. On the other hand, volunteer tourism can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development. It can also bypass the democratic imperative of representative government and reduce development to individual acts of charity.
Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty. However, volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble 'making a difference', can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate."

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The number of spines a hedgehog has affects its ability to defend itself. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so.

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is also fragmented because brands and media have proliferated. As a result, most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised.
Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. The most cost-effective way to reach the relevant minority is to use mass media, but if advertising is to get going again its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before."

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed to be energy-efficient and sustainable. It uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles its sewage into garden compost, and heats the house with waste heat from electrical appliances and its own body heat. The house is also super-insulated with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows. There is a monastic stillness inside the house. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. The house has a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales claim not to use except in the very coldest winter. So is it warm in winter? One night in February when I happened to call on him, Robert was sitting reading. It was too warm to light the fire, he said. The room temperature on the first floor was 18C, less than the generally expected temperature of living areas, but entirely comfortable, he claimed, because there are no draughts, no radiant heat loss.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered."

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been making weapons, armour and farming tools since the beginning of time. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but they are still admired for their artistry.
There has been a recent revival in blacksmithing thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Artists now have a new material that allows them to express themselves more freely. The metal is soft when it is hot, but it becomes rigid and immovable when it cools down.
Many blacksmiths are fascinated by the unique properties of iron. They love the fact that it is cold and hard, and the way it feels as though it is there forever. No other base metal can give man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security."

Dorothy Hodgkin was a British woman scientist who won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1964 for her work on penicillin and vitamin B12. She was also a mother of three and wife to a historian.
Hodgkin's most important successes were solving the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12. She pushed the technique into realms of complexity others deemed unreachable at the time.
There is much to learn from Hodgkin's life. She was a successful scientist and a loving mother. Her story is an inspiration to all."

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense' that allows her to locate water. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. Once she has found the likely areas, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the stick rises up. If there is no water, the stick does not rise up.
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed.
B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!
C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. But I dithered for ages about how to look. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials. Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.
D. Hilary's story I arrived at the farm early, but I discovered that Rosemary had been up for hours. The process of milking the cows took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day."

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born in southern Sweden and has a unique talent for playing the trumpet. His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers, but new works too.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. He had a natural talent for playing the trumpet and was taught by a teacher who was also passionate about the instrument.
Hardenberger has a unique gift of communicating through his music. He is able to move people with his playing. He has won many competitions and has performed in many concert halls around the world."

Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.
A good leader is one who inspires, motivates, and encourages others. Leadership is not about height or intelligence. It's about making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are. To be a good leader, you should be able to speak out clearly and confidently. You should also be able to motivate others and inspire them to believe in themselves.
Becoming a leader is recognizing your latent talents and developing them. It's also about setting goals and achieving them. If you want to be a successful leader, you need to be willing to take risks and learn from your mistakes. You also need to be able to communicate effectively and delegate tasks.
Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. There are definite lessons to be learned. Find out where your passions and convictions lie. Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Set goals and achieve them. Be visible and accessible to those who are important. But bear in mind, you don't have to lead all the time."

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but it also means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.
The sales of print newspapers are plummeting while visits to their websites keep on soaring. The latest print circulation figures show that many newspapers are down between 8% and 10% year-on-year. However, the latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference.
The decline in newspaper sales is a complex issue. There are many factors that contribute to it, including timing, demography, geography, and the rise of e-readers. However, the evidence suggests that print is still a valuable tool for newspapers. It is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions.
Of course, the decline in newspaper sales is a challenge for newspaper companies. However, there are a number of things that newspapers can do to adapt to the changing landscape. One thing that newspapers can do is to offer joint packages that include print and digital access. Another thing that newspapers can do is to focus on providing high-quality content."

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.
To photograph people well, you need to consider the following:
- Group people at different angles and distances.
- Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
- Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
- Ask your subject to look into the lens.
- Use a background that is relevant to the subject.
- Show the interaction between people.
- Take pictures of people in their natural environment.
- Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting.
- Decide whether you want to pose or not pose your subject."

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although it is easier to capture newsworthy events with digital cameras and camera phones, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, there is ongoing debate about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that a significant number of people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to maintain its relationship with the public, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received the most attention.
Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can experience pain.
Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.
If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you."

She became 'quite accustomed' to seeing corpses while working in forensic science. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. It was the shape and construction involved in the writing of a crime novel that appealed to her.

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.
Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether a person is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them."

The air pressure in the polar regions is lower, which has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.
C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)
The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges instead.
E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)
When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality.

Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out.

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The river threatened us most. It was flowing wildly and was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. The dam held and the waters began to subside. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley.

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because it's fun. Teenager with a taste for endurance WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). Ability to do all three without a rest essential. The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping. Great for those watching, maybe, but what makes the triathletes want to punish their bodies so much? And what makes an attractive 17-year-old, with excellent academic results, give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers?
Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes automatically use when asked similar questions. 'You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 1Okm, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,' she says.
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. 'I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went round.' Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. 'I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realised then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the running.' But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. 'Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again.' Such doggedness draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. 'I've just been testing her fitness,' he says, 'and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realise they can't go any further, she just kept on.'
Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with PS1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.'"

The Collectors
Amanda Roy writes about her passion for collecting and the reasons why people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. If you enter this world, remember one thing: you must fall in love with an object before you collect it. People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. Others collect flowers, pottery or paintings. If you are interested in collecting, there are many things you can collect. You do not have to be rich or powerful to start a collection. You can collect items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. As small objects become a popular collector's item, they begin to rise in price."

No title. We always go to Ireland in June. Every year, the four of us have spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds bought the house and have added to it. They have a lot of flowers in the hall. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, Mrs. Malseed sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.
In the morning, we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape."

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.
Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and remembering that it wasn't about passing or failing. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and they will produce a report giving their observations and recommendations.
If you are considering changing your career, you should think about the pros and cons of each option. You may need to weigh the cost of retraining against your financial commitments. If you have no idea what you want to do, you can go to a careers adviser and they can help you find the right path."

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch. Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist when they're not in pain. To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. He has introduced relaxation techniques such as virtual-reality headsets and a pleasant smell in the surgery. The surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. The quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847. Today, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week."

Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, have travelled from Canada to Africa to find gold. They believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain a lot of gold. After ten years of digging, they are convinced that they are close to a vein of gold worth millions of dollars.
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read about a pocket of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the Welsh town of Dolgellau. Since they first found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.
Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put money into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.

I was dirty, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was tired of foreign timetables, currencies and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel freely throughout Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The system works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a specific time before departure. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are designed to allow for baggage transfers. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic can cause delays. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport."

A child who shows outstanding musical ability may need a special understanding and education. There are five music schools in Britain that provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. These schools offer a range of musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also provide a restricted academic programme, which concentrates on the essential subjects.
The disadvantages of attending a specialist music school include the cost and the need to board away from home. It may also be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education.
For those who are equally gifted academically, there are other options. You can combine a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Trying to get published? If you are thinking about writing and want to know where to send your story, Margaret Stubbs has some advice for you. To be successful, you need to research your markets, find out about publishers, and practice your writing skills. You also need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. To do this, you can read everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. So, keep writing and don't be discouraged."

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.
The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.
Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.
Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand."

Getting fit is essential for your mind, body and spirit. It's a great way to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It also improves the condition of your heart and lungs and blood circulation. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching is a great way to improve flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely."

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language.

Parents also admit they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict.

Where I get my energy, Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the full to tell us how they do it. They said that doing things you enjoy and feeling positive about life gives you energy. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even though you may be feeling tired. To get energy, you can do things that make you feel good, such as dancing, exercising, or spending time in nature. You also need to get enough sleep and eat a healthy diet.

Chris Greener was tall when he was fourteen, and he is still the tallest man in Britain today. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. More and more people are being born who are very tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors used to eat a wide variety of foods, but today we mostly eat three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people. However, the fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

Studio audiences are a common feature of television life. They are made up of people from all classes, professions and income groups. People often go to studio audiences to appear on television, take a look behind the scenes, or simply have fun.
When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.
Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

We love animals. One day, my daughter found a pine snake. We decided to keep it overnight. I was late getting home and when I arrived, there was a crisis. Domino the cat and Bianca the mouse were running around the bedroom. I tried to help, but I tripped over something and fell on the floor. The snake escaped and I was scared. I crouched like a rabbit and the snake was hissing and striking at me. I managed to capture Domino and pull the mouse from its jaws. I looked the snake over for weak points, but it didn't have any. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer and the snake relaxed. I eventually released the snake and it went away.

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of the contents. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. When I left home to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. I also write to my family and friends in Sri Lanka and France. I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.
The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.
Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to allow people to look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.
The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.
The damage to the drawings is increasing rapidly and there is a need to take action to preserve them for future generations."

Going up the wall was once a challenge. Now it can be done anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also hosts the World Cup Climbing Championships. The fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. During the winter they would either tolerate the cold weather or go walking instead. As the sport developed, it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education, who constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University.

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are playing a game called pichenotte. It is a game that their grandfather brought to the USA from Canada. The game is popular in their family and they often play it on weekends and holidays.
Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are flicked across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
The Lagasses have made a business out of their love for the game. They sell boards and they also hold championships. They have made more than 450 boards and they are available for $595 each.
The Lagasses are happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune."

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when their private moments are captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. However, there are also some concerns about taking on this role. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully.

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival in Malaysia. He spends a nervous night in the forest. He met a man named Adnan Ali who showed him how to make kites. They sat down in the shade of the trees and looked out over the festival. The festival had a lot of kites and platforms. The kites flew into the air like rockets. There were a lot of people registered for the competition. Each person had entered four different designs. The competition ran for five days. Paul decided to stay in the forest for a night. He drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. He explored the southern half of the state and pointed his car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur. He took a wrong turn and ended up at a river. He took a boat across the river and walked up a steep path. He found a place to stay and spent the night. The next day he woke up and saw a beautiful view of the mountains. It rained and he got wet. He slid downhill and wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the drops. He was glad that his car was still there. He went back to Kota Bahru and talked to the people. He remembered Kelantan more for its human kindness than its kites."

What kind of shopper are you? We all go shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers. Some people are addicted to shopping, while others are reluctant or even hate it.
There are different reasons why people shop differently. Some people, like Melanie and her boyfriend, enjoy shopping and spend a lot of money. Others, like Brenda, don't enjoy shopping and tend to feel guilty when they spend money. Still others, like Juliet, only shop for essentials. And there are those who, like Lisa, enjoy shopping but don't buy very much.
So, what kind of shopper are you? Take a look at the different types of shoppers and see which one you most identify with."
