In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people should pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste.
However, the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet."

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise your imagination and humour. If you do not have these skills, no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this problem, we need to rethink how work is defined and how it can be reconceived to suit us all. This means that we need to be able to design our own jobs, choose our own colleagues, and have more intimate conversations with our customers.
However, there are challenges to this. One challenge is that many employers are not willing to let their employees have too much autonomy. Another challenge is that traditional conversation skills are not always sufficient for the new kind of conversation that is needed in today's world.
Despite these challenges, I believe that we can all work towards a more fulfilling and meaningful work experience. By learning to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise our imagination and humour, we can all create a more positive and equitable world."

Broadcasting is a technology that is used to spread seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, it is striking that it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
In the early 1930s, there were two little-known, distinct alternatives to the way television was organised. One was experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone. The other was various popular science journals that had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers.
But the dominant organisation of broadcasting was based on the need to reach all citizens with important information efficiently. It was also a highly useful instrument in the production of the harmonising, stabilising 'imagined community' of the nation-state."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can be very persuasive, and it can make you feel like you need things that you don't. To see how much you're influenced, I challenge you to not read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.
Caves are a natural part of the environment that have been studied for many years. They are mysterious and fascinating, and they have attracted a lot of research. However, exploring caves can be physically demanding, so cave research has been less in the hands of academics than other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere. It's been around for centuries, and it's become a very technical science.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily a theatre performance, while music comes first in an opera. Music is a powerful and expressive art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including listening to recordings, attending concerts, and performing. Theatre is also a powerful art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including watching plays, attending festivals, and participating in acting classes.
There are some similarities between music and theatre. For example, they both require skill and dedication. They also both have the ability to bring people together. And they both have the ability to inspire and entertain.
There are also some differences between music and theatre. For example, music is more focused on sound and rhythm, while theatre is more focused on acting and storytelling. Music is also more portable, while theatre is more confined to specific locations.
Overall, music and theatre are two complementary art forms that can enrich our lives in many ways. They can evoke a wide range of emotions, bring people together, and inspire and entertain."

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting content. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. As a child, I had some notion of the oddity of her personality. She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate.
Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.
If I remember anything about these early years it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught occasional glimpses of the world that existed outside West Earlham. Mercenary motives were a familiar theme of my mother's conversation, and politicians my mother held in the deepest contempt of all."

I also like to swim because it allows me to get away from everything else. It is a very relaxing activity.

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Plants and animals are being affected by these changes, as well as water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.
Some of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in glacial processes, and rising sea levels. The consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe, with many people losing their homes and livelihoods.
It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. We also need to develop new technologies to help us adapt to the changing climate."

Aesthetics is a field that studies the theory of art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This makes it difficult to understand the meaning of artistic products. Additionally, the perfection of some artworks creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When artworks are isolated from their original conditions and human consequences, they become difficult to understand. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour."

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, despite the challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.
There are a number of factors that have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult. These include the economic situation, the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take risks. Other events that have made it difficult to produce effective advertising include demographic changes, the rise of the retailer, and the changing needs and desires of consumers."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Reading and travel can escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed thanks to the influence of capitalism. Fashion has a long history, dating back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is used in many different ways, including national events, individual activities, and education. It can also have a positive impact on our well-being. For example, playing an instrument can improve concentration, social skills, and spatial reasoning. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can help to develop transferable skills such as punctuality and organization. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. However, in the long term, there may be a shift in focus and the need for instrumental teaching may decline. If this vision of the future is to be realised, the music profession will need to adapt to meet the changing demands of the population."

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment and to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also been used to promote social and political change and development.
The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Poetry is like a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and careful. If you make a mistake, it can be a disaster. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination.

The most important thing is to find your own style and to write with passion.
In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or a lot of unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story. Dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. It can reveal two sides of a question in less time than explaining it from only one person's viewpoint. Overwriting can kill a short story. But brevity doesn't mean that you have to reduce the story to a synopsis. You need to sustain the conflict and action in a short story as well as in a novel.

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well. I have little knowledge of what happened to him between the times I saw him. I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in the story. I have also taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.

Oral History
The trend of historians relying on oral evidence has its challenges. It is difficult to believe that someone's testimony accurately represents the past, because in an interview, each person is influenced by the other. The historian chooses the informant and indicates the area of interest, and even if they do not ask any questions and simply listen, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. To be a good historian, you must accept responsibility for your part in creating new evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main approaches to studying animals - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body works, while those taking the 'whole animal' approach study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it. Although there is some overlap, there is a distinction between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists work in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, while ethologists study the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals.
The Social Sciences
If you are studying a social science for the first time, you have to do two things at once. You must familiarize yourself with the substance or content of your new subject and learn the methodology of the subject. That is, you must become familiar with the knowledge and research findings which fill the textbooks but also with the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised.
Classical Architecture
Classical architecture was much more than just the construction of buildings. It was an art form. The origins of classical architecture are complex, but the basic idea is that architecture is about aesthetics and form. The classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut."

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line, shooting the bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had mastered this new skill. They went on a journey together. They drove to the English Channel and parked in a small street off the sea front. The sea was grey and the sky was clear. They looked at a ship. It was small and rusty. They put Man Kee on the eyepiece and showed him the ship. Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. The ship was gone. But Lily was still there. She put her arm around Husband's shoulders."

Art in modern times, has become more and more popular over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we sometimes feel that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both.

It also follows that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.

I was at Easter Monday in Buccoo Village to witness goat racing. There were a lot of people and food stalls at the event. I had to fight my way through the crowds to get a good spot. A course was set up for the goats. It wasn't as big as a regular racecourse, but it was similar to the idea that people would line both sides of a track. The goats were being kept in order. It was difficult to control them because they could eat almost anything.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy."

I have been welcomed warmly to a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very isolated place. There are a lot of people living there, but I don't have much trouble communicating. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely, or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past fifty years. There were not many charts and catalogues, and telescopic equipment was limited. Today, there are many more charts and catalogues, and telescopes are more accessible. Computers have made it easier to analyze observations and publish results. All this makes this a good time for amateur astronomy.
However, there has also been a loss of simplicity. Now you have to travel farther to find a sky that is comparable to the sky in urban areas fifty years ago. The daytime skies are now filled with aircraft condensation trails which can last for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Dr Johnson believed that writing without effort is generally read without pleasure. Good writing comes hard. Looking back at his handwritten school essays, the author was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today, he would have rewritten them five times over. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain and made the writing more careful.
The author also discussed the difference between books and electronic text. He argued that reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most people don't do it. The organization of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text rather than read it in its entirety.
The author's friend, Kathleen, tried to convince him to use computers. She argued that he was adept at computers and had even published an important paper on computer-mode giftedness. But the author was not convinced. He felt that computers were not conducive to joined-up thinking and that reading books was a more enjoyable experience."

In England, breakfast is a relatively new arrival. There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were wealthy. However, in the sixteenth century, it gradually became the norm to have breakfast. Some writers have said that this is because there was more food available. Others have said that it is because people started working earlier. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content. The development of cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. Today, cartographers have to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions', from geological strata and climatic regimes to land use."

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea."

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.
The cubs were fed every four hours and grew quickly. After a few weeks, they were able to drink from a bottle and move around. They were very contented. However, one of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic and died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken by my failure, but fate worked in strange ways. Six days later, I found another male cub, Willow II, who was abandoned by his mother.
Willow II joined the fold and grew quickly. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages, he was ready to move on to something else.
The cubs are now eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hardboiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. They are also digging for earthworms. As 'human badgers', we often go for walks with the cubs in the evening. We see Primrose only occasionally, but Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night."

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans. Halley's journey was the first dedicated scientific expedition on the seas. He became the first civilian who was appointed naval captain to pursue what many regarded as an obsession with declination.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's voyage. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews. Dr. Clark is prepared to give up his life for eight months to do this. He believes that Halley's accomplishments deserve to be celebrated."

Peacocks that live at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. According to Darwin, the fittest individuals are the most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks' tail was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.
The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are trying to find out if the peacocks with the showiest trains also have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
The results of their research could help to settle the debate between Darwin and Wallace about the peacocks' tails. If the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways, then the females' choice will be seen to be utilitarian after all, just as Wallace predicted."

The boat was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. It has a lot of old-fashioned boat design features, but also has the benefits of modern technology. The boat has a coal stove for warmth and dryness, cosy berths for sleeping, and a lot of storage space.
However, the boat also has some drawbacks. It is difficult to sail and it is expensive to maintain. But for Cunliffe, the boat is worth it. He loves sailing and he is happy that he was able to build his own boat."

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes.
Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many attributes once considered uniquely human are also used by animals. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.
There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialize in them. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life.
Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The team was composed of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese, 30 camels and six camel handlers.
The team suffered unspeakable hardships, but they managed to find water and survive. They walked for 1,000 kilometres and were very thin and muscular despite their physical exhaustion.
Blackmore went on to describe lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. He felt prouder of that expedition than of anything else he'd done."

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played off the board as well as on it. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire."

Volunteer tourism is a topic that four academic writers discuss. It can be a positive or negative experience. On the one hand, volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks. It can also raise awareness of existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty. On the other hand, volunteer tourism can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development. It can also bypass the democratic imperative of representative government and reduce development to individual acts of charity.
Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty. However, volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble 'making a difference', can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate."

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The number of spines a hedgehog has affects its ability to defend itself. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so.

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is also fragmented because brands and media have proliferated. As a result, most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised.
Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. The most cost-effective way to reach the relevant minority is to use mass media, but if advertising is to get going again its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before."

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie.

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have been making weapons, armour and farming tools. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but they are still admired for their artistry.
There has been a recent revival of blacksmithing. This is due to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.
No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good."

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again.
C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. It was a lonely day. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He was born in southern Sweden and has a unique talent for playing the trumpet. His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers, but new works too.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo and owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing.
Hardenberger has a gift for finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre.
Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. He is a thoughtful and humble musician who is passionate about his work."

New In Paperback A is a novel set in the fictional republic of Efica. The book is notable for its humour, and for the author's unique vision. It also includes a story about a teenage boy who viciously attacked a young man. After the court case, both boys refuse to talk about what happened. The book follows the fortunes of one of the most isolated of the Scottish Orkney islands and its inhabitants over a long and uneventful rural history. The book also includes a story about a woman who approaches her seventies with her spirited companion.
The author is skillful at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events."

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but it also means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.
The sales of print newspapers are plummeting while visits to their websites keep on soaring. The latest print circulation figures show that many newspapers are down between 8% and 10% year-on-year. However, the latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference.
The decline in newspaper sales is a complex issue. There are many factors that contribute to it, including timing, demography, geography, and the rise of e-readers. However, the evidence suggests that print is still a valuable tool for newspapers. It is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions.
Of course, the decline in newspaper sales is a challenge for newspaper companies. However, there are a number of things that newspapers can do to adapt to the changing landscape. One thing that newspapers can do is to offer joint packages that include print and digital access. Another thing that newspapers can do is to focus on providing high-quality content."

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.
To photograph people well, you need to consider the following:
- Group people at different angles and distances.
- Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
- Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
- Ask your subject to look into the lens.
- Use a background that is relevant to the subject.
- Show the interaction between people.
- Take pictures of people in their natural environment.
- Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting.
- Decide whether you want to pose or not pose your subject."

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although it is easier to capture newsworthy events with digital cameras and camera phones, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, there is debate about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that a significant number of people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received the most attention.
Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. These points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can experience pain.
Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.
If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you."

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.
Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether a person is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them."

Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out.

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. And then it happened - the reservoir overflowed. The river seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because it's fun. Teenager with a taste for endurance WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). Ability to do all three without a rest essential. The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping. Great for those watching, maybe, but what makes the triathletes want to punish their bodies so much? And what makes an attractive 17-year-old, with excellent academic results, give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers?
Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes automatically use when asked similar questions. 'You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 1Okm, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,' she says.
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. 'I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went round.' Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. 'I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realised then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the running.' But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. 'Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again.' Such doggedness draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. 'I've just been testing her fitness,' he says, 'and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realise they can't go any further, she just kept on.'
Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with PS1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.'"

The Collectors
Amanda Roy writes about her passion for collecting and the reasons why people enjoy this hobby. Many adults indulge in collecting, which is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. If you enter this world, remember one thing: you must fall in love with an object before you collect it. People have been collecting objects since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. Others collect flowers, pottery or paintings. If you are interested in collecting, you can start small. You do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. You can collect items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. As small objects become popular collector's items, they begin to rise in price."

On Sunday, she starts cleaning madly and prepares tea for the new guests. Sometimes she is disorientated and full of questions. After tea and dinner, she takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and gets a lift back to the chalet. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. Sometimes she's so tired she just has an early night."

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.
Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and remembering that it wasn't about passing or failing. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and they will produce a report giving their observations and recommendations.
If you are considering changing your career, you should think about the pros and cons of each option. You may need to weigh the cost of retraining against your financial commitments. If you have no idea what you want to do, you can go to a careers adviser and they can help you find the right path."

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch. Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist when they're not in pain. To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. He has introduced relaxation techniques such as virtual-reality headsets and a pleasant smell in the surgery. The surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. The quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847. Today, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week."

Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, have travelled from Canada to Africa to find gold. They believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain a lot of gold. After ten years of digging, they are convinced that they are close to a vein of gold worth millions of dollars.
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read about a pocket of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the Welsh town of Dolgellau. Since they started digging, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth, and removing old cars and rubbish.
Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put money into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

I was dirty, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was tired of foreign timetables, currencies and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel freely throughout Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The system works like this. Airlines require you to check in at a specific time before your flight. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are designed to allow for baggage transfers. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic can cause delays. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport."

A child who shows outstanding musical ability may need a special understanding and education. There are five music schools in Britain that provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. These schools offer a range of musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also provide a restricted academic programme, which concentrates on the essential subjects.
The disadvantages of attending a specialist music school include the cost and the need to board away from home. It may also be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make their own decisions before considering a specialist education.
For those who are equally gifted academically, there are other options. You can combine a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The journey is always enchanting, regardless of the weather or time of the year. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.
Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed many rail journeys through the years, but if he had to pick a favourite, it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The journey was filled with misfortune, but it was also a memorable one. Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. The journey was filled with love and happiness. Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. The train journey was unreliable and dangerous, but it was also a dream-like experience. Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case.

If you want to get your story published, there are a few things you need to know. First, you need to research your market and find out about publishers. You also need to practice your writing skills. To become a successful writer, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. You can do this by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.
Once you have researched your market and improved your writing skills, you can start sending your work to publishers. However, it is important to remember that most new writers are not successful. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. Don't be discouraged if your work is rejected. Just keep writing and eventually you will be successful."

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.
The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.
Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.
Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand."

Getting fit is essential for your mind, body and spirit. It's a great way to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It also improves the condition of your heart and lungs and blood circulation. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching is a great way to improve flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely."

Chris Greener was tall when he was fourteen. He is the tallest man in Britain today. Every decade, people in Europe grow taller. More and more people are born big. This does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of plants and fruits. But today, we eat mostly three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

Studio audiences are a common feature of television life. They are made up of people from all classes, professions and income groups. People often go to studio audiences to appear on television, take a look behind the scenes, or simply have fun.
When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.
Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

We love animals. One day, my daughter found a pine snake. We decided to keep it overnight. I was late getting home and when I arrived, there was a crisis. Domino the cat and Bianca the mouse were running around the bedroom. I tried to help, but I tripped over something and fell on the floor. The snake escaped and I was scared. I crouched like a rabbit and the snake was hissing and striking at me. I managed to capture Domino and pull the mouse from its jaws. I looked the snake over for weak points, but it didn't have any. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer and the snake relaxed. I eventually released the snake and it went away.

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of the contents.
I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mother when I was young, and I still write to her today. I also write to my friends and penfriends.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but I prefer to have a year's supply of news. And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps.
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition of letter writing. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother.
I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 'lost art'."

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.
The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.
Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to allow people to look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.
The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.
The drawings are an important part of French history and should be preserved for future generations. If we do not take steps to protect them, they will be lost forever."

Young shoppers often go to the supermarket with their parents. Sometimes, they want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents sometimes have a hard time deciding which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. They also admit they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas."

Going up the wall was once a challenge. Now it can be done anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, a climber named Francois Lombard is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also hosts the World Cup Climbing Championships. The fact that either event is possible is due to a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. During the winter, they would either tolerate the cold weather or go walking instead. As the sport developed, climbers needed to keep fit. They used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls had obvious design problems. They could only be built in a vertical plane. There was also the added drawback that once the walls were up, they couldn't be altered. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny developed a material that could be moulded into shapes like those that climbers would find on the cliffs. This material could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination."

If you want to become an actor, it's a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs. If you choose to become an actor, people may tell you you're crazy. But it's a personal choice and only you can take responsibility for yourself. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You need luck and talent. There is a demand for new faces and new talent. Acting is all about making contact with the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted. Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. You need to be prepared for rejection. If you don't care enough, no-one will care for you."

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are playing a game called pichenotte. It is a game that their grandfather brought to the USA from Canada. The game is popular in their family and they often play it on weekends and holidays.
Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are flicked across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
The Lagasses have made a business out of their love for the game. They sell boards and they also hold championships. They have made more than 450 boards and they are available for $595 each.

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, pictures of individuals in the public eye are taken without their consent and published on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. However, there are also some concerns about taking on this role. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?"

Others, like Brenda, don't enjoy shopping and tend to feel guilty when they spend money. Still others, like Juliet, only shop for essentials. And there are those who, like Lisa, enjoy shopping but don't buy very much.

The lessons are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency."

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her parents that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She started making clothes for herself and her friends. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. Her clothes were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job and begin her own womenswear label. Her parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over PS500,000.

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the north to the south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't particularly interesting. But at dawn on the third day we reached the foothills of an area close to the Southern Ocean. My journey was over."

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The climate can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. You need spikes for your boots because the snow is very hard. The track soon climbed and the legs felt heavy. After seven hours of climbing, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye.

When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely. The manager of CityBus called me and said they had my handbag. He offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day."

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have good eyesight and can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, unlike other fish, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. I was nervous at my first ballet class because I didn't know anyone. Everyone was talking in Russian, but I managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me and I understand my teachers. The classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. I feel confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. They were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. Each week after that, a new part of the hotel is completed until the hotel is finished. The finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Guests can wear warm clothes and socks inside the hotel, but they need to bring their own sweaters and scarves. If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

Last Thursday, a new furniture shop called Homestyle opened at midnight. Many people rushed to the shop to take advantage of the special offers. There were lots of people waiting in line to get into the shop. The shop was soon full and the managers decided to close the doors. Some people became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop. This meant that the road was completely blocked. One customer, Jenny Smith, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.'"

Tanya Streeter is a skilled free-diver who holds four world records. She is known for her ability to reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath. She has also broken the world record for the longest time spent holding your breath.
Tanya's training regimen is intense. She spends most of her time doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart, but she doesn't run because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness.
When Tanya is not training, she makes frequent public appearances, mainly to advertise sports products. She has also supported environmental organisations. As for the future, Tanya says she plans to keep breaking her own world records."

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. In the 1970s, people thought that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. Not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

HONEY Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit many flowers to produce honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. There are more than three hundred varieties of honey. The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food. It was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Honey is good for you. It can prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can also be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products.

Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years.

There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott joining the band on bass guitar and Tom Simpson on drums. The first song on the CD is a dance tune, and the second song is also a dance tune. Most of the remaining songs are in the band's more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. They could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has unfortunately rented in the band having to cancel their next tour."

The bay is a beautiful natural harbour. Although it was discovered by land, people often travel to San Francisco by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms. They built large houses on one of the hills called Nob Hill. Nowadays, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many people also take a boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin and were worn during cold weather. Today, people still use leather, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a few hundred years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made in large factories using machines. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

When I injured my back, I had to take a break from running. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I started a running group for women in my area because I was annoyed by the lack of women in the sport and the lack of separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves."

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. In the winter, there was no way to get to the towns by boat or plane. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.

The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west, but lie only a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, a city that is known for its beautiful scenery and friendly people. Standing with its feet in the water and its head in the mountains, this city allows its residents to ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city centre. There are a few passenger trains that run from Vancouver on the cross- continent railway. The ride is still a great adventure. You sleep on board, which is fun, but travel through some of the best scenery at night.

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! Each band had their own costumes. We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country - I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history.

But, as many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is always welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food.

The lessons are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It gives young people the opportunity to study for their exams and gain experience of life outside the classroom. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of those can attend because they receive government help. ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like."" To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work."

I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in the job. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who looked happy, carefree and full of hope. However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. I also feel separated from the lecturers because I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying."

After he had driven it a long way, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T'. It was a cheap car. He was soon selling a lot of cars. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.
