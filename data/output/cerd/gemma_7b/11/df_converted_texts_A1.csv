In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people should pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste.

However, the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that is used to spread seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

Television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s. As such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry. In fact, television was throughout the 19030s predominantly watched in public settings also outside of the USA.

As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily a theatre performance, while music comes first in an opera. Music is a powerful and expressive art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including listening to recordings, attending concerts, and performing. Theatre is also a powerful art form that can evoke a wide range of emotions. It can be enjoyed in many different ways, including watching plays, attending festivals, and participating in acting classes.

There are some similarities between music and theatre. For example, they both require skill and dedication. They also both have the ability to bring people together. And they both have the ability to inspire and entertain.

There are also some differences between music and theatre. For example, music is more focused on sound and rhythm, while theatre is more focused on acting and storytelling. Music is also more portable, while theatre is more confined to specific locations.

Overall, music and theatre are two complementary art forms that can bring joy and inspiration to people of all ages.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film usually involves reducing, condensing and deleting. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating.

In those days, there were many council houses in West Earlham. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked down the street. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other memories of my mother and her cronies. They formed a depressed and depressing sisterhood. My mother was a solitary person and she had a lot of rules for me. She was always telling me to behave properly. I remember her stopping once in front of a fine study of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to remark, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!'

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather and the planet. The changes to climate will have a significant impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system and the effects of climate change. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

Climate change has the potential to affect the geographical locations of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands, and the mix of species they contain. It also has the potential to affect food production, water resources and human settlements.

The most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe.<eos>"

Aesthetics is a theory that deals with the understanding and insight of art. However, the existence of art products has become an obstacle to theory about them. This is because these products exist externally and physically, and they often become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.

In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.

The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events.<eos>"

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s were probably the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. In Britain, it meant that a lot of people lost their jobs and homes. Every single business in the country was affected. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as the ones who are spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, there has also been a rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The fact is that companies should be making sure they are producing services and goods that their customers want, as opposed to merely what it is convenient for them to provide.

And, generally, in the absence of concrete, convincing and quantitative evidence to the contrary, clients have to conclude that the benefits of advertising might be questionable.<eos>"

Music has become an integral part of our lives. In the past, there has been a significant increase in the opportunities to listen to music through various technologies. However, this has come at the expense of a decline in live music performance and employment opportunities for professional musicians. Despite the challenges, music continues to fulfill numerous human needs and is an integral part of many national and individual events.

The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skill and talent are essential for various professions, particularly those related to the media. Additionally, playing an instrument has been shown to have numerous benefits, including improved spatial reasoning, social relationships, and concentration.

In the future, there are likely to be changes in the way we listen to and make music. New genres of music will emerge, and technology will play an increasingly important role in composition and performance. As a result, there will be an increased demand for music lessons, particularly for younger children and those with behavioral difficulties.

To ensure the continued success of music education, the focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways must be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments throughout their life span. This will require a broader curriculum and the training of musicians who are able to motivate, inspire, and teach learners of all ages.<eos>"

However, there are also a lot of theories about what sleep is for. Some people believe that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity.

Kinetic art is a type of art that is concerned with movement. A new exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London traces the history of kinetic art in the twentieth century. The exhibition reveals that making artworks that move or investigate the idea of movement has been a consistent theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. Visitors are free to make connections and discoveries for themselves without being bothered by explanations.

The exhibition includes works by David Hockney, a popular artist who is known for his figurative paintings and drawings. Hockney's work is accessible to a wide audience because it is easy to understand and relate to. However, some critics argue that Hockney is overrated and that his work lacks substance.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world and distant parts of the solar system. It has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Photography has changed radically since its invention in 1839. It has moved into what might be termed 'mythic time' and has passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document.<eos>"

Poetry is like a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and careful. If you make a mistake, it can be a disaster. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination. You can also write to express your feelings or to tell a story. There are different ways to write poetry. You can write to a schedule, or you can wait for inspiration. The most important thing is to find your own style and to write with passion.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or a lot of unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be short and only used if they are necessary. Dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. It can reveal two sides of a question in less time than explaining it from only one person's viewpoint. Overwriting can kill a short story. But brevity does not mean that you have to reduce the story to a synopsis. You need to sustain the conflict and action in a short story as well as in a novel.

Screenplays are like chess. The more you play, the more you learn. If you want to write a screenplay, you need to understand the basics of chess. You also need to be able to see the game as a whole. Once you see the game as a whole, you can start to see patterns emerge in the play.

Writing is a human instinct, but written language is not. It is a complex and difficult skill. However, it is also a rewarding and fulfilling one. If you want to write, you need to practice and learn from your mistakes.<eos>"

I have never started a book with more worry. If I call it a book, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I don't end it with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well. I have little knowledge of what happened to him between the times I saw him. I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in the story. I have also made sure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.<eos>"

Poetry recitals are happening all the time. Sometimes, poets read their poems in public. There are different kinds of poetry and different ways to read it. Some poets write poems that are meant to be read on the page. Other poets write poems that are meant to be read aloud. There are also different ways to promote poetry recitals. Some people hold poetry readings in their homes or community centers. Schools and colleges sometimes invite poets to read their poems to students. Arts festivals sometimes have poetry readings by well-known authors. The benefits of attending poetry recitals are many, but they are not always clear. If you want to learn more about poetry, you should read poems on the page. However, attending poetry recitals can also be a valuable learning experience. It can help you to understand where the precise emphases are to be placed.<eos>"

Oral History

The trend of historians using oral evidence has some challenges. It is not always true that someone's testimony is a pure reflection of the past. In an interview, each person is affected by the other person. The historian chooses the informant and tells them what to talk about. Even if the historian does not ask any questions and simply listens, the presence of an outsider changes the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. The end product of the interview is influenced by both the historian's social position and the terms in which he or she has learned to analyse the past.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to studying animals. One approach is called physiological, which focuses on how the body works. The other approach is called whole animal, which studies the behaviour of the intact animal. Within the whole animal approach, there are two main types of study: psychology and ethology. Psychologists study learning abilities in a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists study naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals in their wild habitats.

Social Sciences

Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You have to learn the substance of the subject and the methodology at the same time. This means becoming familiar with the knowledge and research findings in the textbooks and the methods used to obtain and organise that knowledge. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related.

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. We often praise artists for being unique and revolutionary, but we also criticize them for going too far. Sometimes, we feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. But when we get to the art of our own day, we get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far.

There is a new rule in the art world that says once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam. If an artist tries to strike out in a new direction, they will usually be met with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.

But there are a few artists who break the mould and get away with it. Picasso and Hockney are two prime examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now gamely running contrary to form. His new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground.

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side.<eos>"

It also follows that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews. If you are a writer, you can also be a reviewer. However, reviewing must be a secondary occupation.

There are some activities that take a long time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.<eos>"

Today, there are many more charts and catalogues, and telescopes are more accessible. Computers have made it easier to analyze observations and publish results.

However, there has also been a loss of things. Now you have to travel farther to find a sky that is comparable to the sky in urban areas fifty years ago.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The traveller's main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', so accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Early maps were often rivalled by written itineraries. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were indicated by signs, and the conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map and from place to place. To understand early maps, it is important to understand the particular convention employed. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of maps. It has called in other sciences to its aid, such as terrestrial magnetism and astronomy. The demands being made of the map maker were shifting significantly, and maps must never be accepted uncritically as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique.<eos>"

Students of detective stories have explained the flourishing of this genre as an expression of the conflicts of late nineteenth and early twentieth century society. Detective stories are a type of fiction that tells a story about a crime and its solution. The detective story is an allegory. The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society.

When Keith and Dawne went to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

They were offered beds in the hotel, but they became alarmed when they realized that they were being offered them for the duration of their holiday.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can find insects by tapping the surface of the wood and listening for reverberations. The aye-aye can also hear the rustle of insects. If you listen carefully, you can hear the aye-aye tapping the surface of the wood and making other sounds.

**Questions:**

1. What does the aye-aye use its incisor teeth to do?

We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. She writes a hardback book of at least 20,000 words - with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The book costs nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth, but the passengers felt weightless for a few seconds. They floated aimlessly and danced in the unreal silence. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The students were excited and exhilarated. They felt that they were on a journey to space.<eos>"

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. They were like velvet and had milky-coloured eyes. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. The cubs were fed every four hours and grew quickly. After a few weeks, they were eating cereals and other food. As they grew older, they started to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night.

One evening, I spotted odder badgers in our field. They were climbing into our badger pen and I was warned that they would kill the cubs. To protect the cubs, I placed sheet metal over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.

I designed and built a sett for the badgers. It had three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass side to enable people to see into the sett from a darkened enclosure. The badgers moved into their new home and I am happy to see them.

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans. Halley's journey was the first dedicated scientific expedition on the seas. He became the first civilian who was appointed naval captain to pursue what many regarded as an obsession with declination.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's journey. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews. Dr. Clark is prepared to give up his life for eight months to do this. He believes that Halley's accomplishments deserve to be celebrated.<eos>"

Peacocks that live in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, have a beautiful tail that they show off to the hens. The peacocks' tail is a waste of space and can be a problem for them. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He said that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert.

The peacocks' tail is not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival. The females like the showiest males. The cocks with the most eye-spots on their tail do indeed attract the most mates. But whether the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down.

There is a final twist to this story. If a female first picks a male with a slightly better tail than the rest, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This is how the runaway begins.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities between humans and animals exist. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. Monkeys also have a simple one-word language. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.

There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian. Second, human art is made for aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Let's scrutinise these claims. First, human art does seem different from animal art because it is not utilitarian. Second, human art seems unique because it is made for aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is different because it is a learned rather than an instinctive activity.

These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played off the board as well as on it. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'.

Volunteer tourism is a topic that four academic writers discuss. It can be a positive or negative experience. On the one hand, it can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks. On the other hand, it can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development.

Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development. However, volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. It can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate. Yet it also bypasses the democratic imperative of representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity.<eos>"

They often put their fruit and veg at the front of the store or even display house plants for sale. They also provide an in-store bakery that smells like fresh bread. The layout of the store can also influence what you buy. Products that are placed in the most visible areas are more likely to be bought. Supermarkets often spread low-priced staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores. They also use lighting to make certain foods look more appealing. Some supermarkets have divided up their floors with different carpeting to guide shoppers along certain routes. In-store promotion can also influence what you buy. Giant photographs of food and promotional offers can be very tempting.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main idea of the text?
2. What are some of the selling devices that supermarkets use to make you spend more money?

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is not effective because it is not targeted. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. The only way to make advertising more effective is to target the relevant minority of people. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all.<eos>"

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he thought he was seeing scientific proof that fairies really existed based on photographs he saw. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen for many years. They have made weapons, armour, and farming tools. They have also been feted as artises. In the past, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. Today, blacksmiths are not as widely used, but there has been a recent revival of interest in the craft.

There are many different types of blacksmithing. Some blacksmiths make gates and balconies, while others make sculptures and jewelry. No other base metal can give man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security.

If you are interested in learning more about blacksmithing, there are a few events coming up that you can attend. One event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). This event will be held at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere.

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again.

C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. It was a lonely day. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.

D. Hilary's story I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work.<eos>"

His parents gave him every chance to practise and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career.

Hardenberger has a gift for finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet. He started playing the trumpet at a young age and has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple.

One day, Hardenberger entered a competition and won second prize. He was faced with a concerto that had already daunted him, but he enjoyed the performance. He realised that though he 'played like a pig', people did listen to him.

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but it also means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.

However, the decline in print newspaper sales is not as dramatic as some people might think. There are still a lot of people who read newspapers, both in print and online. And, the advertising rates for print newspapers are much higher than the advertising rates for online newspapers.

This means that newspaper companies still have a lot of their high profile in print. However, it also means that they have to work harder to attract a paying readership.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you have to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to consider the background and environment. If you want to show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building or mountain in the frame. If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be far easier to do. A good picture will show a balance between the subjects and the place they were visiting, so that both claim an equal share of the viewer's attention.<eos>"

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although it is easier to capture newsworthy events with digital cameras and camera phones, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, there is debate about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that a large number of people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians so won't necessarily be near the site of the complaint. People often feel a not unpleasant dull ache or tingling sensation when the needle is gently manipulated.

Acupuncture can be effective for chronic pain, but it won't work for everyone. It usually takes between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief.

It's unlikely that your average medical doctor would take into account the factors that an acupuncturist considers when making a diagnosis.<eos>"

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

The air pressure in the polar regions is lower, which has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

We got lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes and ran out of water. We spent the second day trying to find water.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit. We camped outside the refuge.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

We all got to the top within 8 hours. Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

We crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

We reached the summit by 11 am. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole.

No title. Many trees in the Brackham area were blown down in a terrible storm that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had changed the appearance of the town centre entirely. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force, was not able to notice the change because he was sick. He had been ill with bronchitis and was unable to work. When he finally got well, he realised that the loss of the trees had made a permanent difference to the appearance of his living-room. The Pelhams' large house stood in a sizeable garden. It had not come cheap, but Pelham had no regrets about buying it. With the trees gone, the room seemed cruelly bright, its worn furnishings exposed in all their shabbiness.

1. What happened to the trees in the Brackham area?
2. What was the effect of the storm on the appearance of the town centre?

We lived in a valley for a long time. One day, we realized that the hills around us could be dangerous. The snow started to fall and it covered the land. The snow and wind were inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. The river was the biggest threat to us. It was flowing very fast and it was threatening to flood our home. The snow started to melt and the river became even fuller. One day, the dam broke and the river flooded the land. We prayed that it would stay below its wall and thankfully, it did. Now, we can enjoy the beautiful clouds and the powerful river without fear.

Film Critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. He had done some reviewing before he started writing for The Front Page, such as novels and films. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a lot of ideas for the newspaper, one of which was to have a team of critics take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. Mark feels that his role in the public arena is to put forward an argument, not to be 'right' or to judge films.<eos>"

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because it's fun. A teenager with a taste for endurance wanted: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping.

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. She won the junior section - but then she was the only junior taking part. She was determined to do well and she worked very hard to achieve her goal. But she did not give up and is determined that she never will.

Melanie has tried other events. She has had a go at the triathlon 'sprint', for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon.<eos>"

It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds bought the house and have added to it. They have a lot of flowers in the house. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, Mrs. Malseed sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.

In the morning, we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere.

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and remembering that it wasn't about passing or failing. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and they will produce a report giving their observations and recommendations.

If you are considering changing your career, you should think about the pros and cons of each option. You may need to weigh the cost of retraining against your financial commitments. If you have no idea what you want to do, you can go to a careers adviser and they can help you find the right path.<eos>"

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans. Cacao beans can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. Chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, chocolate powder was invented. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847. Today, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week.<eos>"

Since they started digging, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth, and removing old cars and rubbish.

Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put money into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.

I was dirty, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was tired of foreign timetables, currencies and languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel all over Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not there, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage. It is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The system works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a certain time before departure. They also have minimum connecting times (MCTs) that are designed to allow for baggage transfers. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.<eos>"

To be successful, you need to know the markets you are aiming at and what publishers are looking for. You can find out about this by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go to the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.

Once you have read about the markets and publishers, you need to start writing. Write as much as you can and improve your writing skills. Don't be afraid to get feedback from other writers or teachers. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. But don't give up.

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. If you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

She went to the flat and met a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf. The girl was coming down the stairs and said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent.

Jo was amazed by the girl's appearance and her attitude. She had seen some of those girls on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins also suffer from pollution and other substances found in the sea. One example is pesticides. These poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.

Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.<eos>"

In their natural habitat, Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman, two film-makers, are often away from their home comforts for months on end. They are searching for the perfect shot. The Ngorongoro Crater, where they live, has been experiencing a lot of rain recently. This has caused a number of problems. One problem is that their vehicles get stuck in the mud. To solve this problem, they had to invest in an expensive piece of equipment. Their partnership has created some of TV's finest wildlife films. They have filmed many animals, including leopards and jackals. Film-makers have been travelling the world to film exotic wildlife since the birth of television. Newman and Barrett have a close working relationship. They argue sometimes, but they always get over it quickly. They don't regard themselves as leaders. They see the animals in a similar way. Their daily diet consists of pre-packed meals and tea. It can be a rough existence, but the appeal of being alone in such remote areas is that they can get close enough to the animals to become part of their lives.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our actual words.

Mary Pearce was a teacher who worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job because the Head Teacher thought she didn't fit the image of an office manager.

Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language.

Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. If you inform yourself about the company and speak clearly and concisely, you are more likely to make a good impression.<eos>"

Today, most of the planet's green places have been taken over by farmers. As a result, we eat mostly three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. We have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. From then on, agriculture spread.

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. But to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of the contents.

I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mom when I was young. My mom always insisted that I write my own thank-you letters. When I left home to train as a doctor, I would write once a week. And my mom would write too. Sometimes my dad would write and it was always a joy to receive his letters.

I also have penfriends from all over the world. I have one penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. I also have a penfriend in France. If I hadn't started talking to her in a restaurant, I would never have been able to write to her. And if she hadn't replied, we would have been the poorer for it.

I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mom before me, I insist that they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. And my son has penfriends of his own.

I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 'lost art'.<eos>"

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others want to allow people to look at the site but impose rules to prevent damage.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. There may also have to be a charge for visitors.

The drawings are an important part of history and should be preserved for future generations. If we do not take steps to protect them, they will be lost forever.<eos>"

Week after week, British newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. These pictures often damage individuals in the public eye when they see their private moments captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures in the public interest are rarely in the public interest. Do pictures of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers.<eos>"

In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south. My journey was over.<eos>"

Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb. We planned to camp for three days. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. The track was steep and there was lots of snow. We had to be careful. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. It was a clear day. You can see the sea and the island of Skye. However, the mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much as a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly.

A month ago, I was hanging 30 meters above the ground. I looked down at the river below me and realized why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not very nice, but we had everything we needed. On Saturday morning, I met the other ten members of our group. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we'd done.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. Sharks are dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. Sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. They were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. Each week after that, a new part of the hotel is completed until the hotel is finished. The hotel melts in the spring. Guests can wear warm clothes and socks inside the hotel, but they need to bring their own sweaters and scarves. If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the website. You can also order equipment and book your visit at the same time.

The shop was soon full and the managers decided to close the doors. Some people became angry because they couldn't get into the shop. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop. The road was then completely blocked. One customer, Jenny Smith, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.'

Not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults.

Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes.

San Francisco is a city in northern California, USA. It is located on the coast. In the past, there was a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola who discovered the area in 1769. The bay is a beautiful natural harbour. Although people discovered the bay by land, it is still a popular place for sailors. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco to find gold.

In the past, people wore shoes that were not comfortable or fashionable. They were probably made of animal skin. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a few years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

**Questions:**

1. What were the early shoes made of?
2. What is the main difference between the early shoes and the shoes we wear today?
3. What materials are commonly used to make shoes today?
4. What was the impact of the introduction of sewing machines on the shoe industry?

When I injured my back, I had to take a break from running. I decided to start a running group for women in my area because I was frustrated by the lack of women in the sport and the lack of separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women joined. They were all attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. At first, they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress.<eos>"

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. In the winter, there was no way to get to the towns by boat or plane. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.

**Questions:**

1. What was the original purpose of the Iditarod Trail?
2. What happened in 1925 that led to the use of dog teams to transport medicine?
3. What is the name of the dog sled race that is held every year in Alaska?

Maria Mutola was playing football in a local competition in Mozambique in 1988. She won the competition. At first, no one thought it was a problem that she was a girl. But then the team they beat complained. The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realized that she was fast. He talked to Maria about athletics and bought her running shoes and took her training. It was hard work and Maria's legs really ached. But Jose visited Maria's parents and persuaded them she could be successful. They agreed to let him take her away to train. In 1991, Maria finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family.

The Rocky Mountains run across North America. They start in the northwest and lie a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are still wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, a city that is very popular with tourists. Standing with its feet in the water and its head in the mountains, this city allows its residents to ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city centre. There are a few passenger trains that leave Vancouver on the cross-continent railway. Now there are just three a week, but the ride is still a great adventure. You sleep on board, which is fun, but travel through some of the best scenery at night.

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Sometimes, the rain falls heavily and the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods. But, as many winters have been dry in recent times, when the rain does come, it is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked his parents for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, his parents were not sure because of the noise. But Ben argued that playing drums is better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, his parents gave in. They said, ""All right, but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.""

Ben's hobby has been good for his parents. Whenever the band starts practising, they go out for a long walk. And although their music may sound a little strange, they are friendly and polite young men.

Their main worry is that Ben will spend too much time on his musical activities and not enough time on his school work. But so far, this hasn't happened. Ben was right: playing drums has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.<eos>"

In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education.<eos>"

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When the weather gets colder, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer.

Most house burglaries happen between the afternoon and evening, say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday.

The history of farming. Long ago, people used to go to the forest to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and build bigger villages. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.

**Questions:**

1. What did people do before they started farming?
2. What was the first thing that people did when they started farming?
3. What is the main benefit of farming?
4. What is the main problem with farming?

I would like to return to England but next time I will stay in a different city. I have started English classes again here. I learned a lot of things in England but I know I need to study even harder. How about you? Are you still looking for a job? I hope you find it soon. Love, Sophie

The Weather People are interested in the weather for many reasons. It is important for people in many different jobs. For example, the weather makes a big difference for farmers. Many years ago, farmers spent a long time looking at the sky and at animals and flowers to try and learn more about the weather. Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain.

Sleeping well is very important. When I can get home to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. But I find it very difficult to sleep at night after a concert because my head is full of music. Sport is important. Before I had a car accident, I was at the sports centre two and a half hours a day, five days a week. I can't do that now so I do about 150 sit-ups a day. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat well. Also I drink a lot of water because it's good for your health. I should have about eight glasses a day but I don't always drink so much. People shouldn't work all the time. I love my job but there are other things I like doing too. In my free time, I just listen to music or watch TV. It's good to do nothing sometimes. I don't get tired any more since the doctor told me to eat better. Now I eat lots of things like carrots and spinach every day. But I still eat burgers sometimes.<eos>"

Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a lot higher than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years.<eos>"

I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years, but for the last three years we have lived in the United States. Our children are now learning about life in the United States. I'm sure they will be happier because they have lived in two countries. I like Britain and I want to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is going to start college here soon, so it won't be for another four years. I have just been to England for six weeks to work on a radio programme about the English language and also to talk about the book I've just written. Most writers don't like doing this; they don't like travelling around the country, selling their book. I don't mind it. I like visiting new places and meeting lots of people. It's very different from the life I have in the United States when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was good because I didn't have to pay any bills. Everyone was kind to me and it was fun.

Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his family. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.<eos>"

There were so many thieves that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Later, London became even bigger and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men.

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we went to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

Victoria, a young woman from Britain, started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her recently at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked her why she started the sport. ""I like all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.""

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We asked her what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!""<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are a few ways to climb Kilimanjaro. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Not everyone who tries to climb Kilimanjaro gets to the top. This is often because the weather can change so quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always smiled and laughed, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.<eos>"

Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"
