In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish produced, people would have to buy less of just about everything.
A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference. If that's the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price."

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise your imagination and humour. If you do not have these skills, no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this problem, we need to rethink how work is defined and how it can be reconceived to suit us all. This means that we need to be able to design our own jobs, choose our own colleagues, and have more intimate conversations with our customers.
However, there are challenges to this. One challenge is that many employers are not willing to let their employees have too much autonomy. Another challenge is that traditional conversation skills are not always sufficient for the new kind of conversation that is needed in today's world.
Despite these challenges, I believe that we can all work towards a more fulfilling and meaningful work experience. By learning to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise our imagination and humour, we can all create a more positive and equitable world."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to have a basic need to create a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you're not as good as others. We are constantly being influenced by advertising messages. They are all designed to make you buy, buy, buy.
Caves are a small part of the natural environment that have been studied for many years. They arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge. However, visiting caves requires physical agility, which means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of weather. Countless people originally laid the foundations of meteorology using only their senses. Today, satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us. Computers can solve complex mathematical problems quickly. Meteorological theory is complex, but human experience is still the vital ingredient that translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere."

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Opera, which is primarily a theatre performance, is often seen as the epitome of musical expression. However, after working at a national opera house, the author realized that music takes precedence over theatre in opera. The music comes first, followed by the actors and their performance. In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They mainly understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly impressed by long speeches. Despite these differences, there are similarities between the two art forms. For example, both audiences appreciate the skill of performers and are moved by the passion and emotion conveyed through music and acting. Additionally, both audiences contribute to the overall experience by applauding and expressing their appreciation."

Sand is a natural barrier that can be harmful. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects. When you are wet, sand adheres to you like 'stucco'. However, when you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car, or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, it pours off you. Sand can stay with you for a long time. It is a nuisance, but you can keep it away.
Locks and keys have been used for centuries to provide security. They give people a sense of safety and peace of mind. However, modern electronic locking systems have not been very popular.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting content. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a solitary person. She was as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She had a strong personality and was known for her strict rules and her obsession with cleanliness. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked.
Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city."

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was high. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses down the street that I remembered. They had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses that had once been homes had become stores, and the stores that had once been homes had become stores again. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?
I swam in the pool one day. The warm rain tumbled from the gutter and turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the storm intensified. It was at the height of this drenching in the summer of 1996 that the notion of a long swim through Britain began to form itself. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage."

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social significance. It can help to develop the attachment between mother and child. Tears can also be used to express sympathy, express helplessness, or be shed involuntarily. The sound of crying becomes less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. However, the exact reasons why humans continue to cry into adulthood are still being investigated."

The Earth is getting warmer due to human activity. This is causing changes to the weather and the planet's climate. The changes are already having a significant impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. The effects of climate change are likely to be unfavourable in many areas, but there are also some potential benefits.
One of the most significant impacts of climate change is the rise in sea levels. This is caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the melting of ice. With so many people living in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe. Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results.
Another significant impact of climate change is the increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts. These events can have a devastating impact on ecosystems and human societies."

Aesthetics is a field that studies the theory of art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight.
Another reason is that the perfection of some artworks creates a sense of prestige and isolation. When artworks attain classic status, they become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.
In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.
The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events."

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes, and the economy was in a bad state.
Despite the challenges, advertising professionals still feel pressure to do their jobs well. They are often asked to do more with less and are faced with increasing legal restrictions and the need to produce high-quality advertising.
The recession also had a negative impact on the advertising industry. It made it difficult for agencies to attract clients and made it harder to produce effective advertising. As a result, many advertising professionals feel frustrated and helpless."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
Reading and travel can escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed alongside capitalism. Fashion has a long history, dating back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in national events and individual activities. It provides opportunities for learning and playing instruments, as well as for enjoyment. There is evidence that playing an instrument can have positive effects on cognitive skills, social relationships, and concentration. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the longer term, there are likely to be changes in the way music is listened to and performed. These changes will require a shift in focus for music education. In order to meet these changes, the music profession will need to adapt and evolve."

The craft of acting can be seen as a delicate balance between execution and discussion. Actors often find themselves in situations where they are compelled to talk about their craft and themselves in interviews. Unfortunately, many actors fall into the trap of using ponderous cliches, silly truisms, or the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. To truly appreciate acting, one must pay attention to the execution rather than the discussion.

Blogging: Confessing to the World
Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people realize that there are some downsides to sharing everything on the internet.
The internet has opened up a lot of new opportunities to share our lives with the world. We can write blogs, post photos, and share our stories. But we need to be careful about what we share online. If we put too much information out there, it can have a negative impact on our lives.
One example of this is the story of Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles. She had a blog called Dooce and wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company. This resulted in her losing her job.
Another example is the story of Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student who began posting to the 'WWW' in 1994. He saw an opportunity to share his life and built a hypertext edifice of autobiography. But his story ended tragically when his home page was replaced with a video titled Dark Night.

Humans sleep according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness. Dreams occur during the lightest sleep, and the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids.
There are some things that we know about human sleep with certainty. Women sleep for half an hour longer than men, and older people require less sleep. However, there are also a lot of theories about what sleep is for.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment and to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has also provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society.
Photography is regarded quite naturally as offering such convincing forms of pictorial evidence that this process of communication often seems to render the medium totally transparent, blurring the distinction between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations.
I hope to show that the camera is not merely a mute, passive chronicler of events, and that photography does not just passively reflect culture, but can provide the vision and impetus that promote social and political change and development."

Poetry writing is like walking through a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and avoid making any false steps. If you set yourself up as an expert, you're more likely to make a mistake. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination and creativity. You can also write to a schedule or wait for inspiration to strike. The most important thing is to find your own rhythm and let your creativity flow.
In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or a lot of unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story. Dialogue is more effective than long explanations. You need to keep the story moving and avoid overwriting.

Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals. I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving. I have taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are a popular way to enjoy poetry. There are two main types of poetry recitals: those that are intended to be printed and read on the page, and those that are intended to be performed live. The poets who write for the page tend to write more complex and nuanced poems than the poets who write for performance. However, the poems that are written for performance are often simpler in form and content, and can be more easily assimilated at a single hearing. Attending poetry recitals can be a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken."

Oral History
The use of oral evidence in history has its challenges. It is not always accurate or complete. The historian's role is to select informants and indicate the area of interest. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists study the body's mechanisms and behaviour. Ethologists study the naturally occurring behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap, the two approaches are distinct.
The Social Sciences
Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance and methodology of the subject simultaneously. Each social science discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts.
Classical Architecture
Classical architecture is more than just the construction of buildings. It is an art form that emphasizes aesthetics and proportion. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, the basic principles of form and proportion remain the same throughout history."

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line, shooting the bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
They drove to the English Channel and Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to grant this. They parked in a small street off the sea front and Lily was unclear about the meanings of the roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. The egalitarian approach to book reviews on Amazon allowed anyone to say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars. This free-for-all system lent itself to mischief, but it also provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying.
The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com were serious and well-written. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying.

Another writer wrote a review that compared the book to the architecture of the Internet. These reviews were not taken seriously, but they were entertaining."

Art in modern times, has become more prominent over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we tend to get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.
The artist chooses a piece of text in an art book and writes it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. However, according to the unspoken rule of commercial success, once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam.
I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side."

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.
The house wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries.

Albert Einstein was a famous scientist who developed some mysterious theories about space and time. His theories are famous for being incomprehensible and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience. Einstein made a significant contribution to scientific thinking by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy.
Previously, people had described the universe using Isaac Newton's view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.
The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.
This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury."

We all get along well and help each other out. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.
I met a young author named Elliot a long time ago. He never forgot my face and when I ran across him here or there, he shook hands with me cordially, but showed no desire to further our acquaintance.

One day, I received a note from him asking me to lunch and I conceived the notion that he was trying me out.

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message that stirred the audience, nor was it a great performance, he believed that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience."

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition that has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting.

Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role, but I think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona. I still think the performance is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's games get dangerously out of hand, and the moment when Iago begins to lose control. And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production.

Scientists There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists. The expression 'because it's there' springs to mind. Sure we all know its the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from the atom to the black hole. But what these guys want to know is why we want to know all of this in the first place and why can't science explain why we want to know? Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than get bogged down in debates over the point of it all. I would have thought that the crucial issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognise that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when and why to use it."

The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain and made the writing more careful.
The author also discussed the difference between books and electronic text. He argued that reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most people don't do it. The organization of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text rather than read it in its entirety.

There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were monarchs or nobles.

However, other factors may also explain why breakfast is so important in England today. For example, new patterns of employment may have contributed to the greater importance attached to breakfast.

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed in maps varied with the purpose of the map and from place to place. In order to address the demands of different users, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions'."

Art and the Visual Arts
Television often struggles to showcase the pleasure and complexity of looking at paintings and sculptures. Despite the ability of the camera to capture a whole work of art and zoom in to examine details, few series on television have successfully conveyed both aspects. A good example of this can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
Metals Market
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained something of a reputation as a speculator. Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago.

If you don't get one thrown in with the room, don't worry. Be happy. There are ferries galore. And water-taxis. Or, there are plenty of boats to rent if you prefer to go under your own steam. But sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls.

Self-help books and autobiographies are popular genres of books. They can be very successful, but they also have some negative aspects. For example, self-help books can be very promotional and can create unrealistic expectations. Autobiographies can also be problematic, as they can be inaccurate or misleading.
There are a few reasons why writers should not lapse from the truth when writing autobiographies. First, it is important to maintain the pact between the writer and the reader. Second, it is important to be accurate and truthful in your writing. Third, it is important to be aware of the potential consequences of writing inaccurately.
Science writing is another popular genre of books. To be successful in science writing, it is important to understand the culture of science and to be able to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely. Stephen Jay Gould is one of the greatest science writers of all time. He has written many popular books on science, including The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and The Greatest Show on Earth. Gould's advice for science writers is to never write down to the reader. He also believes that writers should never simplify the argument or adulterate the language."

The Wrong Country Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a very reasonable price. When Keith and Dawne went to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
They were offered beds in the hotel, but they became alarmed when they realized that they were being offered them for the duration of their holiday. They contacted the receptionist and informed him of the mistake. The receptionist did not know about the mistake. But the travel agency was able to help them.

America has only just discovered him. Now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. They are producing biographies and accounts of Shackleton's voyage, mounting a grand exhibition, and preparing a film based on his life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as an icon and exemplar. His qualities as a leader and communicator are being used to teach others.
Shackleton was known for his determination, resourcefulness, and ability to lead others. He was also known for his ability to communicate clearly and effectively.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate named the aye-aye. The aye-aye is similar to a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface in its search for insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like. We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies. The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing.
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story. The final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each."

From here to paternity, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children. I have loved every minute of it. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond.
I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me.
I have never felt out of touch. Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.
I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting. I've noticed more and more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more conscious of the need to involve our children in our lives."

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.

I planted my stake in New Zealand. I had a peculiar period of my life when I didn't have any summers. I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot. I like winter. My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which 'the kids', my brother, sister and I, could look after. We planted the whole 70 acres between the three of us. It rained a lot that year. I enjoy hard physical work. The rhythm is something that everybody tells you about and, of course, it's true of many agricultural jobs that you actually have to train the body into a series of quite standardised moves, and then it becomes immensely easy. The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.
The cubs were fed every four hours and progressed to drinking from a bottle and moving around, albeit shakily. After a few weeks, they were weaned on to creamed rice and other foods. As they grew older, they began to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night.
I have a lot of fun walking with the badgers. We often go through the cider orchard and chase each other's tails. It is a very exciting sport. We also have a sett on the farm where the badgers live. It is a big place with tunnels and chambers. The badgers are very happy in their new home."

Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer and geophysicist who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass, which are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.
Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various locations, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and England. From these travels, he published a chart that proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore,' will involve making precise measurements of declination using advanced instruments. The data collected should help refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.
Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has extensive experience in navigation and has already sailed the distance from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews. And does he share Halley's obsessive trait? Dr. Clark is prepared to dedicate himself fully to the expedition, but he emphasizes that he would not sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason."

Peacocks that live at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks' tail is not necessarily an indicator of fitness. Wallace suggested that the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival. Now, researchers are trying to settle the matter once and for all. They are studying the peacocks' behavior and offspring to see if there is a relationship between the size of the tail and fitness. If there is, then Darwin's theory of sexual selection would be vindicated."

In the past few million years, humans have not developed any significant differences from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps genetically. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities between humans and animals exist. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.
If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.
There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity. However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction."

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in the game of chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. However, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game of chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game of chess is physically and mentally taxing. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire."

Volunteer tourism is a topic that four academic writers discuss. It can have both positive and negative impacts. On the one hand, volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. It can also play a role in developing people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off. On the other hand, volunteer tourism can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. It can also bypass the democratic imperative of representative government and reduce development to individual acts of charity.

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The effectiveness of this defence mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

Picasso was known to be a reclusive artist, so I was doubly astonished to find him in such a public place. I drew a portrait of Picasso and he gave me a generous nod. He also signed my drawing. I was delighted to meet Picasso and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have been able to draw his portrait."

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They often display fresh fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store.
Supermarkets also use lighting to attract shoppers. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.
Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'.
As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you - irresistible if you've had nothing to eat before setting out on your shopping trip."

Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are known for their achievements in climbing and sailing. Bonnington has climbed the summit of Everest and pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps. Knox-Johnston was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handedly. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland. They wrote a book about their trip called Sea, Ice and Rock.
One day, the author was working on a book about adventure and called Knox-Johnston to ask for an interview. They went sailing and climbing together in Greenland. The author found that Knox-Johnston was a natural sailor and that he enjoyed tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory.
The author also found that climbing together was difficult. He had to watch for Robin's safety and make sure that he was safe. The author felt that he was useless at times and that he was concerned about the boat. However, he also knew that Knox-Johnston was worried about the boat and that he was all in favour of having another go at climbing the mountain."

Apples have been with humans since the dawn of recorded time. They have been eaten in many different ways throughout history. In ancient times, apples were used for food, medicine, and religious ceremonies. Today, apples are grown all over the world and are one of the most popular fruits.
Apples are grown commercially from just a few varieties. Most apples are grown for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. This is a problem because it can lead to a lack of variety in apples.
Consumers are starting to demand more variety in apples. We can all help to save diversity in apples by buying a variety of apples from the store. We can also plant apple trees in our own gardens. By working together, we can ensure that apples continue to be enjoyed for many years to come."

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-meter runners, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. The camp is located ten miles south of the equator and is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and train hard, running up to 40 kilometers each day.
The training camp is basic, but the athletes have everything they need to train and live comfortably. They eat simple meals, such as tea, bread, and boiled eggs, and they have access to clean water and streams for bathing.
By the time Nerurkar left the camp, he was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. He couldn't stop himself pondering upon a rather different explanation for the success of Kenyan runners: the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, the gruelling work-outs, and their passion for success."

Advertising is not doing well. It started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is not effective because it is not targeted. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. However, advertising can be cost-effective. If an advertiser can target the right audience, they can be successful."

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. There is a monastic stillness in the house. The Vales designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. They also designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and inexpensive to run.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought they were real. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered."

Throughout the ages, iron has been a powerful force in human imagination. Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen who have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. They have also been recognized as artists. In the eighteenth century, blacksmiths produced beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral and Art Nouveau architecture. However, the practice of blacksmithing had declined in Britain by the late 1960s due to heavy industry and the lack of demand for wrought-iron products. Recently, there has been a revival of blacksmithing thanks to increased interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. The blacksmiths craft is being promoted through various events, including an exhibition of forged ironwork. The exhibition showcases a wide range of pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at PS90 and climb well into four figures. Many artists find the process of working with iron to be magical and rewarding. No other base metal can offer the same visual pleasure or sense of security.

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was furious. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I suppose my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours later was slightly irritating. The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. But I did stop. The physical craving and the pangs of desire for nicotine faded after a few days. I am increasingly coming to the view that smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes."

Hodgkin's most important successes were solving the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12. She pushed the technique into realms of complexity others deemed unreachable at the time.

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense' that allows her to locate water. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. Once she has identified the likely areas, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the stick rises up. If there is no water, the stick does not rise up.
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed.
B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!
C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. But I dithered for ages about how to look. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials. Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.
D. Hilary's story I arrived at the farm early, but I discovered that Rosemary had been up for hours. The process of milking the cows took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day."

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He has a gift for finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo, Sweden. He owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing.
Hardenberger has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. He had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre. He bought all his records, and idolised him. His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career.
Hardenberger has a particular gift of communicating. He learned the pieces for the first round only, but he won through to the second. Luckily he already knew most of the pieces in that round too, but on getting through to the final he was faced with a concerto that had already daunted him. He didn't win first prize that time, but he enjoyed the performance."

New In Paperback A is a novel set in the fictional republic of Efica. The book is notable for its humour, unique vision, and penetrating psychological insight. It also follows the fortunes of one of the most isolated of the Scottish Orkney islands and its inhabitants over a long and uneventful rural history.
The book sets this narrative against pertinent moments in Scottish history. The author is skilled at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events.
The author uses startling images to convey her themes of memory and awareness. Those images are both alienating and illuminating."

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.
The latest print circulation figures show that sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. Books and magazines are also changing. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up massively this year.
However, the decline in print sales is not as dramatic as some might think. Turn to the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 following the main national dailies. And even within Europe, different countries have different stories to tell.
The best way of attracting a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package. And its advertising rates raise between nine and ten times more money than online."

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.
To photograph people well, you need to consider the following:
- Group people at different angles and distances.
- Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
- Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
- Ask your subject to look into the lens.
- Use a background that is relevant to the subject.
- Show the interaction between people.
- Take pictures of people in their natural environment.
- Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting.
- Decide whether you want to pose or not pose your subject."

In the modern workplace, emotional intelligence (EQ) is becoming increasingly important. It is the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. EQ comprises basic elements such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.
More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a valuable component of management philosophy. The less straightforward the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If you have strong emotional intelligence skills, you are more likely to be successful in your job and in your personal life.
There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, EQ is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world."

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

Chewing gum is a popular fashion accessory in the United States, where people chew an average of 12 million sticks a day. Gum is made from a variety of ingredients, including pine resins, softeners, and flavourings. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree. American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees. Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree. Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew. Today, the chewing gum market has grown, and manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands."
