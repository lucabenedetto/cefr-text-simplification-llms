In many developed countries, there is a ritual called municipal refuse collection where rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into a lorry and are carried away to the local tip. This ceremony is peculiar because in most places, it is free. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish produced, people would have to buy less of just about everything.

A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference. If that's the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price.<eos>"

Work can be a fulfilling and meaningful experience, but it is not always the case. Many people feel undervalued and unappreciated in their jobs. To be successful in today's world, you need to be able to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise your imagination and humour. If you do not have these skills, no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.

To counter this problem, we need to rethink how work is defined and how it can be reconceived to suit us all. This means that we need to be able to design our own jobs, choose our own colleagues, and have more intimate conversations with our customers.

However, there are challenges to this. One challenge is that many employers are not willing to let their employees have too much autonomy. Another challenge is that traditional conversation skills are not always sufficient for the new kind of conversation that is needed in today's world.

Despite these challenges, I believe that we can all work towards a more fulfilling and meaningful work experience. By learning to communicate effectively, have a strong mind, and be able to exercise our imagination and humour, we can all create a more positive and equitable world.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally designed to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to have a basic need to create a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you're not as good as others. We are constantly being influenced by advertising messages. They are all designed to make you buy, buy, buy.

Caves are a small part of the natural environment that have been studied for many years. They arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge.

Meteorology is the study of weather. Countless people originally laid the foundations of meteorology using only their senses. Today, satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us. Computers can solve complex mathematical problems quickly. Meteorological theory is complex, but human experience is still the vital ingredient that translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Opera, which is primarily a theatre performance, is often seen as the epitome of musical expression. However, after working at a national opera house, the author realized that music takes precedence over theatre in opera. The music comes first, followed by the actors and their performance. In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They mainly understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly impressed by long speeches. Despite these differences, there are similarities between the two art forms. For example, both audiences appreciate the skill of performers and are moved by the passion and emotion conveyed through music and acting. Additionally, both audiences contribute to the overall experience by applauding and expressing their appreciation.<eos>"

Sand is a natural barrier that can be harmful. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects. When you are wet, sand adheres to you like 'stucco'.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting content. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.

My early life has faded away, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.

My mother was a solitary person. She was as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. She had a strong personality and was known for her strict rules and her obsession with cleanliness. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked.

Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five, you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.<eos>"

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, and the humidity was high. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness. There were many houses down the street that I remembered. They had been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well. The porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes. The wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron. The houses that had once been homes had become stores, and the stores that had once been homes had become stores again. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?

I swam in the pool one day. The warm rain tumbled from the gutter and turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the storm intensified. It was at the height of this drenching in the summer of 1996 that the notion of a long swim through Britain began to form itself. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. He was probably wrong. Scientists have found that crying has a social significance. It can help to develop the attachment between mother and child. Tears can also be used to express sympathy, express helplessness, or be shed involuntarily. The sound of crying becomes less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. However, the exact reasons why humans continue to cry into adulthood are still being investigated.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer due to human activity. This is causing changes to the weather and the planet's climate. The changes are already having a significant impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. The effects of climate change are likely to be unfavourable in many areas, but there are also some potential benefits.

One of the most significant impacts of climate change is the rise in sea levels. This is caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean and the melting of ice. With so many people living in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe. Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results.

Another significant impact of climate change is the increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts. These events can have a devastating impact on ecosystems and human societies.<eos>"

Aesthetics is a field that studies the theory of art. However, the existence of artworks often creates obstacles to understanding aesthetic theory. One reason is that artworks are physical products that exist outside of human experience. They are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. This creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight.

Another reason is that the perfection of some artworks creates a sense of prestige and isolation. When artworks attain classic status, they become isolated from the human conditions under which they were brought into being and from the human consequences they engenders in actual life experience.

In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.

The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts. For instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events.<eos>"

The early years of the 1990s were tough for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes, and the economy was in a bad state.

Despite the challenges, advertising professionals still feel pressure to do their jobs well. They are often asked to do more with less and are faced with increasing legal restrictions and the need to produce high-quality advertising.

The recession also had a negative impact on the advertising industry. It made it difficult for agencies to attract clients and made it harder to produce effective advertising. As a result, many advertising professionals feel frustrated and helpless.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Reading and travel can escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in national events and individual activities. It provides opportunities for learning and playing instruments, as well as for enjoyment. There is evidence that playing an instrument can have positive effects on cognitive skills, social relationships, and concentration. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the longer term, there are likely to be changes in the way music is listened to and performed. These changes will require a shift in focus for music education. In order to meet these changes, the music profession will need to adapt and evolve.<eos>"

The craft of acting can be seen as a delicate balance between execution and discussion. Actors often find themselves in situations where they are compelled to talk about their craft and themselves in interviews. Unfortunately, many actors fall into the trap of using ponderous cliches, silly truisms, or the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. To truly appreciate acting, one must pay attention to the execution rather than the discussion.

Blogging: Confessing to the World

Some time ago, there was a website that talked about the risks of public check-ins. It said that if you post your location online, people you don't know can find out. This made people realize that there are some downsides to sharing everything on the internet.

The internet has opened up a lot of new opportunities to share our lives with the world. We can write blogs, post photos, and share our stories. But we need to be careful about what we share online. If we put too much information out there, it can have a negative impact on our lives.

One example of this is the story of Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles. She had a blog called Dooce and wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company. This resulted in her losing her job.

Another example is the story of Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student who began posting to the 'WWW' in 1994. He saw an opportunity to share his life and built a hypertext edifice of autobiography. But his story ended tragically when his home page was replaced with a video titled Dark Night.

In Europe, there is a sleep research laboratory where they investigate the effects of fatigue on sailors, airpot noise on sleepers, and the dangers of motorway driving for flagging drivers.

Humans sleep according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness. Dreams occur during the lightest sleep, and the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids.

There are some things that we know about human sleep with certainty. Women sleep for half an hour longer than men, and older people require less sleep. However, there are also a lot of theories about what sleep is for. Some people believe that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.<eos>"

It has also provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society.

Photography is regarded quite naturally as offering such convincing forms of pictorial evidence that this process of communication often seems to render the medium totally transparent, blurring the distinction between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations.

I hope to show that the camera is not merely a mute, passive chronicler of events, and that photography does not just passively reflect culture, but can provide the vision and impetus that promote social and political change and development.<eos>"

Poetry writing is like walking through a minefield. You need to be spontaneous and avoid making any false steps. If you set yourself up as an expert, you're more likely to make a mistake. To write poetry, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination and creativity. You can also write to a schedule or wait for inspiration to strike. The most important thing is to find your own rhythm and let your creativity flow.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or a lot of unnecessary details. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if they help the story. Dialogue is more effective than long explanations. You need to keep the story moving and avoid overwriting.

Screenplay writing is like playing chess. The more you practice, the more you become aware of the complexities of the game. You need to be able to see the big picture and the patterns in the play. If you want to write a screenplay, you need to learn the basics of chess.

Writing is a human instinct, but written language is not. It is a complex skill that takes time and practice to learn. Children are naturally wired for sound, but they need to learn how to read and write. We need to understand how the minds of children work and how to help them learn to write.<eos>"

I have never begun a novel with more uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals. I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving. I have taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.

Poetry recitals are a popular way to enjoy poetry. There are two main types of poetry recitals: those that are intended to be printed and read on the page, and those that are intended to be performed live. The poets who write for the page tend to write more complex and nuanced poems than the poets who write for performance. However, the poems that are written for performance are often simpler in form and content, and can be more easily assimilated at a single hearing. Attending poetry recitals can be a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken.<eos>"

Oral History

The use of oral evidence in history has its challenges. It is not always accurate or complete. The historian's role is to select informants and indicate the area of interest. The presence of an outsider can affect the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. Historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists study the body's mechanisms and behaviour. Ethologists study the naturally occurring behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap, the two approaches are distinct.

The Social Sciences

Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance and methodology of the subject simultaneously. Each social science discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts.

Classical Architecture

Classical architecture is more than just the construction of buildings. It is an art form that emphasizes aesthetics and proportion. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, the basic principles of form and proportion remain the same throughout history.<eos>"

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line, shooting the bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.

They drove to the English Channel and Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to grant this. They parked in a small street off the sea front and Lily was unclear about the meanings of the roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

Chen was in a somber mood as he planned Man Kee's career. He put a coin in the slot and trained the glass on the ship. He was unable to find it at first, although he had aimed off carefully.

The internet opened up new possibilities for literary criticism. One of the most significant benefits was the ability for anyone to share their opinions about books on Amazon.com. The egalitarian approach to book reviews on Amazon allowed anyone to say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars. This free-for-all system lent itself to mischief, but it also provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying.

The vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com were serious and well-written. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying. However, there was also some silliness. For example, one writer submitted a review for his own book that was full of glowing praise. Another writer wrote a review that compared the book to the architecture of the Internet. These reviews were not taken seriously, but they were entertaining.<eos>"

Art in modern times, has become more prominent over the last two hundred years. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and shocking. But when we get to the art of our own day, we tend to get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

The artist chooses a piece of text in an art book and writes it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. However, according to the unspoken rule of commercial success, once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam.

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side.<eos>"

Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.

The house wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries.

Albert Einstein was a famous scientist who developed some mysterious theories about space and time. His theories are famous for being incomprehensible and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience. Einstein made a significant contribution to scientific thinking by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy.

Previously, people had described the universe using Isaac Newton's view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

There are some activities that take a long time to complete. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. The third is slower and more purposeful, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.

This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury.<eos>"

I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence which fell when I spoke. I still grin inanely or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients.

Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role, but I think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona. I still think the performance is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's games get dangerously out of hand, and the moment when Iago begins to lose control. And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production.

Scientists There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists. The expression 'because it's there' springs to mind. Sure we all know its the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from the atom to the black hole. But what these guys want to know is why we want to know all of this in the first place and why can't science explain why we want to know? Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than get bogged down in debates over the point of it all. I would have thought that the crucial issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognise that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when and why to use it.<eos>"

Maps are used to show the relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface. They are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of maps. The accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance for ordinary travellers. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs. The conventions employed in maps varied with the purpose of the map and from place to place.

Language is a powerful tool that humans use to communicate and express themselves. It is an instinctive ability that allows us to shape events in each other's brains. Language is deeply intertwined with human experience and is essential for life. When there is no one to talk to, people often talk to themselves or their pets.

Climate and weather, which are created by the air around us, have a significant impact on the lives and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can be a powerful force on the character of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are home to a wide variety of species. Conversely, cold and windy areas can only sustain a limited number of living things.

Coffee is an important part of many people's lives. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success or failure can depend on its coffee reputation. Making a good cup of coffee is not easy, but it is an art and a science that requires time and practice.<eos>"

Art and the Visual Arts

Television often struggles to showcase the pleasure and complexity of looking at paintings and sculptures. Despite the ability of the camera to capture a whole work of art and zoom in to examine details, few series on television have successfully conveyed both aspects. A good example of this can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

Metals Market

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained something of a reputation as a speculator. Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago.

Abaco Islands

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas that stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer, to Cuba. Each island has its own personality, each one has something to offer. The key to getting anywhere in the islands and cays of Abaco is a boat. If you don't get one thrown in with the room, don't worry. Be happy. There are ferries galore. And water-taxis. Or, there are plenty of boats to rent if you prefer to go under your own steam. But sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that gems can be found. At night it's the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay that sparkle.<eos>"

Self-help books and autobiographies are popular genres of books. They can be very successful, but they also have some negative aspects. For example, self-help books can be very promotional and can create unrealistic expectations. Autobiographies can also be problematic, as they can be inaccurate or misleading.

There are a few reasons why writers should not lapse from the truth when writing autobiographies. First, it is important to maintain the pact between the writer and the reader. Second, it is important to be accurate and truthful in your writing. Third, it is important to be aware of the potential consequences of writing inaccurately.

Science writing is another popular genre of books. To be successful in science writing, it is important to understand the culture of science and to be able to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely. Stephen Jay Gould is one of the greatest science writers of all time. He has written many popular books on science, including The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and The Greatest Show on Earth. Gould's advice for science writers is to never write down to the reader. He also believes that writers should never simplify the argument or adulterate the language.<eos>"

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate named the aye-aye. The aye-aye is similar to a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface in its search for insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Scientists have discovered that the aye-aye can locate the insects hidden inside the wood by tapping the surface of the wood with its middle finger and listening for reverberations. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.

From here to paternity, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children. I have loved every minute of it. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond.

I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me.

I have never felt out of touch. Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.

Six years ago, I turned my dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I found three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.

The cubs were fed every four hours and progressed to drinking from a bottle and moving around, albeit shakily. After a few weeks, they were weaned on to creamed rice and other foods. As they grew older, they began to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night.

I have a lot of fun walking with the badgers. We often go through the cider orchard and chase each other's tails. It is a very exciting sport. We also have a sett on the farm where the badgers live. It is a big place with tunnels and chambers. The badgers are very happy in their new home.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a renowned astronomer and geophysicist who made significant contributions to the field of navigation. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was charting the variations of the compass, which are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley's journey to chart declination took him to various locations, including Cape Verde Islands, Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and England. From these travels, he published a chart that proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore,' will involve making precise measurements of declination using advanced instruments. The data collected should help refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.

Does Dr. Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success? He has extensive experience in navigation and has already sailed the distance from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews. And does he share Halley's obsessive trait? Dr. Clark is prepared to dedicate himself fully to the expedition, but he emphasizes that he would not sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason.<eos>"

Peacocks that live at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their magnificent trains to the hens. The peacocks' trains are very impressive, but they are not necessarily advantageous. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. However, the peacocks' tail is not necessarily an indicator of fitness. Wallace suggested that the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival. Now, researchers are trying to settle the matter once and for all. They are studying the peacocks' behavior and offspring to see if there is a relationship between the size of the tail and fitness. If there is, then Darwin's theory of sexual selection would be vindicated.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans have not developed any significant differences from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps genetically. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities between humans and animals exist. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.

There are three supposed distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Second, human art is not motivated by aesthetic pleasure. Third, human art is a learned rather than an instinctive activity. However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. However, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game of chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game of chess is physically and mentally taxing. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire.<eos>"

Volunteer tourism is a topic that four academic writers discuss. It can have both positive and negative impacts. On the one hand, volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. It can also play a role in developing people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off. On the other hand, volunteer tourism can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. It can also bypass the democratic imperative of representative government and reduce development to individual acts of charity.

**Questions:**

1. What are some of the potential benefits of volunteering?
2. What are some of the potential drawbacks of volunteer tourism?
3. How can volunteer tourism be used to promote sustainable development?
4. What are some of the challenges associated with volunteer tourism?
5. What is the overall message of the text about volunteer tourism?<eos>"

Many people listen to the radio when they wake up in the morning. To wake up, most people need some external means. One common way to wake up is the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself, Tom Granger, and Paul Bridges, tested five currently available clock radios.

We all thought the quality of the radios was excellent, but we found that the biggest one was too big for our bedside tables. The biggest radio was as big as a rugby ball. We also found that the radios were difficult to set up. However, we all agreed that the radios worked well once they were set up.

The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this one scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'. However, he also accepted that manufacturers had been obliged to improve the quality of radios because of the advent of button-tuning.<eos>"

A hedgehog is a small mammal that has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many different parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. Hedgehogs have the ability to roll into a tight ball when they are attacked. The effectiveness of this defence mechanism depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

To excel in any sport is challenging, even for men. Women have to be even tougher. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. Despite the odds, women are breaking records and overcoming prejudice.

Here, we talk to just a few brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, a skier, says, ""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. You just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice.""

B. Caroline, a cyclist, says, ""I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I'm at because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money.""

C. Annabel, a rower, says, ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level.""

D. Ffyona, a long-distance walker, says, ""I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record!""

E. Lisa, a saloon car racer, says, ""Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!""

F. Alison, a triathlete, says, ""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes!""<eos>"

The day I met Picasso, I was an 18-year-old student travelling around Europe and Morocco. I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront and spent much of my time drawing. One day, I met Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes harbour. He was seated with his wife and three companions. I was surprised to see him and managed to get his signature. Picasso was known to be a reclusive artist, so I was doubly astonished to find him in such a public place. I drew a portrait of Picasso and he gave me a generous nod. He also signed my drawing. I was delighted to meet Picasso and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have been able to draw his portrait.<eos>"

Talking shop Ever entered a store and bought more than you intended to buy? Supermarkets know that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They often display fresh fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store.

Supermarkets also use lighting to attract shoppers. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.

Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'.

As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you - irresistible if you've had nothing to eat before setting out on your shopping trip.<eos>"

Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington and Robin Knox-Johnston are known for their achievements in climbing and sailing. Bonnington has climbed the summit of Everest and pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps. Knox-Johnston was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handedly. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland. They wrote a book about their trip called Sea, Ice and Rock.

One day, the author was working on a book about adventure and called Knox-Johnston to ask for an interview. They went sailing and climbing together in Greenland. The author found that Knox-Johnston was a natural sailor and that he enjoyed tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory.

The author also found that climbing together was difficult. He had to watch for Robin's safety and make sure that he was safe. The author felt that he was useless at times and that he was concerned about the boat. However, he also knew that Knox-Johnston was worried about the boat and that he was all in favour of having another go at climbing the mountain.<eos>"

Apples have been with humans since the dawn of recorded time. They have been eaten in many different ways throughout history. In ancient times, apples were used for food, medicine, and religious ceremonies. Today, apples are grown all over the world and are one of the most popular fruits.

Apples are grown commercially from just a few varieties. Most apples are grown for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. This is a problem because it can lead to a lack of variety in apples.

Consumers are starting to demand more variety in apples. We can all help to save diversity in apples by buying a variety of apples from the store. We can also plant apple trees in our own gardens. By working together, we can ensure that apples continue to be enjoyed for many years to come.<eos>"

The long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-meter runners, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. The camp is located ten miles south of the equator and is surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and train hard, running up to 40 kilometers each day.

The training camp is basic, but the athletes have everything they need to train and live comfortably. They eat simple meals, such as tea, bread, and boiled eggs, and they have access to clean water and streams for bathing.

By the time Nerurkar left the camp, he was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. He couldn't stop himself pondering upon a rather different explanation for the success of Kenyan runners: the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, the gruelling work-outs, and their passion for success.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is not effective because it is not targeted. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. However, advertising can be cost-effective. If an advertiser can target the right audience, they can be successful.<eos>"

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. There is a monastic stillness in the house. The Vales designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. They also designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and inexpensive to run.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought they were real. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Throughout the ages, iron has been a powerful force in human imagination. Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen who have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. They have also been recognized as artists. In the eighteenth century, blacksmiths produced beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral and Art Nouveau architecture. However, the practice of blacksmithing had declined in Britain by the late 1960s due to heavy industry and the lack of demand for wrought-iron products. Recently, there has been a revival of blacksmithing thanks to increased interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. The blacksmiths craft is being promoted through various events, including an exhibition of forged ironwork. The exhibition showcases a wide range of pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at PS90 and climb well into four figures. Many artists find the process of working with iron to be magical and rewarding. No other base metal can offer the same visual pleasure or sense of security.

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was furious. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I suppose my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours later was slightly irritating. The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. But I did stop. The physical craving and the pangs of desire for nicotine faded after a few days. I am increasingly coming to the view that smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes.<eos>"

Hodgkin's most important successes were solving the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12. She pushed the technique into realms of complexity others deemed unreachable at the time.

Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense' that allows her to locate water. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business.

Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 meters down. She uses a map of the area and a pendulum to find likely areas. Once she has identified the likely areas, she walks over the fields with a hazel stick. If there is water below, the stick rises up. If there is no water, the stick does not rise up.

Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

A. Amanda's story I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was at the restaurant. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed.

B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could. I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!

C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up early and sleep late. But I dithered for ages about how to look. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials. Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.

D. Hilary's story I arrived at the farm early, but I discovered that Rosemary had been up for hours. The process of milking the cows took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day.<eos>"

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is strange that many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a musician who has established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. He has a gift for finding the right compromise and making a relationship with the imperfections of the trumpet.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo, Sweden. He owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing.

Hardenberger has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple. He had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre. He bought all his records, and idolised him. His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career.

Hardenberger has a particular gift of communicating. He learned the pieces for the first round only, but he won through to the second. Luckily he already knew most of the pieces in that round too, but on getting through to the final he was faced with a concerto that had already daunted him. He didn't win first prize that time, but he enjoyed the performance.<eos>"

The book sets this narrative against pertinent moments in Scottish history. The author is skilled at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events.

The author uses startling images to convey her themes of memory and awareness. Those images are both alienating and illuminating.<eos>"

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others, but transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future.

The latest print circulation figures show that sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. Books and magazines are also changing. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up massively this year.

However, the decline in print sales is not as dramatic as some might think. Turn to the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 following the main national dailies. And even within Europe, different countries have different stories to tell.

The best way of attracting a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package. And its advertising rates raise between nine and ten times more money than online.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. To take a good picture of people, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

To photograph people well, you need to consider the following:

- Group people at different angles and distances.
- Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
- Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
- Ask your subject to look into the lens.
- Use a background that is relevant to the subject.
- Show the interaction between people.
- Take pictures of people in their natural environment.
- Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting.
- Decide whether you want to pose or not pose your subject.<eos>"

Sarah Janson is an artist who creates illusions of reality through her paintings. She is not interested in being recognized as a creator or genius artist. Instead, she focuses on the importance of the artwork itself. Janson has been painting trompe-l'oeil for sixteen years and has a string of major corporate and private commissions behind her. Much of her work is inspired by architecture or made for architectural settings.

Janson's paintings are unique and can be seen in a league of their own. They are often inspired by architecture and give the illusion that you can step into another room. However, there is also a danger with trompe-l'oeil that once you get the joke, your attention is lost.

Janson is generous in praise of her clients and is always willing to listen to their ideas. She is also very grateful for the clients who have let her loose on their walls.<eos>"

In the modern workplace, emotional intelligence (EQ) is becoming increasingly important. It is the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. EQ comprises basic elements such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.

More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a valuable component of management philosophy. The less straightforward the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If you have strong emotional intelligence skills, you are more likely to be successful in your job and in your personal life.

There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, EQ is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world.<eos>"

Should the media earn money from content they don't own? Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, social media has revolutionised citizen photography. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. However, if the media is to prevent its relationship with the public from souring, steps must be taken to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.

**Changes:**

- Removed unnecessary technical jargon (e.g. ""exceptional circumstances"")
- Simplified sentence structure
- Removed unnecessary details (e.g. camera phones)
- Clarified ambiguous phrases (e.g. ""strong public interest"")
- Reduced the overall length of the text
- Maintained the core ideas and factual content of the original text<eos>"

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received most attention in the West.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy flow through the body. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine. It is also used to treat post-operative pain, menstrual pain, facial nerve pain and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

Acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for pain, but it is important to note that it is not a cure. It is important to consult with a medical doctor before making any decisions about acupuncture.<eos>"

P. D. James, a best-selling crime writer, is known for her intricate and brilliant imagination. She exudes an air of quiet authority, but it is soon apparent that she is actually shy. She has written 12 major detective novels that are read avidly by millions worldwide. She is a great fan of the works of close friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys reading detective stories.

James was born in Oxford and grew up mainly in Cambridge. She worked full-time in administration for the National Health Service and made good use of her organizational skills. She became 'quite accustomed' to seeing corpses while working in forensic science. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. It was the shape and construction involved in the writing of a crime novel that appealed to her.

James believes that writing detective stories is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life, even if that life is unlovable. Nobody really likes violence.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.

Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as deviousness, intelligence, and confidence. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other serious problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them.<eos>"

Chewing gum is a popular fashion accessory in the United States, where people chew an average of 12 million sticks a day. Gum is made from a variety of ingredients, including pine resins, softeners, and flavourings. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree. American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees. Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree. Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew. Today, the chewing gum market has grown, and manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.<eos>"

The hotel inspector Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. One day, she was inspecting the Globe Hotel. Things were not going well from the beginning. The receptionist was reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest, but she was not aware of the identity of the real guest. Sue was not impressed by the hotel's poor service and condition. She found out that the hotel was rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide. However, there were some problems with the hotel. The access from the car park was via an unmanned door, and the corridor to the hotel entrance was long and deserted. The receptionist announced that there was no record of the booking, and one of the rooms was unoccupied. Sue found that the room was stuffy and had a gaping panel in the wardrobe. She also found a large hole in the wall. Despite all of the problems, Sue was able to negotiate with the general manager to get some things fixed. She was also able to get the hotel to provide a better service.<eos>"

Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent, the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I climbed the Seven Summits in the order I completed them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

I was in a snow cave below the summit when I started talking to my feet. The cold was getting into my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. We followed a new route and spent the third night on a windswept ridge.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

We got lost in the dense jungles and ran out of water. We found a rock pool and attempted to climb the breach wall, but prudently retired.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

We crossed open slopes and reached the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

We climbed in rock shoes and reached the summit. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

He was sick with bronchitis and couldn't concentrate. His wife, Molly, tried to persuade him to go to the doctor, but he refused. The antibiotics took effect and he started to feel better.

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. And then it happened - the reservoir overflowed. The river seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.<eos>"

Film Critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. He started his first proper job writing articles about films for The Front Page. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. Mark feels that his role in the public arena is to put forward an argument. He's not a judge, and nor would he want to be.<eos>"

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because it's fun. Teenager with a taste for endurance WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). Ability to do all three without a rest essential. The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping. Great for those watching, maybe, but what makes the triathletes want to punish their bodies so much? And what makes an attractive 17-year-old, with excellent academic results, give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers?

Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes automatically use when asked similar questions. 'You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 1Okm, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,' she says.

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. 'I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went round.' Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. 'I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realised then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the running.' But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. 'Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again.' Such doggedness draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. 'I've just been testing her fitness,' he says, 'and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realise they can't go any further, she just kept on.'

Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with PS1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.'<eos>"

The Collectors

Amanda Roy writes about her passion for collecting and the reasons why people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. If you enter this world, remember one thing: you must fall in love with an object before you collect it. People have been collecting objects since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. Others collect flowers, pottery or paintings. There are many reasons why people collect objects. For some, it is the only aspect of their lives where they have complete control. For others, it's just something they enjoy doing. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a 'room of wonders'. Another aristocrat, Catherine the Great of Russia, collected more than 4,000 paintings. You do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. You can collect items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. As small objects become a popular collector's item, so they begin to rise in price.<eos>"

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests and your own input, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and other cognitive tasks. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and they will produce a report giving their observations and recommendations.

Rethinking your career needn't involve a massive change of direction. Last March, after working as a marketing manager with a large insurance company for five years, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job. She decided to go to Career Analysts for help. She was given a number of suggestions, including taking a year off and working in the Far East.

I thought a careers adviser might suggest something I had never thought of.

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The cacao tree is evergreen and produces a fruit that contains seeds. These seeds are dried and become cacao beans, which can be used to make chocolate.

Chocolate is often eaten at Easter and Christmas. People also eat chocolate when they have a special occasion. In the past, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate that had to be melted down in hot water. But now, chocolate is made from chocolate powder or bars.

Chocolate is a popular treat in Britain. People in Britain eat an average of four chocolate bars each week. To attract customers, manufacturers are using new marketing tricks, such as the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert.<eos>"

Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, have travelled from Canada to Africa to find gold. They believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they are convinced that they are close to a large vein of gold.

The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.

Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000 into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.

The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens.<eos>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

The dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to gather samples, and then three hours to get back up to the surface. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released.

Last year, Rachel dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes.

It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder.<eos>"

I was tired, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't take any more punishment. I was exhausted and I couldn't deal with any more foreign timetables, currencies or languages. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train trip was a valuable personal experience. It was my first holiday without parents, and I had a lot of fun. I took great pride in the fact that I could see the view from the station in many places. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.

**Questions:**

1. What was the main purpose of the author's trip?
2. What was the most significant benefit of the Inter-Rail ticket for the author?
3. What did the author dislike about the holiday photos of other people?
4. What does the author believe is the most valuable aspect of the train trip?

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you may have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The system works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a specific time before departure. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are designed to allow for baggage transfers. Sometimes, extra security checks and problems with air traffic can cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. If your luggage goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.<eos>"

The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It feeds on fish. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream. He missed lessons, becoming what he describes as an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only member of its cosmopolitan family to breed in Europe, was getting noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

The Netball Captain

Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is captain of England's netball team. She had a typical day for the weeks leading up to the World Championships. She taught at a local school and had a training session in the local supermarket car park.

Kendra is very focused when she is playing. She doesn't see anything else except her movements and her feet. She might notice cars slowing down out of the corner of her eye, but that's all.

The World Championships are big and important for Kendra. She wants to make sure she is at her absolute best for them. She is on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness.

The first game is against Barbados. Kendra says they will be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.

The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. There's no rest between games and you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.<eos>"

A child who shows outstanding musical ability may need a special understanding and education. There are five music schools in Britain that provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. These schools offer a wide range of musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also provide a restricted academic programme, which concentrates on the essential subjects.

The disadvantages of attending a specialist music school include the cost and the pressure to succeed. However, all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils and offer help and advice if needed. Those who are equally gifted academically may do very well within a less specialised environment.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies are out. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined.

Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and tries to get back there as often as she can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The journey is always enchanting, regardless of the weather or time of the year. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous.

Raj Patel, an explorer, has enjoyed many rail journeys through the years. He has a favorite journey that he would pick: the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in his youth was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park.

Betty Cooper, a novelist, is indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took her and her husband on their honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. It was on the train that her husband gave her a pink dress, which she has worn ever since.

Martin Brown, a journalist, was working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way to continue their journey was to take the Desert Express.

Arisu Mezuki, an actress, imagines most people's favorite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not her case. She was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where she saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until she was a teenager that trains began to dominate her life.<eos>"

I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot of people waiting. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples with matching luggage and swarms of college kids littering the floor. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He was well-off, with tanned skin and a soft, beige car-coat. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was travelling to Philadelphia. He also asked a girl standing near me if she was travelling to New York. I understood why he didn't ask me to go with him. He seemed unreliable. He glanced quickly at me and then swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. He was looking seriously stressed. He was talking about his daughter who was flying out for a study year abroad. He said he put her on a train and came home to find his wife in a state. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been the logical choice, but one of those padded envelopes the size of a paperback book.

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold in the gold rush. If you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true.

She went to the flat and met a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf. The girl was coming down the stairs and said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent.

We wouldn't have her in here, would we, Pauline? Pauline had a psychedelic shirt on, so colourful it almost hurt the eyes. She was a punk, Jo noted with amazement.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. Dolphins are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them.

Another threat to dolphins is pollution. Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies.

Finally, dolphins are also threatened by human disturbance. Noise pollution from ships, oil wells and other sources can disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.

These are just some of the threats that dolphins are facing. It is important to take action to protect these amazing creatures.<eos>"

Getting fit is essential for your mind, body and spirit. It's a great way to maintain a perfect balance when everything seems more and more unbalanced. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It helps prevent muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It also improves the condition of your heart and lungs and blood circulation. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. Stretching is a great way to improve flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe our appearance, including our clothing, eye contact, body language, and voice. Mary Pearce, a teacher, says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.

However, Mary didn't get the job. The Head Teacher's comment was, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?"" This highlights the importance of having a professional image.

Movement and gestures also play a significant role in making a good first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages, the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message.

Finally, it is important to be well-prepared and communicate clearly and concisely. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that you inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences.<eos>"

Young shoppers often go to the supermarket with their parents. Sometimes, parents feel frustrated and guilty when they have to say no to their children's demands. They also worry about the amount of money that is being spent on advertising to children.

Research has shown that children make a purchase request every two minutes when they are in the supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. This advertising can be very persuasive and it can be difficult for parents to resist their children's demands.

Some parents have difficulty deciding which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. They also admit that they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict, such as removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas.<eos>"

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. Today, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. More and more truly big people are born every year. This does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors lived on a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. As a result, most of the planet's green places have been taken over by farmers. The poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people. However, the fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.<eos>"

Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.<eos>"

I like landscapes that have a human element. When I travel abroad, I am attracted to lovely villages with old temples. I also like exploring bleak hilltops, sheltered valleys and old villages.

When I was eight, I went to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham. Cycling was a release from school. I loved exploring the landscape.

My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either.

I also like purchasing Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It is a magic, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except sea, wind and birds.<eos>"

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. When I left home to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a week. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. Letter writing seemed to improve relationships. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. I also have penfriends in Australia and France. I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters.

**Questions:**

1. What is the main point of the text?
2. How does letter writing improve relationships?
3. What are some of the benefits of receiving a letter?
4. What is the author's biggest letter-writing success?

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but to charge a fee or rope off the area and provide guides.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to employ the necessary number of guards to prevent visitors from damaging the drawings. If the government does not provide funding, the drawings will be lost for future generations.<eos>"

Young shoppers often go to the supermarket with their parents. Sometimes, parents feel frustrated and guilty when they have to say no to their children's demands. They also worry about the amount of money that is being spent on advertising to children.

Research has shown that children make a purchase request every two minutes when they are in the supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. This advertising can be very persuasive and it can be difficult for parents to resist their children's demands.

Some parents have difficulty deciding which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. They also admit that they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict, such as removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas.<eos>"

Going up the wall was once a challenging climb that could only be done in the mountains. Now, a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath as high above them on the climbing wall, hangs the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. As the sport developed, it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for the task, using bricks with special edges to cling on to.<eos>"

If you want to become an actor, it's a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs. Once you choose to become an actor, people may tell you that you're crazy. But it's a personal choice and only you can take responsibility for yourself. There are no easy ways to become an actor. It's all a matter of luck and talent. Yet there is a demand for new faces and new talent. Acting is a rewarding career that can offer excitement, glamour and financial rewards.

If you ask actors how they have done well in the profession, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job. Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. Last month you may have been out of work, but suddenly you are asked to audition for a part. However much you want the job, the truth is that it may be denied you. So actors tend not to talk about their chances. They come up with ways of protecting themselves against the stress of competing for a part and the possibility of rejection.<eos>"

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. Today, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. More and more truly big people are born every year. This does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors lived on a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. As a result, most of the planet's green places have been taken over by farmers. The poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. From then on, agriculture spread because it could support more people. However, the fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.<eos>"

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are playing a game called pichenotte. It is a game that was brought to the USA by their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, from Canada. The game is popular in their family and they often play it on weekends and holidays.

Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are flicked across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses have made a business out of their love for the game. They sell boards and make money from championships. They have even created a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'.

As yet, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to produce pichenotte celebrities. Nonetheless, the day is not far off when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury Mercedes rather than a saw and piles of wood.<eos>"

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that intrude into people's privacy. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to individuals in the public eye when their private moments are captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. Rarely, if ever, are these pictures in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. However, there are also some concerns about taking on this role. How would the PCC decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? And if the person involved still refuses to do anything, should the PCC proceed nevertheless?<eos>"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious career planning. Most important, it should extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.

If you are thinking of travelling, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system, and are not likely to go off again.<eos>"

A Jenny, a young woman, was shy and thought she would always stay that way. However, she surprised herself by doing well at school and was encouraged to do a university course.

B Michaela had to take over the family business when her father became ill. She was scared and became aggressive and impatient. But she learned that to be confident, you have to believe in yourself and be patient.

C Lisa, a TV presenter, has to appear confident on camera. She has developed the ability to look confident even when she's terrified.

D Barbara, a restaurant worker, has a natural confidence that comes from enjoying her work. She believes that if you just get on with it and learn from your mistakes, you're more confident the next time round.

E Kim, a former secretary, worked up the confidence to speak up in meetings and public speaking. She found that the real secret of confidence lies in telling yourself over and over again, 'Nothing is impossible.'<eos>"

He drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. He explored the southern half of the state and pointed his car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur. He took a wrong turn and ended up at a river.

What kind of shopper are you? We all go shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers. Some people are addicted to shopping, while others are reluctant or even hate it.

There are different reasons why people shop differently. Some people, like Melanie and her boyfriend, enjoy shopping and spend a lot of money. Others, like Brenda, don't enjoy shopping and tend to feel guilty when they spend money. Still others, like Juliet, only shop for essentials. And there are those who, like Lisa, enjoy shopping but don't buy very much.

So, what kind of shopper are you? Take a look at the different types of shoppers and see which one you most identify with.<eos>"

I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food.

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency.<eos>"

She soon became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We have no copies of her books, but we know that she wrote several important mathematical works.

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the north to the south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The climate can be bitterly cold because of its northerly location. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred meters up - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. They carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for their boots. The track soon climbed and their legs felt heavy. After seven hours of climbing, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. I was glad we had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

Anna's new school is a very exciting place. It's made of wood, just like her old school, but it's also one of the first schools in her country designed to be environmentally friendly. The school took months to build, so they saw it all happening. There are five classrooms, a nursery, a dining room, and changing rooms. The school is well designed to hold all the heat and sound inside, so if they sing inside their classrooms, they can almost believe they're inside a concert hall. There's also a tree on the roof of the school. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. The school is still under construction, but it's already a very impressive place. Anna is so pleased with her new school, and her teachers say they'll all learn much faster now they're in it.<eos>"

A month ago, I was hanging 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. I looked down at the river below me and realized why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not great, but we had everything we needed. On Saturday morning, I met the other ten members of our group. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we'd done.

I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely. The manager of CityBus called me soon after. He said that they had my handbag and offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have excellent eyesight and can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These abilities make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Although sharks are similar to other fish in many ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, sharks need to swim constantly in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This technique is very useful for researchers who often need to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. I was nervous at my first ballet class because I didn't know anyone. Everyone was talking in Russian, but I managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me and my Russian has improved enormously. The classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. I feel confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, the guests were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world-famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. Each week after that, a new part of the hotel is completed until the hotel is finished. The finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Guests can wear warm clothes and socks inside the hotel, but they need to bring their own sweaters and scarves. If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.<eos>"

The shop was soon full and the managers decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry and refused to queue quietly. There was also a problem with the traffic. Many people decided to park their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop. This meant that the road was completely blocked. One customer, Jenny Smith, said that she queued for a long time but didn't have time to buy what she wanted. She said that the staff were calm and explained what was happening.

Tanya Streeter is a world-record-holding free-diver. Free-diving is a sport where people reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath. She had been deeper a year before, but this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man.

Tanya's training regimen is intense. She spends two thirds of her time doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart, but she doesn't run because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness.

When Tanya is not training, she makes frequent public appearances, mainly to advertise sports products. She has also supported environmental organisations. As for the future, Tanya says she plans to keep breaking her own world records.<eos>"

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people thought that cartoons were only for children. But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

San Francisco is a city in northern California, USA. It is located on the coast. The first Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Although San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. In 1849, many people arrived in San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the miners who got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge.

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin and were worn during cold weather. Today, people still use leather, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a few hundred years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made in large factories using machines. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

When I injured my back, I had to take a break from running. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run. I started a running group for women in my area because I was annoyed by the lack of women in the sport and the lack of separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women, young and old, fit and unfit, joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves.<eos>"

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the winter months, there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built. It was used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport. Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

But Jose visited Maria's parents and persuaded them she could be successful. They agreed to let him take her away to train. In 1991, Maria finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family.

The Grand Canyon in the United States was created by the River Colorado. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to go walking and running, but mainly to look at the view. It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 meters. It is a platform whose walls and floor are made of glass so that you can see the beautiful rocks of the canyon. Up to 120 people are allowed to stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007 and since then thousands of people have used it. You have to wear special covers over your shoes to avoid scratching the glass beneath your feet. Walking onto the Skywalk makes you feel like a bird floating high up in the air.<eos>"

The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America. They start in the North-west and lie a few hundred miles from the centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are no less wonderful. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, a beautiful city in Canada. Standing with its feet in the water and its head in the mountains, this city allows its residents to ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city centre. There are a few passenger trains a day that used to set off from Vancouver on the cross- continent railway. Now there are just three a week, but the ride is still a great adventure. You sleep on board, which is fun, but travel through some of the best scenery at night.

**Changes:**

- Removed unnecessary technical details about the geography of the Rockies.
- Simplified the sentence structure and vocabulary.
- Removed the phrase ""which is fun"" to avoid confusion.
- Reduced the number of passenger trains to three a week.
- Changed ""cross- continent railway"" to ""cross- continent railway"" for clarity.<eos>"

People began to keep animals in zoos many years ago. In the early zoos, animals were often taught to perform for the visitors. Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everybody approves of zoos. People who think that zoos are a good idea say that they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals. Some people disapprove of zoos because they believe it is wrong to put animals in cages.

**Questions:**

1. What was the original purpose of zoos in the early days?
2. What is the main purpose of zoos today?
3. What are some of the arguments against zoos?
4. What would not be possible without zoos?
5. What are some of the problems associated with poorly managed zoos?

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! Each band had its own costumes, ranging from black school uniforms to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch - but even better when my band played on stage. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country - I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you.<eos>"

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Although it doesn't happen often, when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods. As many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is divided into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.<eos>"

Their weekly lessons in small classes are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art and became interested in early Italian artists. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. We were hesitant at first because of the noise. But Ben argued that it was better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, we gave in. We said, 'All right,' but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.

Because drums are not easy to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their instruments. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their singing.

Although their music may sound a little strange, the band is friendly and polite. They play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities. But so far, this hasn't happened.<eos>"

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It gives young people the opportunity to study for their exams and gain experience of life outside the classroom. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend their morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of those can attend because they receive government help. ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like. During the summer holidays my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister."" To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.<eos>"

Being an older student, I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary, I was earning a reasonable amount of money, but I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in the job. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who looked happy, carefree and full of hope. However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. They are always mistaking me for a lecturer and asking me questions I can't answer. I also feel separated from the lecturers because, although we are the same age, I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job, which is really important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. Then there are the normal student benefits of long holidays and theatre and cinema discounts. I often have doubts about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this late date has been a wise choice.<eos>"

In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!' When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.

Most house burglaries happen between the afternoon and evening, say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also ask your neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when you are away. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

The history of farming. Before people started farming, they had to go to the forest to find food. They moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain.

I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat well. Also I drink a lot of water because it's good for your health. I should have about eight glasses a day but I don't always drink so much. People shouldn't work all the time. I love my job but there are other things I like doing too. In my free time, I just listen to music or watch TV. It's good to do nothing sometimes. I don't get tired any more since the doctor told me to eat better. Now I eat lots of things like carrots and spinach every day. But I still eat burgers sometimes.<eos>"

Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films every year. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years.<eos>"

I was born in the United States, but I have written several travel books about England. I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years, but for the last three years we have lived in the United States. Our children are now learning about life in the United States. I'm sure they will be happier because they have lived in two countries. I like Britain and I want to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is going to start college here soon, so it won't be for another four years. I have just been to England for six weeks to work on a radio programme about the English language and also to talk about the book I've just written. Most writers don't like doing this; they don't like travelling around the country, selling their book. I don't mind it. I like visiting new places and meeting lots of people. It's very different from the life I have in the United States when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was good because I didn't have to pay any bills. Everyone was kind to me and it was fun.

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dog. The two smaller sizes first came to England many years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer has not been here very long.

Howard Bonnier is a young Englishman who lives in a village called Bray, which is about fifty kilometres west of London. He has a restaurant called The Palace. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.<eos>"

In the 18th century, London was a big city with many poor people and a lot of thieves. There were no policemen in London at that time. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night.

Later, London became bigger and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers.

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were only interested in the elephant show. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

Victoria Jamieson, a young woman from Britain, started snowboarding at the age of 20. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her recently when she was at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland. We asked her why she started the sport. ""I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.""

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. ""Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We asked her what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!""<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are a few paths to the top. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.

**Questions:**

1. What is the highest mountain in Africa?
2. What is the most popular path to the top of Kilimanjaro?
3. What weather conditions can climbers expect at the top of Kilimanjaro?
4. What items do climbers need to pack for climbing Kilimanjaro?

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. In the past, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for them. But today, there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

**Questions:**

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always smiled and laughed, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.<eos>"

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

Dinosaurs were giant animals that lived long ago. No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.<eos>"

The bear is a powerful animal. It is very strong and can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and running very fast. But they cannot see well and, like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are different kinds of bear. The largest is the white polar bear, which is tall. There are two kinds of black bear: One lives in North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown. Everyone loves the panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is difficult to find food.
