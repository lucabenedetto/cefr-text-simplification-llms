Garbage collection is a ritual that happens regularly in developed countries. In most places, it is free. But if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, we need to make households pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

However, the effects of charging for rubbish disposal are often complex and sometimes disappointing. For example, in one study, it was found that charging for rubbish disposal reduced the weight of rubbish by only 0.3%. This is because people often compacted their rubbish or dumped it illegally. But the study also found that recycling increased by 15%. This is because people chose to recycle rather than pay to have their rubbish carted away.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to enjoy your work, even if you have a high salary or a lot of status.

In order to make work more fulfilling, we need to rethink the way we think about it. We need to move away from traditional categorisations and focus on the relationship between work and our personal well-being. We also need to be more open to new ways of working and new ways of communicating.

If we can all work together to create a more fulfilling work environment, we can all benefit from it.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that is used to spread seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

Television is a technology that is related to various two-way forms of communication. From its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

In the early 1930s, there were a number of attempts to experiment with other forms of organisation. But Big Business agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out.

Television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s. And as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of things doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where you start to buy too much stuff.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. In a musical performance, there are usually people who don't understand the music. Some people are impressed by the skill of the performers, while others are awestruck by the beauty of the music. Theatre audiences have different expectations than concert hall audiences. They don't understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by long speeches. However, they are often generous and willing to try new things. Music and theatre can both be very enjoyable art forms. It would be great if more people could experience the joy of both.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Sometimes, when novels are adapted for film, the writer has to condense or delete parts of the text. This can be frustrating, but it can also be illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a scene, while still getting across the same point.

Watching movies can be a very immersive experience. It can lift you out of yourself and transport you to a world where you are not beholden to ordinary reality. But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is broken and you are back in your ordinary world.

If you dream of making movies, there are a lot of things you can do to make your dream come true. You can read books about scriptwriting and film production, take courses at fashionable universities, or compete in competitions. If you have the talent and the drive, you can make your dream a reality.<eos>"

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other memories, like my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was very lonely and had a strange way of behaving. She had a lot of rules for me, like not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes. There were also other people who lived in West Earlham at that time, like Mrs Buddery, Mrs Winall and Mrs Laband. They formed a group of friends, but they didn't have much to do. My mother was concerned about my education and took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. Here, we would look at paintings and she would make jokes.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others.

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather and the planet. The changes are already happening and they are likely to have a significant impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system and we are not sure how the world will change. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. For example, the average annual global surface temperature has increased by between 1C and 3.5C since 1900. The average sea level has also risen by 15-95 cm. Changes in precipitation patterns are also occurring, with more extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods and droughts becoming more frequent in some places.

Climate change is a serious problem, but it is also an opportunity. Some climate change impacts will probably be beneficial, such as increased food production and the availability of new resources. However, many of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These effects include increased flooding, changes to glacial processes, and rising sea levels.<eos>"

Art is a special form of experience that can be enjoyed in many different ways. It can be enjoyed through the senses, such as seeing and hearing, or through the mind, such as thinking and feeling. When we talk about art, we often think of paintings, sculptures, and other objects that are displayed in museums and galleries. However, this is not the only way to enjoy art. We can also enjoy art through movies, music, and other forms of expression.

In order to understand art, we need to be able to connect it to our own experiences. When we look at a painting or listen to music, we should think about how it makes us feel and how it relates to our own lives. We should also be able to appreciate the beauty and creativity of the artist.<eos>"

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s were probably the toughest of your professional life. There was a recession in business that was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. In Britain, it meant that a lot of people lost their jobs and homes. Every single business in the country was affected. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as the ones who are spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, there has also been a rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, while also adding to their burden.

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed thanks to capitalism.

Some writers make money by writing in the evenings and having other full-time jobs. Others, like me, are literary odd-jobbers who make money from teaching, workshops, and articles.

The actor's craft is a demanding one. Sometimes actors are criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to deliver a convincing performance. However, there are also many actors who are passionate about their craft and work hard to deliver a memorable performance.

When actors are interviewed, they often fall into the trap of talking about their craft in a way that is too self-deprecating or too theoretical. Instead of giving a simple and direct answer, they often use long and rambling sentences that are difficult to understand. This can be frustrating for the interviewer and the audience.

One thing that actors should focus on is their ability to convey emotion. When an actor is able to convey emotion effectively, they can bring a character to life and engage the audience.

Another important aspect of acting is the ability to improvise. Actors who are able to improvise well can react to the unexpected and create a more engaging performance.

Finally, actors should be able to work well with others. When actors are able to work well with others, they can create a more cohesive and effective performance.<eos>"

I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in the story. I have also made sure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be.

Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess.

Oral History

The trend of historians using oral evidence has some problems. It is not always true that someone's testimony is a pure reflection of the past. In an interview, each person is affected by the other person. The historian chooses the informant and tells them what to talk about. Even if the historian does not ask any questions and just listens, the presence of an outsider changes the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. The end product is influenced by the historian's social position and the way they have learned to analyze the past. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lend conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science. One approach is called physiological and the other is called whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works. Those who take the whole animal approach are interested in the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it. There are two main types of animal science: psychology and ethology. Psychologists have traditionally worked in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species. Ethologists have been more concerned with the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals.

The Social Sciences

If you are studying a social science for the first time, you have to do two things at once. You have to learn the substance or content of your new subject and you have to learn the methodology of the subject. The two elements are not separate. They are very closely related. Each social science has its own set of concepts that enable it to go beyond everyday common-sense and distinguish one discipline from another.

It allows people to share their opinions and to help others decide whether or not a book is worth reading.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. Today, we often praise artists for being unique and revolutionary. But sometimes we also get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be different from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

In the past, artists were commissioned to create art for specific purposes. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get cross if they want to come down out of the clouds.

There is a new trend in art today. Artists are choosing to paint pictures of the world of the London Underground. This is because railways hold a peculiar charm for artists.

I am writing about my own art and my own experiences. I believe that art can be a source of comfort and solace. It can help us to reorder and make sense of reality.<eos>"

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past few decades. There are more charts and catalogues now, and telescopes are more accessible. Computers have made it easier to analyze observations and publish results. All this makes it a good time for amateur astronomy.

However, there has also been a loss of things. The skies are not as clear as they once were, and there are more aircraft trails. These things make it harder to see stars and planets.

A map is used to show the relationships between points and features on the Earth's surface. It is determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of a map. The traveller's main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', so the accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop.

Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects.

The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are other birds that also probe for or glean insects from wood. So, the woodpecker niche may not be vacant.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They have evolved such an obvious extravagance because they need to attract mates. The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are trying to settle the matter of whether the peacocks with the showiest trains are also 'better' in other ways. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

The peacocks with the showiest trains attract the most mates. But whether they are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down. There is a final twist to this continuing story. Fisher's Runaway mechanism shows that if females first pick a male with a slightly better tail than the rest, the sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails.<eos>"

Susan has been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires. She has come to believe that we could not do without some gadgets, but we do not need to be dependent on them. There is a wonderfully soothing quality about executing a craft by hand. It is a great satisfaction in watching one's work become neater, more assured.<eos>"

Someone who behaves in a way that is different from others is called eccentric. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. It is the desire to be unique and to do things your own way. Most of us have our own quirks and oddities. It may be a passion for doing something that is not common, a compulsion for collecting things, or a tendency to write letters to the press. Eccentricity is not necessarily a bad thing. It can be a source of strength and creativity. However, if someone's eccentricity becomes too extreme, it can be a problem. If someone is constantly trying to be different, or if they are not able to control their behaviour, it can be difficult for others to deal with.<eos>"

Book reviews can have a significant impact on the commercial success of a book. Publishers and authors have different perspectives on reviews. Publishers rely heavily on reviews to attract readers and generate sales. They often prefer reviews that precisely echo their own response to a book. Authors, on the other hand, are devastated by no reviews, but they are more concerned about the book's content than the number of reviews.

Reviews can be beneficial for both publishers and authors. They can help to generate sales and increase awareness of a book. However, reviews are not the only factor that influences book sales. Other factors include the book's content, the reviewer's reputation, and the book's price.<eos>"

International voluntary work can be a rewarding experience for both volunteers and the communities they serve. However, it is important to be aware of the potential drawbacks and challenges associated with volunteer tourism.

One concern is that volunteer tourism can be exploitative and unequal. If volunteers are not carefully selected and if they are not provided with adequate training and support, they can end up doing more harm than good. Additionally, volunteer tourism can lead to a sense of self-satisfaction and personal gain rather than a genuine desire to help others.

Despite these challenges, volunteer tourism can also have a positive impact on the world. It can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and widespread and democratic participation in global affairs. It can also help to develop people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off.

Overall, volunteer tourism can be a valuable tool for positive change. However, it is important to be aware of its potential drawbacks and challenges and to ensure that volunteer tourism is used responsibly and effectively.<eos>"

Blacksmiths have been making iron products for many years. They are skilled craftsmen who can bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal. In the past, blacksmiths were very important because they made weapons, armour and farming tools. Today, blacksmiths make decorative items, such as gates, balconies and candlesticks. There has been a recent revival in blacksmithing thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design.

The blacksmiths craft is a unique one. Unlike other metals, iron is very soft when it is hot, but it becomes very rigid when it cools down. This makes it a challenging metal to work with, but it also makes it a very expressive one. Many blacksmiths are fascinated by the beauty of iron. They love the way it looks and feels.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you need to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to be mindful of the presence of the camera.

When photographing groups of people, avoid straight lines and arrange people at different angles and distances. To pose people for pictures, help them relax and suggest comfortable positions. You can also ask people to concentrate on something within the picture area.

When photographing individuals, make sure they are not overwhelmed by the background. Use a wide-angle lens to make your subject appear relatively larger than the background. If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be even easier to do.

To capture a good picture of people and places, consider the following tips: show people against a relevant background, use a standard or wide-angle lens, move far enough back to get the whole building or mountain in the frame, and ask your subjects to come fairly close to the camera.<eos>"

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.

To treat imbalances, acupuncturists use fine needles inserted into the skin. They may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches and migraines. It is also sometimes used to relieve pain during surgery.

If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Graphology can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews.

Handwriting can reveal other psychological characteristics, such as whether a person is honest, manipulative, or reliable. It can also be used to predict would-be suicides and other serious problems. However, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them.<eos>"

Is your office working ok? Fresh air and comfortable chairs are the key to a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We went to four different offices to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. We spoke to an expert panel of a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist.

Here are their verdicts. Office A is a small office with a lot of natural light. The air is fresh and the chairs are comfortable. The team of seven people who work there are happy and healthy.

Office B is a comfortable office with good air quality and plenty of space. The chairs are excellent and the lighting is good. However, the office is a bit impersonal and unstimulating.

Office C is a busy office with a lot of activity. The air is not very fresh and the chairs are not very comfortable. However, the staff are supportive and well-served by technology.

Office D is a dusty office with a lot of problems. The air-conditioning control is very crude, the space is cluttered, and the office is very dusty. The staff are stressed and driven by deadlines.<eos>"

The loss of these trees had changed the appearance of the town centre.

I chose film as my area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film.

My role in the public arena is to put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be.<eos>"

It is impossible to guarantee that your checked luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when there is a change of aircraft. To prevent baggage loss, airlines require passengers to check in well before the official time and to allow extra connecting time.

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not able to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a lot of musical ability, they may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.

Specialist music schools in Britain are a relatively new introduction. They provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen to develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find the necessary fees. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a very early age.

If you are considering sending your child to a specialist music school, it is important to weigh the pros and cons. If you think that your child would benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school, you should talk to the schools in your area to learn more about their programs and fees.<eos>"

I love to travel by train. I have many favorite memories of railway journeys. One of my favorite memories is from the south of France. There is a local train that runs from Cannes along the coast and crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes. The train journey is always enchanting, no matter what the weather is like or what time of the year it is.

Another one of my favorite memories is from the Nile Valley Express in northern Sudan. I have enjoyed many rail journeys, but this one is my favorite. It was a family train journey that I missed out on when I was young. I was sent to live with my aunt instead of going on the train.

My third favorite memory is from my honeymoon in France. I took a train to Egypt with my husband. It was a lovely journey through France and then by boat up the Nile River.

My final favorite memory is from my film, which featured a railway in Yorkshire. I made the film on an old, disused stretch of the line. It was a beautiful journey.<eos>"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting for the train to Philadelphia. There were a lot of people waiting. The station was not clean and polished like it usually is. There were elderly couples and college kids. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He asked a woman if she was travelling to Philadelphia. He also asked a girl standing near me if she was travelling to New York. I was thinking of talking to her myself. But he didn't ask me. I understood why he didn't. He seemed unreliable. He went to another person and asked her to help him. The woman was sympathetic. I waited to see what he was going to do. He said he had to stay with his wife because she was in a wheelchair. I didn't think that was a very good excuse. But I let my eyes wander and watched him go away.<eos>"

Finding a good flat in Dublin was like finding gold. The best way was to know someone who knew someone who was leaving a place. If you had just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact. You had to stay in a hostel and search.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go.

There was an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where Jo worked and seemed too good to be true.

She went to the flat and met a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf. The girl was coming down the stairs and said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear.""

They offered her a mug of tea and she stayed for a while.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. We can dream of freedom when we see dolphins. There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The main threats to dolphins are overfishing, pollution, and human disturbance.

Overfishing is a big problem for dolphins because it reduces the amount of food they have to eat. Pollution can also harm dolphins. Waste and other substances found in the sea can build up in the bodies of dolphins. Human disturbance is another problem for dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins.

Dolphins are an important part of the ocean ecosystem. They help to control the population of other animals and they are a source of food for many other creatures. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive.<eos>"

First impressions are often lasting ones. People form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe our dress, eye contact, body movement, voice and words.

Mary worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job because of a small hole in her jacket.

The Head Teacher said that if someone doesn't take the time to present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be? So, it's important to dress professionally and make a good first impression.

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression. Make sure your words agree with your body language and avoid appearing too desperate or eager to please.

Finally, consider what you say and how you say it. If you inform yourself about the company and speak clearly and concisely, you're more likely to be successful in your interview.<eos>"

I like places that have a lot of human elements. When I travel abroad, I often visit lovely villages with old temples. I also like exploring the natural landscape. When I was young, I went to school in England and I would cycle to a village called Lastingham. It was a very special place. I loved exploring the hills and valleys. I also found the landscape familiar yet different. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. That was my first attempt at travel writing.

I also like places that have a lot of ordinary people. There is a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. But there is one point on the journey that I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes.

My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, or with my boyfriend, and now with my son.<eos>"

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site but charge a fee.

The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every place on the earth. Grasslands support a lot of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass, a new meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The railway was built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

My new school is very exciting. It's a new building, and it's also environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so I saw all of it happening. There are five classrooms, a nursery, a dining room, and changing rooms. We also have a big sports field. The school is well designed, so it holds all the heat and sound inside. If we sing inside our classrooms, it sounds like we're in a concert hall. There's also a tree on the roof of the school. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday. It's so big, it can be seen for miles. We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it. But we're so pleased with our new school, and our teachers say we'll all learn much faster now we're in it.<eos>"

My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not very nice, but we had everything we needed. On Saturday morning, I met the other members of our group. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning exploring caves while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was difficult, but after a lot of effort, we were out at last. We were covered in mud, but we were pleased and excited by what we'd done.<eos>"

When I realised I had done that, it was too late. I didn't know what to do. I was 72 years old and I was a long way from home. I was quite worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried.

The shop was very busy and had to be closed soon after it opened. The people outside the shop became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop.

However, it was not the gold seekers that got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge.

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold found in Alaska. Many people came to the area to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the winter, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a track was built that would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail.

Nowadays, there is a dog sled race held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

Since moving to London, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can.<eos>"

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. We were not sure at first, but we eventually gave in. Ben's hobby has been good for our health. Whenever the band starts practising, my husband and I go out for a long walk. The music may sound a little strange, but the band is friendly and polite. They play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet.<eos>"

Last week, I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It is a good place where young people can learn and gain experience. The students, who are between 16 and 18 years old, study in the morning and do activities in the afternoon. These activities include helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, and checking for pollution in rivers. The students come from many different countries and backgrounds. Many of them can only attend because they receive grants. I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people. It is a good place to learn and grow.<eos>"

I am 32 years old and I finished my first year at university. I decided to go to university after many years away from school. I was working as a secretary, but I was bored and unhappy. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in my job. I was jealous of the students at the university, who looked happy and carefree. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. But I am glad that I have this opportunity to study because I know that you need a qualification to get a rewarding job. I prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. I also have the normal student benefits of long holidays and discounts.<eos>"

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he began working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After he had driven it a long way, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model T. It was a cheap car. Ford was soon selling a lot of cars. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.<eos>"

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she climbed the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. Life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink. When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest, it was the best moment of her life. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.<eos>"

Canada Geese are large birds. They live in Canada. When the weather gets cold, the geese have to fly south where the weather is warmer. Last spring, Bill found some young geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also call the police if you see anything strange.<eos>"

In the past, people used to go to the forest to find food. They had to move around a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and build bigger villages. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

We asked Victoria if she had to do a lot of practice. ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m.,"" she said. ""I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all!""

We asked Victoria what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons,"" she said. ""It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!""<eos>"

Dear Mr. or Ms. Jones,

I would like to book a room at your hotel in Manchester for three nights, from September 15th to 17th. I would like a single room with a shower and a telephone in the room. I also need a quiet room on the ground floor. I am going to drive to the hotel. Is there a parking lot for guests? I will arrive at the hotel at about 10.30 p.m. Can you tell me what time the restaurant closes in the evening? If possible, I would like to have a meal when I arrive. Thank you for your help.

Yours sincerely,

Mark Jones<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are different ways to climb Kilimanjaro. The Marangu path is the easiest way. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Not everyone who tries to climb Kilimanjaro reaches the top. This is because the weather can change quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.<eos>"

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. Otters can close their ears and nose. This means they can stay under water for several minutes. In the past, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for them. But today, the rivers are clean again and there is lots of food for otters.<eos>"

Dear John,

Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a very good teacher. I enjoyed my stay in Cambridge. Now I am staying at my brother's flat. He is studying to be a doctor.

Dear David,

I'm going to visit your country next month with two friends. We haven't decided where to stay yet. Can you help us find a place to stay?

I have spoken to my aunt Gloria about you and she says you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house. That will be alright with you, won't it?

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We also build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.<eos>"

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

Dinosaurs were very long ago. No one has ever seen a dinosaur. They lived a long time before people were on the earth. Nobody knows why they all died. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were many different kinds of dinosaurs. Some were small, but others were big. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was very long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.<eos>"

In the past, people used to travel by balloon. In 1783, two French brothers built the first balloon. A long time later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine. It was in the United States. After that, people began to travel by airmail. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. Then, in the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane. It is difficult to imagine a world without them.<eos>"

The Globe Theatre was a long time ago in London. It was different from a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. You can still visit the Globe Theatre today. There is a new theatre there where you can enjoy a Shakespeare play or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.<eos>"

Dear Jeff,

I'm having a good time on holiday in Australia. The weather was bad when we arrived two weeks ago, but now it's better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were all different: red, yellow, purple. Australia is a beautiful country. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
