Garbage collection is a ritual that happens regularly in developed countries. In most places, it is free. But if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To solve this problem, we can charge households for the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

However, the effects of charging for rubbish disposal are often complex. In one study, researchers found that charging for rubbish disposal reduced the weight of rubbish by only 0.3%. This is because people often compacted their rubbish or dumped it illegally. But the study also found that recycling increased by 15%. This is because people chose to recycle rather than pay to have their rubbish removed.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be able to work well with others, and be able to adapt to change.

If you are not satisfied with your current job, there are a few things you can do. You can try to find a new job that is more aligned with your interests and values. You can also try to improve your skills and qualifications so that you can be more competitive in the job market.

However, if you are feeling overwhelmed by your current job, it is important to remember that you are not alone. Many people feel the same way. There are many resources available to help you cope with stress and burnout. If you are struggling to cope, it is important to seek professional help.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

Television is related to other two-way forms of communication. It was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern societies.

In the early 1930s, there were two little-known, distinct alternatives to the way television was organised. One was experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone. The other was various popular science journals that had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers.

But Big Business saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets and centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. The music is like the foundation of an opera. It is what makes the opera what it is. In a musical performance, there are usually people who don't understand the music. But they are still impressed by the skill of the performers. The music can be very theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, and vulnerability. It can also be very expressive and powerful. Sometimes, music can be used to tell a story or express emotions. It can also be used to create a mood or atmosphere.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting information. It can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I noticed that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs.

The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a confusing place. It was made up of many small rooms, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations. To find any particular room was a considerable enterprise. The studio lacked a focus.

And by their united labours, romance and adventure would travel the country.<eos>"

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked down the street. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other memories, like faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, and snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was quite the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street. It meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked. It meant - oh, a hundred proscriptions and prohibitions. As far as I recall, my mother consigned me to the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught occasional glimpses of the world that existed outside West Earlham.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also help us to express sympathy for those who are suffering. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is that it can help us to build trust and social connectedness.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather in all parts of the world. Plants and animals are being affected by these changes, as well as water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not fully understand the processes of the climatic system. We also do not know exactly how the world will change in the future. However, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

Some of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. These include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in glacial processes, and rising sea levels. The consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe, with many people losing their homes and livelihoods.

It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. We also need to develop new technologies to help us adapt to the changing climate.<eos>"

Art is a powerful form of expression that can bring joy and understanding to people. However, sometimes the complexity of art can make it difficult for people to enjoy and understand. When art is separated from its connection to human experience, it becomes isolated and difficult to relate to. To understand art, we need to forget it for a time and turn aside from it. Instead, we need to focus on the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. Once we have done this, we can begin to appreciate art in its raw, unrefined form.<eos>"

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s were probably the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. In Britain, it meant that a lot of people lost their jobs and homes. Every single business in the country was affected. Some businesses found themselves down by 30%. A lot of people and companies suffered.

Advertising people often feel particularly under pressure because they are seen as the ones who are spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, despite all of these challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want. This has increased the status of marketing people, but also added to their burden.

Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there's some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Reading a great book guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored.

The craft of acting can be challenging and rewarding. Sometimes, actors are criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to deliver a convincing performance. However, there are also many actors who work hard to improve their craft and who are passionate about their work.

Kinetic art is a type of art that is concerned with movement. There has been a new exhibition in London that traces the history of kinetic art in the twentieth century. The exhibition reveals that making artworks that move or investigate the idea of movement has been a consistent theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. Visitors to the exhibition can make connections and discoveries for themselves.

The exhibition includes works by David Hockney, a popular artist. Hockney's work is figurative and easy to understand. It also provides an escape from the mundanities of everyday life. However, some critics believe that Hockney is overrated. They argue that his work lacks substance. Hockney himself is aware of his limitations and does not claim to be a great artist.

The exhibition also includes works by other artists, such as Sam Cole and Matthew Crawley. Cole's knitted cats chase each other around a toy train track. Crawley's work involves turning on a video camera and poking around in it until it breaks. These works do not fit into the 'an exhibition exploring the theme of...' category, but they are included in the exhibition because they relate to the theme of kinetic art.<eos>"

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world and distant parts of the solar system. It has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Photography has changed radically since its invention in 1839. It has moved into what might be termed 'mythic time' and has passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document.<eos>"

Writing poetry is like playing a game. You need to be spontaneous and creative, but also be aware of the risks. If you try to be too perfect, you might make a mess of things. To write well, you need to read a lot, write a lot, and use your imagination. You can also find inspiration from others. Some people write to express their feelings, others write to tell stories. There are different ways to write poetry, but the most important thing is to find your own style.

In a short story, there is no room for too many characters or long narratives. Keep your story short and focused. Use flashbacks sparingly and only if they are necessary. Dialogue is more important than longwinded explanations. Keep your writing concise and to the point.

It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature.<eos>"

The way historians use stories from people's memories is not always perfect. Sometimes, people's memories are not accurate or they are influenced by other things, such as their feelings or their own experiences.

It is important for historians to accept responsibility for their part in creating new evidence.

There are two main ways to study animals. One way is to focus on how the body works. The other way is to study the behaviour of the whole animal. Within the second way, there are two main types of study: psychology and ethology. Psychologists study the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists study the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals.

The Social Sciences

If you are studying a social science for the first time, you have to learn two things at the same time. You have to learn the substance or content of your new subject and you have to learn the methodology of the subject. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related.

Sometimes, Lily would drive very fast and make a big bump. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily was able to drive. They made plans to go on a journey. They decided to leave early in the morning and return by midday. They drove to the English Channel. Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back, had to admit that. They drove along the empty promenade. They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was worried about the road markings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away. The girls were angry. Lily accused her husband of being ungrateful. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances. Chen took Man Kee to the eyepiece. He showed Man Kee the ship. Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. The ship was gone. Chen was sad. He drove on.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often criticize art for being too flashy or not traditional. Sometimes, the media tells us what art is and we agree with them. We expect artists to be different from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

There is a new artist named Eric Rimmington who is doing something different. He is painting the London Underground. He has a new show called Underground Encounters. The paintings and drawings in the show convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.

Rimmington's new show is a testament to the power of art to heal and inspire. It is a reminder that art can be used to bring joy and beauty into the world.<eos>"

Simon Costello knew that the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession that was only affordable by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these things could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. She had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise. The overcrowded tube journey was a mood of envious resentment and brooding. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead and his grandmother's advice. He remembered every word of her angry accusations. If only he'd had some warning. He knew now what he should have said.

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine.

They also need to know quite a bit about quite a number of things and be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy.

There are some activities that take a long time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient and add the oil too quickly, the mayonnaise curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can be speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot be rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line.

The mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. The second is thought itself. The third is slower than thought. This slower mode of thinking is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy.<eos>"

Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past fifty years. In the past, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there are many telescopes and equipment that you can buy. Computers have made it easier to make almanacs and charts. They have also made it easier to analyze observations and publish results. All this makes this a good time for amateur astronomy.

However, there has also been a loss. Now you have to travel farther to find a sky that is comparable to the sky in urban areas fifty years ago. The daytime skies are now filled with aircraft condensation trails which can last for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Society is also becoming more complex. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. This can be stressful. People are becoming more disconnected from life. The desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction. Technology simply accelerates the pace of change.

But there is also a new trend. People are looking for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. Simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. However, there are some basic things that you can do to simplify your life.

McAndrews Hotel

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition that has been going on for many years. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days.<eos>"

Othello The transfer of a production of Shakespeare's play Othello to London from Stratford allows me to make amends for an unfair review I wrote last spring. I complained that the actor Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role, but I think it's a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona. However, I appreciate Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. The whole cast is magnificent. There are some memorable scenes in the play, such as the one where Cassio's games get out of hand and the moment when Iago loses control. The pace and tension throughout the play are terrific.

A map is used to show the relations of points and features on the Earth's surface. It is determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of a map. The traveller's main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', so the accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs, realistic or conventional, and varied in size to indicate their importance. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content. Today, cartography is used in many sciences, such as geology, history, and geography. It is also used to show distributions of various things, such as geological strata and climatic regimes.<eos>"

Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself.

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another plane from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the students took their places. The flight was smooth, but the engines strained wildly, and the passengers were scattered across the cabin floor. After a few seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The students were excited and exhilarated. They felt like they were floating aimlessly in space. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.<eos>"

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have been looking after orphaned animals ever since. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet and their eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. They were cold and whimpering. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.

The cubs were fed every four hours and they progressed to drinking from a bottle and moving around within a week. After a few weeks, I noticed that one of the cubs, Willow, was not doing well. He died from a lung infection. I was sad but I continued rearing the other two cubs.

A few days later, I found another male cub that had been abandoned by its mother. I called him Willow II. He was much younger than the females and it was difficult to feed him. But eventually, I managed to get him to eat and he joined the fold.

The cubs grew and thrived. They were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. They also started to dig for earthworms.

As the weather got colder, the cubs began to turn nocturnal. They would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. I would often go with them and sometimes my husband would join me. We would chase each other's tails and have a lot of fun.

One day, I spotted some odder badgers in our field. They were probably looking for food. I was warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so I placed sheet metal over the gate to make it inaccessible.

We started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With the help of local businesses and a bus company, we were able to raise enough money to build the sett. The badgers moved into their new home and are doing well.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley led a remarkable life. He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. He also developed a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton during his writing of Principia Mathematica.

Dr. Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip. He will retrace the route of the Paramore and make measurements that Halley made. These measurements need to be updated because the terrestrial magnetic field is slowly but constantly changing. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.<eos>"

Peacocks that live in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire, UK, show off their beautiful trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin believed that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection.

The peacocks' tail is not necessarily advantageous. It is a waste of space and can be a severe encumbrance. Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'. Females like showy males, so the males with the showiest trains attract the most mates.

But the question remains - do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt? Scientists are still studying this mystery.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.

Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities exist between humans and animals. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. Monkeys also have a simple one-word language.

As for art, the earliest forms of human art may have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. The earliest evidence for human art is the famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces and musical instruments that were created by the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago.

Human art is often described as non-utilitarian, aesthetic pleasure, and learned. However, there are some similarities between human art and animal activities. For example, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions and were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Book reviews play an important role in the success of books. Publishers and authors have different perspectives on reviews. Publishers rely on reviews to attract readers and generate sales. They often prefer positive reviews, as they believe that they can increase sales. Authors, on the other hand, are devastated by no reviews. They need reviews to promote their books and build their reputations.

Reviews can have a significant impact on book sales. A good review can launch a book and a career. However, it is not the only factor that influences sales. Other factors include word-of-mouth recommendations, the book trade, and marketing.

The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is complex. It is different from the relationship in the United States. In Britain, reviews are not always taken as seriously. It sometimes takes a long time for a book to gain popularity, even if it has received positive reviews.<eos>"

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he tries to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played on a board, but much of modern chess is played off the board. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire.<eos>"

International voluntary work can be a rewarding experience for both volunteers and the communities they serve. However, there are some concerns about the impact of volunteer tourism on developing countries.

One concern is that volunteer tourism can be exploitative. When volunteers pay a fee to participate in a project, the money often ends up benefiting the volunteer organization rather than the local community. This can be especially problematic for gap years, where volunteers may not have the skills or experience needed to make a significant contribution to the community.

Another concern is that volunteer tourism can be isolating. If volunteers are not able to interact with the local community, they may not be able to fully experience the benefits of their volunteer work. This can be especially problematic for volunteers who are working on long-term projects.

Despite these concerns, volunteer tourism can also have a positive impact on developing countries. For example, volunteering can lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and widespread and democratic participation in global affairs. It can also help to develop people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off.<eos>"

One technique is to make the store look fresh and inviting. They may have fresh fruit and vegetables at the front of the store, or a display of flowers. They may also have a bakery that smells like fresh bread. The store's fixtures may also be colored to make the store look fresh.

Another technique is to make the products look more desirable. They may display the products in a way that makes them look like they are more expensive than they are. They may also use bright lights to make the products look more appealing.

A third technique is to make the store layout more confusing. They may spread low-priced staples around the store, making it difficult for shoppers to find the items they need. They may also use different carpeting to guide shoppers along a certain path.

The training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya. The athletes live in cinder-block dormitories and train three times a day. The daily regime begins at six in the morning and includes a leisurely run, interval training, and a steady run in the late afternoon.

The athletes eat a simple diet of tea, bread, eggs, ugali, stew, and cabbage. When the day's running is over, the athletes relax and bathe in the streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.

By the time Nerurkar left the camp, he was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. He couldn't stop himself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps these are the secrets, perhaps these are the real reasons behind Kenya's rise to the top of world distance running.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has not been able to keep up with the pace of economic change. As a result, most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised.

When you're watching TV, you probably see a lot of commercials for brands you don't buy. Most people only register a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest. This is called waste.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved that it is. Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all.

So, if you are an advertiser, you need to make sure your advertising campaign is tightly targeted. If you can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population), you will be doing well.<eos>"

He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that they were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we use software to edit our digital images.

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability to find water. She can hold a forked hazel stick above the ground and detect water. She is very busy these days because there has been a lot of drought. Most of her customers are farmers with wells that have dried up. To find water, Margaret needs nothing more than a forked hazel stick. She starts by looking at a map of the area and then walks over the fields with her stick. If she finds water, she will reel slightly and use the stick to locate the exact spot where they should drill. If she and her husband disagree on the location of the water, they will keep looking until they agree.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you have to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to be aware of the camera's effect on these.

To photograph people effectively, you should follow these steps:

1. Group people in a way that is visually appealing.
2. Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
3. Avoid making it seem like you are taking a picture when you are not.
4. Make eye contact with your subject or have them concentrate on something within the picture area.
5. Use expressions and gestures to convey the subject's mood.
6. Consider the background of your subject and make sure it is relevant to the picture.
7. Include interaction between people in your shot.
8. Take pictures of people in their environment to show where they were.

By following these steps, you can take better pictures of people.<eos>"

Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. There is a debate about whether it is ethical to use UGC without permission. Research shows that a lot of people film or photograph news events. This means that UGC has a big part to play in the future of the media.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most popular.

Acupuncture points are located along meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.

To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin at specific points on the meridians. They may also use warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on the meridians.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.

If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.

Handwriting can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.

A professional graphologist, Patricia Marne, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks the plants and takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow.

Film critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. It was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a lot of other ideas. One of his ideas was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided they should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt self-confident. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of his reviews appeared, he knew where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but it didn't work out as planned. Mark chose film as his area of focus.

People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Some people collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. I have been collecting all my life. Everything from flowers to pottery and paintings. My first collection was of stones picked up in my parents' garden. I was fascinated by these objects. I am not alone in being interested in collecting objects. One in three adults indulges the same passion.

I have collected items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember the day that I persuaded a fellow collector of tulips to part with one which I wanted to add to my collection. I planted it and watered it until one year it vanished - stolen by another collector. One collection that I made was of American rag dolls - 350 of them. I looked all over the USA for these dolls, searching out each variation in design with delight. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire.

Rita was small like the children from Marie's class. Marie's daddy showed her how to make gloves. The gloves were very hot and shiny. Marie called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita was interested in every last detail. She took notes and asked questions.

The leather industry is a very old industry. It has been around for thousands of years. The first clothing was just skins that were tanned by smoking them. Seymour's father is the leather scholar. He knows a lot about the leather industry. If you want to learn about gloves, you should talk to Seymour's father.<eos>"

If you are unhappy with your job, you can talk to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then give you a summary of the findings from a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on this, they will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Last March, Donna Laney lost her job and decided to go to Career Analysts for help. She was told that she had a gift for design and that she should balance the cost of retraining in design against her financial commitments. Donna decided to use the skills she already had and move into something more suited to her than insurance.

If you are feeling stuck in your job and need some advice, you should consider talking to a careers adviser. However, it is important to remember that careers advice doesn't work for everyone.<eos>"

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright paintings on the wall and a comfortable blue couch. Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist. To make people feel more relaxed, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. He has a lot of relaxation techniques, such as virtual-reality headsets and a pleasant smell in the surgery. He also uses a special instrument that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. He found out that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.<eos>"

Chocolate, which is made in South America, is popular in many countries. People in Britain spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter and Christmas. The cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztecs, Toltecs and Mayans over three thousand years ago. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate. In the past, chocolate was made from solid blocks that had to be melted down in hot water. But now, chocolate is made from chocolate powder or bars. The latest marketing trick is the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert.<eos>"

They have spent a lot of time preparing for their work. They cleared away the undergrowth, found bits of gold in the rocks, and got permission for their work from the owners. They also removed old cars and rubbish. Now they are running short of money.

I was dirty, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. The train ticket allowed me to travel all over Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've slept in the corridor of a train. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel. It encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks and getting rid of books when finished. But this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. You can travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. Only by actually seeing Europe, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind.<eos>"

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not there, you will have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage, even the best ones. It is impossible to guarantee that your luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when there is a change of aircraft. To make sure your luggage arrives safely, you should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you have to change planes, try to fly the same airline throughout and allow more connecting time. If your luggage is still missing after all this, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR).<eos>"

For older children, there are scarier rides, such as Splash Out. After five hours, Steve and I were ready to call it a day, but the children objected because they were having such fun.

Wonderland is another popular theme park. It has a lot of rides for all ages. The older children enjoyed the ferris wheel and the toy cars. We spent six hours there and were glad that there were places where you could put your feet up.

Adventure World is a well-designed theme park. It has a lot of rides for younger children, such as Toy Land and Running River. The park is so well designed that even queuing for rides isn't too boring.

The Great Park is a small theme park that is perfect for younger children. It has a lot of rides that are not too terrifying. We all adored Exotic Travels, a boat ride which starts off quite tamely and then becomes terrific fun.<eos>"

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not able to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a lot of musical ability, they may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.

There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

The main disadvantages of attending a specialist music school are the cost and the fact that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. If you are considering sending your child to a specialist music school, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks the plants and takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common kinds of dolphin. Bottlenoses are particularly social and live in groups. They are often seen flashing quickly past ships.

One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are removed from an area, dolphins may not be able to find enough food to survive. Human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and other sources can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.

Dolphins are an important part of the ocean ecosystem. They help to regulate the food chain and they are a source of joy for people all over the world. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive.<eos>"

A. Annika Reeder won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to become a physiotherapist and compete at the next Olympics. It's hard to be a gym star, but you have to be very dedicated and work hard.

B. Annika's mother said, ""From an early age, Annika showed tremendous potential. To perform at the level she does is very demanding. But it's also very rewarding.""

C. Sarah Stokes made her first show-jumping appearance at ten. She has won the British National Championship. Show-jumping is a fun and exciting sport. You have to be very talented and well-trained to be successful.

D. Sarah's mother said, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse, she knew she loved it. To qualify for major shows, you have to jump all over England. It's expensive to travel, so we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box.""

E. Jane McShane is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. Chess is a friendly and fun game. You have to be very smart and focused to be successful.

F. Jane's mother said, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. If she has this gift, let her fulfil her potential.""<eos>"

Chris Greener was tall when he was fourteen. He is the tallest man in Britain today. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors used to eat a wide variety of foods, but today we mostly eat three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. The problem is that we cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.<eos>"

Studio audiences are a common feature of television life. They are made up of people from all classes, professions and income groups. People go to studio audiences for different reasons. Some people hope to appear on television, others are curious to take a look behind the scenes, and still others just want to have fun.

When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with AUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. It may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.

Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.<eos>"

Bruce likes landscapes that have a human element. He finds it important to have people in the landscape. When he travels abroad, he likes to visit lovely villages with old temples. He also likes to explore the countryside. He finds the landscape familiar yet different from his home in Scotland. He used to describe his adventures in his private diary. That was his first attempt at travel writing.

Sophia likes a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. She always travels first class. The scenery is not spectacular. But there is one point on the journey that she always looks forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. She sees herself in the eyes of the people who live in the houses.

Matthew likes the Hartland Peninsula. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys.

Annette likes the Trough of Bowland. It's a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and she likes the feeling of space.

James purchased Glenthorne, his favourite house in Britain. It's a magic, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except sea, wind and birds.<eos>"

In our busy world, people use phones, fax machines and computers to communicate. But there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and the enjoyment of the contents.

I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mom when I was young. My mom also taught me to write thank-you letters for Christmas and my birthday. I would write to my mom and dad once a week when I went to London to train as a doctor. Sometimes my dad would write and it was always a joy to receive his letters.

I also have penfriends from all over the world. I have one penfriend in Sri Lanka, one in Australia, one in Vancouver and one in France. I love receiving letters from my penfriends. They make me feel happy and connected to the world.

I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition of letter writing. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mom. My son has penfriends of his own in Texas, organised by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 'lost art'.<eos>"

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site but charge a fee.

The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there. If we do not take steps, the drawings will be lost for future generations.<eos>"

Young shoppers often go to the supermarket with their parents. Sometimes, they want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Sometimes, parents have a lot of trouble deciding what to buy. They feel guilty if they say no to their children's demands. And they feel bad if they give in to their children's demands. Sometimes, parents are inconsistent and hypocritical. They refuse to buy their children sweets but they buy double cream and chocolate for themselves. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict. They could remove sweets from checkout areas or provide supervised play areas.<eos>"

Once upon a time, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, there is a climber named Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators. But the TV show and the World Cup Climbing Championships share one thing - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. Before, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. But now, there are many sports centres that have climbing walls. These walls are made of bricks with special edges that climbers can hold on to. You can climb on these walls all year round. But there are some problems with climbing walls. They can only be built in a vertical plane. And they can get tiring to climb. But there is a new type of climbing wall that solves these problems. It is made of steel and has interchangeable fixtures. This type of climbing wall is perfect for climbers of all levels.<eos>"

But it's a personal choice and only you can take responsibility for yourself. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You need luck and talent. There is a demand for new faces and new talent. Acting is all about making contact with the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted.

Sometimes, these pictures can be very damaging to the people who are pictured. However, very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is an organization that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The PCC has not launched an investigation into any of the recent stories about celebrities' privacy. This is a scandal. The PCC should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. If the PCC decided to take on the role of 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. However, there is no easy solution to this serious problem.<eos>"

If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious career planning. Most important, it should extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility.

If you are thinking of travelling, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system, and are not likely to go off again.<eos>"

Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.'

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every place on the earth. Grasslands support a lot of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass, a new meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb, probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain. You need spikes for your boots because the snow is very hard. There was a lot of safety equipment, including lights, hats and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, there was still a feeling of nervousness when they set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The track was steep and the legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, Keith had to rest more frequently. After a long climb, they reached the top. You can see the sea and the island of Skye from the top. However, there was a mist and it was not a clear day. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly.

We had come from different places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was difficult, but after a lot of pushing, we were out at last. We were covered in mud, but we were pleased and excited by what we'd done.<eos>"

On Saturday afternoon, I was on the bus. I left my handbag on the bus. It contained a lot of money and some credit cards. When I realized that I had lost my handbag, I was very worried. I didn't know what to do. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely. The manager of CityBus called me soon after. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day.<eos>"

I was nervous at my first ballet class because I didn't know anyone. Everyone was friendly and asked me questions. I tried to say something in Russian, but they began talking in English. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me and my Russian has improved a lot. I feel at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops.

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in the winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. They were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as the first part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The hotel melts in the spring. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC. Guests need to wear warm clothes and socks. If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website. You can also order equipment and book your visit at the same time. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. You can get there by bus from the airport or train station.<eos>"

Last Thursday, there was a lot of people shopping for furniture at Homestyle, a new furniture shop. The shop was very busy and had to be closed soon after it opened. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa and a bed. The shop's normal hours are 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced that it wouldn't close at all for the first 24 hours. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and refused to queue quietly. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. This meant that the road was then completely blocked. One customer, Jenny Smith, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They didn't have any choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.'<eos>"

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold found in Alaska. Many people came to the area to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the winter, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a track was built that would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at places called roadhouses where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead. The trip covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey.<eos>"

In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists and painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings.

Aitchison says that anyone can do the colours. You can buy the colours and simply notice what you put the colours next to. He doesn't do drawings before he starts a painting because he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not do the painting afterwards. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she climbed the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. Life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink. When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.<eos>"

Simplified text: 'Canada Geese are big blue and white birds. In the fall, they fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are very cold in Canada, so the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill found some young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the fall.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in the fall, Bill flew to the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in the United States and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to the United States to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.'<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also call the police if you see anything strange.<eos>"

In the past, people used to go to the forest to find food. They had to move around a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and their villages grew bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bait on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bait. They are small.

I also need a quiet room on the ground floor. I am going to drive to the hotel. Is there a parking lot for guests? I will arrive at the hotel at about 10.30 p.m. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? If possible, I would like to have a meal when I arrive. Thank you for your help.

Yours faithfully,

Mark Jones<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are different ways to climb Kilimanjaro. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Not everyone who tries to climb Kilimanjaro gets to the top. This is because the weather can change quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.<eos>"

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. Otters can close their ears and nose. This means they can stay under water for several minutes. In the past, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for the otters. But today, there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.<eos>"

Dear John,

Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a very good teacher. I enjoyed my stay in Cambridge. Now I am staying at my brother's flat. He is studying to be a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go home to Greece. I like London very much. We travelled to Regent's Park by bus yesterday. It was very sunny and we had a good time. Tonight, I am going to see a film with my brother and some of his friends. I'll write again from Greece. Best wishes, Kostas.<eos>"

Dear David,

I'm going to visit your country next month with two friends. We haven't decided where to stay yet. Can you help us find a place to stay?

I have spoken to my aunt Gloria about you and she said you can stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house. That will be good, won't it?

David, I'm waiting for your answer.

Sincerely,

[Your name]<eos>"

Simplified text: 'People have always built buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We also use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass. '

Hi Indre, I have a problem. I need your help to go shopping tomorrow. My grandmother is turning 80 next month and she is having a party on Saturday. The problem is that all my trousers are too short for me now. I need to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots. I haven't got a lot of money, but I think it will be enough. Would you like to meet me in the morning or the afternoon? Let me know. Sarika<eos>"

Simplified text: 'Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. There are a lot of green hills and fields between the two towns. There is a picture of a very large man on one of the hills. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think that it was a long time ago. To get closer to the picture, you can walk from Cerne. If you go on the first of May when the sun comes up, you will see all the people from the village dancing around the man on the hill. '<eos>"

Gail Rollins is a runner from Edinburgh. She is very good at running. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres and the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for coming second in big competitions. But she always smiled and laughed, and people in her home city loved her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.<eos>"

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were many different kinds. Some were small, but others were big. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was very long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong.

The Globe Theatre was a very different place to visit 400 years ago. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. You can still visit the Globe Theatre today. There is a new theatre there where you can enjoy a Shakespeare play or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.<eos>"

Dear Jeff,

I'm having a good time in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were different there: red, yellow, and purple. Australia is a beautiful country. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
