Garbage collection is a ritual that happens regularly in many countries. In most places, it is free. But if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To solve this problem, we can charge households for the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

However, the effects of charging for rubbish disposal are often complex. In one study, researchers found that charging for rubbish disposal reduced the weight of rubbish by only 0.3%. This is because people often compacted their rubbish or dumped it illegally. But the study also found that recycling increased by 15%. This is because people chose to recycle rather than pay to have their rubbish removed.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to enjoy your work, even if you have a high salary or a lot of status.

There are a few things you can do to make your work more fulfilling. First, you need to find a job that you are passionate about. Second, you need to be able to communicate effectively with your colleagues and clients. Third, you need to be able to be creative and problem-solving. Finally, you need to be able to work well with others.

If you are able to do all of these things, you will be more likely to be successful and satisfied with your work.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that is used to spread seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

Television is a technology that is related to other two-way forms of communication. It was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern societies.

In the early 1930s, there were two little-known, distinct alternatives to the way that television was organised. One was experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone. The other was various popular science journals that had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers.

But Big Business saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets and centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states.<eos>"

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. The music is like the foundation of an opera. It is what makes the opera what it is. In the theatre, the word and the actor speaking it have primacy. There is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way. The audience and the performer meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere.

Sometimes, music can be very theatrical. It can be full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, and grandeur. But sometimes, music can also be very disruptive. It can be difficult to hear and understand. It can also be very expensive. There are a lot of things being done to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Sometimes, when novels are adapted for film, the writer has to condense or delete parts of the story. This can be frustrating, but it can also be illuminating. When I was working on a script, I noticed that I could get across the same point with less dialogue and description. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description in the original novel were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs.

The studio where I worked was a big place. It was hard to find your way around. There were many different buildings and rooms. It was also confusing because there were no clear signs or directions. To find your way around, you had to use a surrealist system of digits and letters.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other memories, like my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was very lonely and had a strange way of behaving. Sometimes she would get angry and clean the house or wash her hands. Sometimes she would be very quiet and listen to the radio. My mother was also very strict. She had a lot of rules about how I should behave. I had to sit for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with my hands folded across my chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked. It was difficult to follow all of her rules, but I tried to do my best.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also help us to express our emotions, such as sadness, anger, or happiness. Sometimes, we cry because we are helpless. If we are sad, angry, or scared, we may cry to show that we need help. Sometimes, we cry because we are happy. If we hear inspiring music or see a moving film, we may cry. Finally, crying can also be a sign of involuntary reaction. If we hear something that makes us feel sad or surprised, we may cry involuntarily.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing changes to the weather and the planet. The changes are already happening and they are having a big impact on plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to their advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

The problem is that we do not know exactly how the world will change. We do know that human action has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases are causing the Earth's temperature to rise. The rising temperatures are also causing changes to the weather and the planet.

The changes to the weather and the planet are having a big impact on many things. For example, they are causing changes to the location of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands. They are also causing changes to the availability of water and food. The changes are also causing changes to glacial processes and sea levels.

The consequences of climate change are potentially very severe. They could include increased flooding and inundation, changes to ecosystems, and the loss of homes and livelihoods. The consequences could also include the displacement of millions of people and the loss of entire countries.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.<eos>"

The craft of acting is sometimes criticized. Sometimes actors are blamed for their own mistakes. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' Instead of talking about their craft, actors often fall into cliches or gossip. We should all pay attention to what Paul Scofield said in a letter to a friend of mine: 'I have found that an actor's work has life and interest only in its execution. It seems to wither away in discussion and become emptily theoretical and insubstantial. It has no rules (except perhaps audibility). With every play and every playwright the actor starts from scratch, as if he or she knows nothing and proceeds to learn afresh every time growing with the relationships of the characters and the insights of the writer.'

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the theatre creates a relationship between the performer and the audience. The proportions of an auditorium are important. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage.<eos>"

Kinetic art is a type of art that is concerned with movement. There has been a new exhibition in London that traces the history of kinetic art in the twentieth century. The exhibition reveals that making artworks that move or investigate the idea of movement has been a consistent theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. Visitors to the exhibition can make connections and discoveries for themselves.

The exhibition includes works by David Hockney, a popular artist. Hockney's work is figurative and easy to understand. It also provides an escape from the mundanities of everyday life. Some people like Hockney because he is engaging and has a good sense of humor. Others like him because his art is beautiful.

The exhibition also includes works by other artists, such as Sam Cole and Matthew Crawley. Cole's knitted cats go barmy chasing each other round on a toy train track.

Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for its intrinsic interest.

This means that potential buyers can see what other readers think of a book, for better or worse. However, there are some problems with this system. For example, some people write fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people write reviews that are too long or too silly. But overall, the reviews on Amazon are a valuable resource for book buyers. They provide a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book is worth buying.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, people used art for specific purposes, like commissions. Today, artists are more free to do their own thing. But sometimes, people get upset when artists try to do something new. This is because we expect artists to stick to one style. If an artist changes their style, people often feel let down.

There is a new artist named Eric Rimmington who is doing something different. He is painting the London Underground. He has a new show called Underground Encounters. The paintings and drawings in the show are about the strange and magical world of the London Underground.

Rimmington's paintings are simple and direct. They are not flashy or charming. They are like the paintings that you would see in a museum. The paintings are also very calming and peaceful. They can make you feel relaxed and happy.<eos>"

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It can bore through wood and find insects. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way into the wood and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop.

Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye finds the insects. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects.

Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley was one of only two men in the land at that time who were paid to conduct scientific research. He set sail for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination.

The boat has a lot of new technology, but it also has some old-fashioned features. It is a beautiful boat, but it is also very expensive.

My own boat is much simpler. It is a small boat that is designed for sailing in the tide. It is not very comfortable, but it is easy to sail. I love my boat because it is simple and because it is fun to sail.<eos>"

In the past, humans and chimpanzees were very similar. We have not had time to develop any differences since we separated from chimpanzees. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.

Art is not only used for communication but also for aesthetic pleasure. Humans have a lot of different art forms, such as painting, drawing, music, and dance. Some animals also have art forms. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as eating utensils and weapons, and sea otters use rocks to crack open clams.

Human art is different from animal art because it is non-utilitarian and it is learned rather than instinctive. Human art is also used for aesthetic pleasure.<eos>"

International voluntary work can be a rewarding experience for both volunteers and the communities they serve. However, there are some important things to consider when volunteering.

One concern is that volunteer tourism can be exploitative and not benefit the local community. If volunteers are not careful, they can end up doing more harm than good. For example, if volunteers donate money to a local community instead of working with them to build homes or schools, it can be more effective in the long run.

Another concern is that volunteering can be biased towards wealthy individuals. If volunteers are only from wealthy areas, they may not be able to understand the needs of the local community. This can also lead to problems, such as volunteers making assumptions about what the local community needs.

Finally, volunteer tourism can be used to promote unsustainable development. If volunteers are not careful, they can end up contributing to the problem of poverty and inequality. For example, if volunteers build schools in a community that does not have enough teachers or resources, it can be more effective in the long run.<eos>"

It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice.""

However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I'm because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money.""

C. Annabel is a rower. She says, ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level.""

D. Ffyona is a long-distance walker. She says, ""I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record!""

E. Lisa is a saloon car racer. She says, ""Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport.""<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has not been able to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertising is not effective because it is not able to target specific audiences. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Advertising is still cost-effective because it is a cheap means of mass communication. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all.<eos>"

They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The pictures are beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography.

Blacksmiths have been making iron products for many years. They have been skilled craftsmen and have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as important as doctors and astrologers. They made weapons, armour and farming tools. They also made artistic pieces.

In the past few years, there has been a revival of blacksmithing. This is because there is a greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to new power tools.

The exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) is a popular event. It showcases a wide range of pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase. The prices for the pieces range from PS90 to four figures.

Many blacksmiths find that working with iron is magical. It is soft when it is hot, but it becomes rigid and immovable when it cools down. This makes it a challenging and rewarding medium to work with.<eos>"

The end of print may take some time. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change can be frightening and challenging, but it also means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Newspapers are facing a decline in sales, but their websites are going higher. The decline in print sales is happening in many countries, but it is not happening at the same rate. There are a lot of factors that can affect the decline of print sales, such as timing, demography, geography and more. Books are also facing a decline in sales, but e-readers are booming. The decline in book sales is not as dramatic as some people might think. There are still a lot of people who read newspapers and books. And, print is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you have to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to be aware of the camera's effect on these.

To photograph people well, you should:

* Group people at different angles and distances.
* Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
* Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
* Ask your subject to look into the lens.
* Use expressions and gestures that tell us more about the subject.
* Show the subject against a relevant background.
* Take pictures of people in action.
* Balance the subjects and the place they were visiting.<eos>"

In the workplace, there are new rules for success. These rules are not based on how clever you are or your training and expertise, but on how well you handle yourself and others. To be successful, you need to have good social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness. These skills are commonly referred to as emotional intelligence.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor and regulate your own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. It includes basic elements such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships.

More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a key component of management philosophy. If you have a job that requires you to work with others, then emotional intelligence is essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world.

You can learn and improve your emotional intelligence skills through experience and practice. Studies have shown that most people grow more adept at handling their own emotions and impulses, at motivating themselves and at honing their empathy and social adroitness over time.<eos>"

The media can earn money from content they don't own. Social media has made it easier to share news stories. Sometimes, journalists use pictures from social media to report on the news. Unfortunately, some reporters have published pictures that were not theirs. There is a debate about whether it is ethical to use pictures from social media without permission. Many people film or photograph news events. This means that UGC has a big part to play in the future of the media. To keep the public's trust, the media needs to make sure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.

Handwriting can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.

A professional graphologist, Patricia Marne, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. She also has a come-what-may attitude to the garden. With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently.<eos>"

My first job as a writer was writing articles about films for The Front Page newspaper. Before that, I had done some reviewing of novels and films. I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch where we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. I was lacking self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of my reviews appeared, I didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned. Everything was done by phone. I chose film because the general public preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area. Without Tom's initial push, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement.<eos>"

The National Trust is an organisation that protects the beautiful areas in the British countryside. Gareth Roberts is a warden who works for the Trust. He says that a National Trust Warden needs to have common sense and be good at handling people. Gareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and he has a lot of experience farming. He won the job because he has a lot of local knowledge and farming experience.

Gareth's job is to make sure that the work gets finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. He also enjoys talking to the public. But he doesn't like it when people are rude or demanding.

If you have plenty of common sense and you like the idea of an outdoor job, you might think of applying to become a warden like Gareth.<eos>"

If a child has a special musical ability, it is important to help them develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. If a school does not have the resources to deal with children who are musically gifted, it may be helpful to send the child to a specialist music school.

There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

The cost of attending a specialist music school is high, but there are scholarships and other forms of financial assistance available. Not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, and there are concerns about the pressure and stress that can be associated with such an environment. However, all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils and offer help and advice if needed.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish. Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. She also has a come-what-may attitude to the garden. With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently.<eos>"

There were a lot of elderly couples and college kids. A man was walking around talking to different strangers. He looked well-off. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. He also came over to me and asked me if I was travelling to Philadelphia. I said yes, but he didn't ask me to go with him. He was probably worried about his daughter.

Jo felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. She was heading off on her own.

There was a hostel in Dublin that Jo stayed in. It was run by nuns. It was very near the post office where she worked. The flat was not in the basement, it was upstairs.

One day, Jo was walking to the post office and she saw a cheerful-looking girl coming down the stairs. The girl was talking to herself and she seemed to be very unhappy. Jo went on climbing and she met the girl. They talked for a while and they offered her a cup of tea.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. We often see dolphins in movies and TV programs. However, dolphins are facing a lot of problems. One problem is pollution. Pollution can be harmful to dolphins. It can cause them to get sick or die. Another problem is overfishing. Overfishing is reducing the number of fish in the ocean. This is making it difficult for dolphins to find food. Finally, human disturbance is also a problem. Human disturbance can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.

Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.<eos>"

When you sit in a studio audience, you feel like you are part of the show. You sit there, squashed among strangers, while someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh accordingly. It may be more exciting than watching television at home, but it's not always the best way to see the show.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly. If the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

There are different ideas about the best way to preserve the drawings. Some experts believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but to charge a fee or rope off the area.

The problem is that there is not enough money to pay for guards or to charge a fee. If the damage continues at this rate, the drawings will be lost forever.<eos>"

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They have a childhood game that is very popular. It's called pichenotte.

Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. The pucks are flicked across a board using the middle or index finger of one hand. If you flick a puck into a hole, you get 20 points. If you flick a puck into one of the three concentric rings around the hole, you get 15, 10 or 5 points, respectively. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses made a few more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money changed hands and the game's popularity grew. So much so that championships began to take place and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created.

The Lagasses are happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune. They're also selling their boards to others.<eos>"

Every week, newspapers in Britain publish pictures that can invade people's privacy. Sometimes, pictures of celebrities are taken without their consent. This can be very upsetting for people. But very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is an organization that can deal with issues of this kind. The pictures that are published in newspapers are often not in the public interest. They are usually pictures of celebrities or other people who are in the public eye. If a person is unhappy about a picture that is published in a newspaper, they can complain to the PCC. However, the PCC does not always launch an investigation. This is a scandal. The PCC should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. If the PCC decided to take on the role of 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry. And if the person involved still refused to do anything, the PCC might still proceed with the investigation.<eos>"

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you need to ask yourself what sort of job you want to look for. You should choose your second job very carefully and aim to stay in it for two to three years. It should be a job that extends you, develops you and gives you increasing responsibility. If you have the travel bug, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system and are not likely to go off again.<eos>"

Confident people have a secret. They have learned to be confident because they had to. Nina Hathway asked five people how they did it.

A Jenny said, ""When I left school, I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. But I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course.""

B Michaela said, ""It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. But I learned that to be confident, you've got to believe in yourself.""

C Lisa said, ""People think I'm very confident, but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV.""

D Barbara said, ""My confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work I do, but it's something that I've built up over the years.""

E Kim said, ""After I left college, I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing with what was being said, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I summoned up the confidence to start making my point.""<eos>"

What kind of shopper are you? Everyone goes shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers. Some people love shopping, while others dislike it. There are also people who are indifferent to shopping.

If you love shopping, you might be like Abby, who is an addict and can't spend enough money. If you dislike shopping, you might be like Brenda, who is reluctant and feels guilty when she spends money. If you're indifferent to shopping, you might be like Juliet, who only shops for essentials.

No matter what type of shopper you are, there are some things that everyone can agree on. Shopping can be tiring, and it's always better to buy less than you need.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grass. They live in every region on the earth. Grass can grow in the cold environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a lot of animal life. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals can live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass, a new meal is available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. There was a new line completed a few months before Mark's journey. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south.

The school is very well designed, so it holds all the heat and sound inside. If we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we're inside a concert hall.

Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a long time ago that people started to wear different shoes on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines made it easier to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of people. '<eos>"

I injured my back and had to take a break from running. I wanted to introduce more women to the sport and show them how much fun it can be. I started a running group for women in my area because I was not happy with the way race organizers treated women. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but also use this as an excuse for not providing separate changing facilities. I put up posters and many women joined. They were all attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general. I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress.<eos>"

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold found in Alaska. Many people came to the area to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the winter, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a track was built that would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead.<eos>"

My name is Katie and I am 14 years old. I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, our band won a jazz competition with bands from local high schools. Each band had their own costumes. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school. We often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time. I'm lucky because I have great teachers and parents who've supported me all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music.<eos>"

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city where it can rain between November and March. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, the streets become rivers. The local people welcome the rain because they have parks and gardens. The water comes from the mountains all year round thanks to a network of underground channels. These channels are called oases. Further south from Marrakesh, there is a place called Skoura. Here, the land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food.

The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you need to drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen. You should drive slowly and gently, like you would if you had a cup of hot coffee in your hand. If there is a lot of ice on the road, you need to look further down the road and allow extra space for stopping. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will avoid trouble.<eos>"

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but he still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists and painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings.

Aitchison says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' He changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them.<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are not very common because families are usually at home at that time. But winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. If you go on holiday, it is a good idea to leave lights on in your living room and bedroom.

Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone.

Howard Bonnier is a young Englishman who lives in a village called Bray, which is about fifty kilometres west of London. He has a restaurant called The Palace. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. Howard is only 29 years old. He likes to cook. When he was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He decided to open a restaurant because he loves cooking. It's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but Howard is sure he's done the right thing.<eos>"

Line dancing is a popular hobby in Britain. There are clubs and classes for line dancing in almost every town. It is easy to learn if you have two feet and can walk. You don't need a partner because you dance in groups. It's the best way to make new friends. In my classes, there are young and old people. The boys like it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet during the dances. Line dancing began about fifteen years ago when American country music became famous in Britain.<eos>"

In London a long time ago, there were no policemen. There were a few old men who used to protect the city streets at night. They were not paid very much. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, there was a group of people who stopped thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Later, there were more policemen in London. In 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We also build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. The engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.<eos>"
