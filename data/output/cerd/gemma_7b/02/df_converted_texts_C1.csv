Garbage collection is a ritual that is similar in many developed countries. In most places, it is free to dispose of rubbish. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish that is produced, people need to be charged for disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

When a town starts charging for rubbish disposal, the number of bags or cans that are collected usually decreases. However, this is often due to the 'Seattle stomp', which is when people cram more garbage into each container. This can be done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals.

In addition to the reduction in the number of bags or cans that are collected, there is also an increase in the weight of materials recycled. This is because people are more likely to recycle if they have to pay to dispose of their rubbish.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative and imaginative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, no amount of money or status will be able to compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.

There are a number of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you are passionate about. Another is to be able to work in a supportive and collaborative environment. If you are able to do both of these things, you will be much more likely to be successful in your career.

However, there are also a number of challenges that can make work difficult. One is stress. Another is the feeling of being unappreciated or undervalued. If you are experiencing these challenges, it is important to find ways to cope. There are many things that you can do to reduce stress and improve your overall well-being.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, which means that there are centralised resources intended for spreading and reproduction.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, it is striking that it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

In the early 1930s, there were attempts to experiment with other forms of organisation. But these attempts remained just that - attempts and experiments.

Television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s. And as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to want to have a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can be very persuasive, and it can make you feel like you need to buy things you don't have. To see how much you are influenced, I challenge you to not read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.

Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years, and there is a lot of research about them. Caves are also important because they have a long history of study.

Meteorology is the study of weather. Countless people have laid the foundations of meteorology, and it has progressed into a highly technical science.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily a theatre performance, but the music comes first. The music is the heart of opera. At a musical performance, there will usually be people who don't understand the technical or academic aspects of music. However, most people are impressed by the skill of the performers. Music and theatre audiences have different expectations. Theatre audiences expect to understand the nature of an actor's skill and be awed by the activity. Music audiences expect to be able to appreciate the beauty and skill of the performers. There are some things that could be done to change the conventions of music-going. For example, music audiences could be more patient and allow the performers to complete their performance without interrupting. They could also be more willing to try new and unfamiliar music.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film usually involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point.

The studio where I was working was a complex place. It was made up of many different buildings, and it was difficult to find your way around. But the studio lacked a focus. It would have been much better if there had been a single main entrance.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked. It was a lot of rules. But my mother was determined to teach me to follow them.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

One of the biggest problems is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system. Despite this, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. Some of the changes that are already happening include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in the timing of seasons, and changes in the distribution of plants and animals.

The future effects of climate change are predicted to be even more severe. Some of the predicted effects include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and changes to glacial processes.

The consequences of climate change are potentially devastating. They could include increased flooding and inundation, loss of homes and livelihoods, and mass displacement of people.<eos>"

Art is a powerful form of human expression that involves the creation and appreciation of aesthetic objects. These objects exist physically and are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they are housed. However, the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience. When artistic objects are separated from their original context and operation, they become isolated and difficult to understand. To understand the meaning of artistic products, we must forget them for a time and turn aside from them to have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts.<eos>"

The early 1990s were a tough time for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes, and the economy was in a bad state.

However, despite the challenges, the advertising industry continued to grow. Companies started to realize that they needed to make sure their advertising was effective. They wanted to get better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better media placement.

The recession also made it difficult to produce effective advertising. There was a lot of controversy over production costs, and people were reluctant to take risks. As a result, many advertising professionals had to revisit Lord Leverhulme's commonplace that only half of their advertising works.

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.<eos>"

The craft of acting can be seen as a derision or contempt by some people. This is often fueled by actors themselves when they are compelled to talk about their craft in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' Instead, they often fall into ponderous cliches, silly truisms, or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine.

What is acting? What is behaviour? Is the former an imitation or an evocation of the latter? That is the central question about the life of the theatre. One director's approach to rehearsal is known as 'dropping in'. This procedure goes something like this. The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking. When it is their turn to speak, they glance off the screen, digest the first phrase, think about what it means to them, wait to find the impulse - the reason to speak - then speak.

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the theatre itself creates a relationship between the performer and the audience.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world and distant parts of the solar system. It has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.

The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Photography has changed radically since its invention in 1839. It has moved into what might be termed 'mythic time' and has passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document.<eos>"

It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess.

Oral History

The trend of historians using oral evidence has its challenges. It is not always true that someone's testimony is a pure reflection of the past. In an interview, each person is affected by the other person. The historian chooses the informant and decides what to talk about. Even if the historian does not ask any questions and simply listens, the presence of an outsider changes the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. The end product is influenced by both the historian's social position and the terms in which he or she has learned to analyze the past. To be a good historian, you must accept responsibility for your part in creating new evidence.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to studying animals. The physiological approach focuses on how the body works. The whole animal approach studies the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it. Within the whole animal approach, there are two main types of study: psychology and ethology. Psychologists study learning abilities in a restricted range of species. Ethologists study naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap, the two approaches are distinct. To understand animal behaviour, you need to study it at both a physiological and a behavioural level.

The Social Sciences

Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance of the subject and the methodology. This means becoming familiar with the knowledge and research findings in the textbooks and the methods used to obtain and organize that knowledge. The two elements are closely related. Although common sense may seem to apply to social life, each social science discipline goes beyond common sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts. To understand social science, you need to learn the basic ideas in the subject.

Classical Architecture

Classical architecture was more than just the construction of buildings. It was an art form. Vitruvius, a Roman architect, said that architecture consists of order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. These concepts are based on earlier Greek authority. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was a long history of basic construction before the development of sophisticated architectural concepts. However, the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.<eos>"

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had mastered this new skill.

They decided to go on a journey together. They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. They left early in the morning and returned by midday. Lily drove impeccably. She overtook a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve. Chen went as far as applauding.

They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

The internet opened up a new way for people to share their opinions about books. A popular online bookstore called Amazon allowed anyone to write a review of a book. This made it easy for people to see what others thought of a book. The reviews on Amazon were free and uncensored, which meant that anyone could say what they wanted about a book. However, there were some problems with the reviews. For example, some people wrote fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people wrote reviews that were too long or too short. Despite these problems, the reviews on Amazon were still a valuable tool for readers. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

There is a new situation that I want to talk about. An artist chooses a piece of text and asks someone to write it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. But the problem is that the art-buying public often expects artists to stick to one genre. If an artist tries to do something new, they are often met with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side.<eos>"

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.

The house wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The overcrowded tube journey had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, and the smell of dinner from the kitchen.

The job was important to Lois and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.<eos>"

There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were royalty or wealthy. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast became more common. This is probably because there was more food available.

A map is used to show the relationships between points and features on the Earth's surface. It is determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of a map. The traveller's main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', so accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Early maps were often rivalled by written itineraries. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs, realistic or conventional, and varied in size to indicate their importance. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content. Today, cartography is used in many sciences, such as geology, history, and geography. It is also used to show distributions of various things, such as geological strata and climatic regimes.<eos>"

Language is a powerful tool that humans have. We can use language to communicate with each other and ourselves. It is such an instinctive skill that people know how to talk like spiders know how to spin webs. Climate and weather are also powerful forces that affect the lives of animals and plants. They can be a dominating force on the character of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are natural treasure troves. Cold, windswept areas can only muster a scattered selection of living things. The daily weather patterns that add up in the long term to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing. Some of the motion is due to the fact that the air rests on a spinning globe. A more important source of turbulence, or air movement, however, is the sun.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae.

They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one.<eos>"

The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. She writes other people's autobiographies and people enjoy doing it. The assurance of confidentiality encourages her subjects to overcome any instinct of self-censorship.

From here to paternity, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children. I have loved every minute of it. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond.

I have been a father for many years. I have made some mistakes, but I have always tried to be there for my children. If they need me, I'm here. I'm always on the basis that they ring me.

I also have a lot of other experiences as a father. I have been through a lot of things with my children, from their first concerts to their sports days. I'm sad that I missed some of those things, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. After that, the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump. After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.<eos>"

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have been looking after orphaned animals ever since. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet and their eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. They were cold and whimpering. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.

The cubs were fed every four hours and they progressed to drinking from a bottle and moving around within a week. However, tragedy struck when I noticed that Willow, one of the cubs, seemed lethargic. He died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken. But fate took a turn for the better when I found another male cub, Willow II. He joined the fold and was doing well.

The cubs grew and thrived, eating cereals, meat and vegetables, and fruit and nuts. They also started to dig for earthworms. As the weather got colder, the cubs began to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often went through the orchard and the cubs would chase each other's tails.

One evening, I spotted odder badgers in our field. They were climbing into our badger pen and I was worried about the cubs. I placed sheet metal over the gate to make it inaccessible. The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers and there was a huge response. We started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With the help of local firms and a bus company, we were able to build a sett and the badgers moved in.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley led a remarkable life. He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the positions of the stars, and also found time for other interests.

Dr. Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip. He will retrace the route of the Paramore and make measurements that Halley made. These measurements need to be updated because the terrestrial magnetic field is slowly but constantly changing. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest individuals are most likely to survive and reproduce. The peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance. Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes. Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many differences between humans and animals are not unique. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.

Human art is different from animal art because it is non-utilitarian, aesthetic pleasure-driven, and learned rather than instinctive. However, some similarities between human and ape art exist. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. They were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction.<eos>"

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks to re-establish himself in chess. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, but it has shown that he is not the same player he was in 1972. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played on a board, but much of modern chess is played off the board. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire.<eos>"

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

Volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and democratic participation. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative or self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organisations they work for, as well as provide space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience.

Volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development.<eos>"

When a hedgehog is attacked, it can roll into a tight ball, with its spines pointing outwards. This is a good defence mechanism, but it depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines than other hedgehogs, so they are more likely to try to run into their attacker. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night, and they sleep for much of the day. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so. In suitable conditions, some hedgehogs will stay awake all year round. '

The training camp has a simple schedule. The athletes wake up early and run, followed by interval training and a steady run in the late afternoon. They also have three meals a day and bathe in the streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.

By the time Richard left the camp, he was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. He realized that their success is not due to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone.

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has not been able to keep up with the pace of economic change. As brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are.

If you visit a supermarket, you will probably buy a few advertised brands, but not many. You will probably buy a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands.

Advertising is cost-effective, but it is also wasteful. The vast majority of advertising is wasted. The advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all.

So, if advertising is to get going again, its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before.<eos>"

The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Throughout the ages, iron has been a powerful force in human imagination. Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen who have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. They have also been recognized as artists. In the eighteenth century, blacksmiths produced beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral and other buildings. The sinuous metalwork of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was also the work of talented blacksmiths. However, the practice of blacksmithing had declined in Britain by the late 1960s. There has been a revival in recent years thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. The blacksmiths craft is being promoted through a series of events over the next few weeks. One of the events is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). The exhibition includes a wide range of pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at PS90 and climb well into four figures.<eos>"

The day I gave up smoking, I was pleased that everyone would be happy. But one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she yelled. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I guess my inability to explain how I had been a smoker for many years and how I had stopped four hours earlier was a little annoying. The stop-smoking session was a mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place two months and three weeks ago. I had not intended to stop and I did not particularly want to. But I did stop. The stop-smoking messages made sense. The physical craving for nicotine faded after a few days. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order. Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing. I am increasingly coming to the view that for me smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much.<eos>"

To photograph people effectively, you should follow these steps:

1. Group people in a way that is visually appealing.
2. Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
3. Avoid pretending to take a picture when it is clear that you are.
4. Make eye contact with your subject and ask them to look into the lens.
5. Use expressions and gestures to convey the subject's mood.
6. Consider the background and environment to add interest and information to the picture.

The media can earn money from content they don't own. Social media has made it easier to capture newsworthy events. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, there is ongoing debate about whether this is ethical. Research indicates that a significant number of people would film or photograph a news event, so UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. To maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must take steps to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.<eos>"

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most widely recognized in the West.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or ill.

To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles inserted into the skin at specific points on the meridians. They may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on the meridians.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including chronic long-term pain, back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine. It is also used during surgery to reduce pain.

It is important to note that acupuncture is not a substitute for medical treatment. If you are experiencing pain, you should consult with a doctor to discuss your treatment options.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.

Handwriting can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.

According to Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says, 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'<eos>"

Chewing gum is a popular fashion accessory in the United States. Americans chew a lot of gum, with an estimated 12 million sticks being chewed daily. Gum is made from a variety of ingredients, including pine resins, softeners, and flavourings. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree. American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees. Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree. Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew. Today, chewing gum is made mostly from synthetic ingredients. As the chewing gum market has grown, manufacturers have had to develop synthetic alternatives.<eos>"

Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent, the Seven Summits. My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I climbed the Seven Summits in the order I completed them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

I was in a snow cave below the summit when I started talking to my feet. The cold was getting into my feet and I remembered other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite. I spent the next two days reliving our time spent on the summit ridge.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is considered the most treacherous in the world. We spent a lot of time humping equipment and food up to the base. We followed a new route and climbed 'alpine style', with our equipment and food on our backs. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

We got lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes. Our situation became serious because water is scarce. We spent the third day on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. We decided to miss out on the glacier and go across the north ridges instead. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality. We all got to the top within 8 hours.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

We walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes. We reached the summit by 11 am.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

We stayed climbing for a day. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We reached the summit by 11 am. I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden. With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently.<eos>"

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. And then it happened - the reservoir overflowed. The river seemed wild and dangerous. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy the huge clouds that hang over the valley and be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses.<eos>"

Film critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. It was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lacking in self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but it didn't work out as planned. Mark chose film as his area of focus.

The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping.

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. She won the junior section - but then she was the only junior taking part. She was determined to do well and she worked very hard to achieve her goal. But she had a problem. She was cycling too far and she ended up running 20 kilometres too far. She cried all the way through the running. But she did not give up and is determined that she never will.

Melanie has tried other events. She has had a go at the triathlon 'sprint', for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon.<eos>"

The hobby of collecting is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm. Many people enjoy collecting things, and one in three adults indulges in this hobby. If you enter this world, remember one thing: if you do not fall in love with an object, do not collect it.

People have been collecting things since the beginning of time. Primitive man collected pebbles, and children still collect stones and seashells. You can also collect flowers, pottery, paintings, or even toys.

If you are interested in collecting, there are a few things you need to know. First, you need to find something that you are passionate about. Second, you need to be patient and persistent. Third, you need to be willing to learn from your mistakes.

Once you have found your passion, you can start collecting. You can start small, like I did, and build your collection over time. You can also start by collecting items that are inexpensive. As you become more experienced, you can start to collect more valuable items.<eos>"

No title. We always go to Ireland in June. Every year, the four of us have spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds bought the house and have added to it, but everything has been done discreetly.

We've been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland.

When we arrived at Glencorn Lodge, Mrs Malseed welcomed us and painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In the evening, we played cards and had dinner. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not for as long as we might because we were still quite tired after the journey.

In the morning, we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.<eos>"

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and other similar tasks. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and he will produce a report giving his observations and recommendations.

If you are considering changing your career, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of each option carefully. You should also consider your financial commitments and your personal goals. If you decide to go to a careers adviser, be prepared to provide a lot of personal information.<eos>"

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is a popular treat in many countries. It is made from cacao beans, which are seeds from the cacao tree. The cacao tree is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate.

Chocolate is often eaten at Easter and Christmas. People also eat chocolate when they have a special occasion. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities.

Today, chocolate is a popular treat in Britain. People eat about four bars of chocolate each week. Manufacturers are looking for new ways to attract customers. The latest marketing trick is the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert.<eos>"

The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read about pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. Since they started digging, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.

Now they are running short of money. They will have to convince a backer to put money into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies.

I was tired, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was glad to be home. I said exactly the same thing the following year and the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe.

The train trip was a valuable personal experience. It was a chance to escape the guided tour and do something different. I took great pride in the fact that I could see the view from the station in many places. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience.<eos>"

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you will have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage. It is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. The system for handling baggage at airports is complex. It involves check-in times, minimum connecting times (MCTs), and extra security checks. Sometimes, the system fails. If your luggage is lost, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR).<eos>"

To help a child who shows exceptional musical ability, there are a few options. If the child is very young, it may be best to wait until they are old enough to make their own decisions before considering a specialist music school. However, if you have the means and your child is younger than that, there are a few schools that offer specialized music education.

These schools provide a supportive environment where gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend a significant amount of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One is the cost, which can be high. However, each school will make every effort to help parents find the necessary fees. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a very early age.

If you are considering sending your child to a specialist music school, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully. If you have any concerns, you should talk to the school's director.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden. With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common types of dolphin. Bottlenoses are particularly social and live in large groups. They are often seen flashing quickly past ships.

The main threats to dolphins are pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance. Pollution can be stored in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Overfishing can also reduce the amount of food that dolphins have to eat. Human disturbance can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to find food or communicate.

Dolphins are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to control the population of other animals and they are also a source of food for many other creatures. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive.<eos>"

In their natural habitat, film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman are often away from their home comforts for months on end. They are searching for the perfect shot. Two of the hardest creatures to track down in East Africa are Amanda and Owen. Their present habitat, the Ngorongoro Crater, has been affected by a lot of rain.

The Netball Captain

Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. She is captain of the team and has been playing at a high level for many years. Recently, she had a typical day for the weeks leading up to the World Championships. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in the local supermarket car park.

Kendra is very focused on her training and doesn't notice much else while she is playing. She says, ""My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships."" The Championships are very important to her and she wants to win.

The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra points out that the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series,"" she says. ""And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.""

As captain, Kendra has a strong mental attitude and leads by example. She says, ""From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned."" So she took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned.<eos>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

The dive can last for 16 hours. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released. It's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two thirds of her salary comes from teaching. The only time she's been frightened is when she first went down with the Americans. There was an explosion and she thought, ""I'm going to die.""

It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the underwater volcanoes, there is such a sense of wonder.<eos>"

Mary Pearce was studying to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and was confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. However, she didn't get the job. The Head Teacher said that if someone doesn't take the time to present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?

It is important to have a professional image for an interview. You should dress appropriately, make good eye contact, and have a positive attitude. You should also be on time and not appear too desperate or too eager to please.

Finally, you should be well-prepared and communicate clearly. You should inform yourself about the company, have a few questions ready, and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences.<eos>"

When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.

Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.<eos>"

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. But to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of the contents. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother also always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. When I left home to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Sometimes my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it is the letters I remember most. I also have penfriends from all over the world. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 'lost art'.<eos>"

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged rapidly. The mountain is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged by people stamping on them, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs. To save the drawings, experts are divided over the best way. Some believe that the only way is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, while others think that a fee or ropes could be used to control the damage.

The main problem is financial. There is not enough money to hire enough guards to prevent people from damaging the drawings. If the damage continues at this rate, the drawings will not survive for future generations.<eos>"

Yet there is a demand for new faces and new talent. If you have the talent and the courage, you can become an actor. Acting is all about the moment of contact between the actor and the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. But they will take nothing for granted because they know that they are only as good as their current job.

Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. The pucks are flicked across a board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

The Lagasses have made a lot of money from selling their boards. They have sold more than 450 boards. They are made of birchwood and mahogany, and they weigh 12kg. They cost $595 each.

The village was built using a lot of soil and clay. Bulldozers and digging machines helped to change the land. Top soil was brought in to create the lawns, flower-beds and rockeries. Many trees and shrubs were planted in the village. They had to be carefully selected for the area.

The models in the village are made from a variety of materials. They are constructed from stone, concrete, wood and plastics. The models are very detailed and accurate. They have been built to withstand all kinds of weather.

The Model Village is a popular attraction. It is known for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used to construct the models have been used in other model villages around England.

Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, pictures of individuals in the public eye are taken without their consent and published on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The pictures are rarely in the public interest. They do not help to detect a crime or protect public health and safety. If the PCC decided to take on the role of 'police officer', there would be several problems. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry, and celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up. The role itself is too enormous and embarrassing. It is hard to see an easy solution to this serious problem.<eos>"

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

The young achiever Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion. She has won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her parents that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a loan and begin her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over PS500,000. Her clothes appear in fashion magazines, she designs for pop stars and she has just gained public recognition by winning this award. Her business has come a long way and she knows she is extremely lucky.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train travels across the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The climate can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. You need spikes for your boots because the snow is very hard. There was a lot of safety equipment, including lights, hats and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when they set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The track was steep and my legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, I had to rest more frequently. The others sometimes stopped for a break to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they set off again. I promised myself that in future I would always train properly before a climb. After a long climb, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. I was glad we had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

My new school is a very exciting place. It's made of wood, just like my old school, but it's also one of the first schools in my country that is designed to be really environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so I saw all of it happening. There are five classrooms, which are enormous. We share one room with people in the town when they want to have meetings. There's also a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. The school is well designed to hold all the heat and sound inside. If we sing inside our classrooms, it sounds like we're in a concert hall. The roof of the school has a tree on top of it. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday. It's so big, it can be seen for miles. We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it.

My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not very nice, but we had everything we needed. On Saturday morning, I met the other members of our group.

When I realized that I had done that, it was too late. I didn't know what to do. I was 72 years old and I was a long way from home. I was quite worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely. The telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it.

Sharks are scary creatures that live in the ocean. They have good eyesight and can feel movement through special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they don't sleep much. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can't move. This is a useful technique for researchers who often need to handle sharks. It allows them to learn more about these fascinating creatures.<eos>"

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, the guests were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as the first part of the hotel is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The finishing date depends on nature, so there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC. Guests need to wear warm clothes and socks. If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.<eos>"

There was also a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop.

Tanya Streeter is a world-record holder in free-diving. Free-diving is a sport where people reach great depths on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by being the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath. She had been deeper before, but this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man.

Tanya spends a lot of time training for her dives. She does a lot of land-based training at the gym, and she also spends time in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart, but she doesn't run because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness.

When Tanya is not training, she makes frequent public appearances. She has also supported environmental organisations. She is well-known in some countries, so people are prepared to listen to her when she is talking about environmental issues.<eos>"

But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. Not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults.

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the winter months, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat.

The Iditarod Trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. It was decided that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead. The trip covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey.<eos>"

Some people think that zoos are a good idea because they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals.

My name is Katie Atkins, and I'm 14 years old. I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools. Our band won! Each band had its own costumes. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch.

I have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. Only about half of the people who want to play get accepted. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language.

Jazz is a really exciting music. It's both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time.

My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who've supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music.<eos>"

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Although it doesn't happen often, when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods. As many winters have been dry in recent times, the rain is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels that bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels, dug in the 11th century, are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, the land is divided into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.<eos>"

Welcome to the website of Antarctica Sightseeing Flights. Here is all you need to know before booking a flight. We offer full-size passenger plane flights from Sydney, Australia, over the continent of Antarctica. Flight dates for next year are not yet definite, but if you make a booking now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the day.

The flight usually lasts for 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, you will usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, our guides give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. You can also see a pilot's eye view of the flight from the camera next to the pilot.

While over Antarctica, we encourage you to get up from your seat and move about the plane. We fly in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow everyone to see the amazing sights equally well from both sides of the plane.

We do not land on Antarctica primarily for environmental reasons. To experience Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour. You can take photographs with all your cameras. We even provide a few fun onboard photo opportunities where you can experience what it is like to wear Antarctic cold weather clothes.<eos>"

For a group of children between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are a time to learn the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are popular, with a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay a fee of PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her.' Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Winter driving is dangerous because it is difficult to predict what will happen and accidents happen easily. The weather can be bad and the road can be icy. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road. To drive safely on icy roads, you should drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen. You should also allow extra space for stopping. If you are driving too fast, you may not be able to stop in time. So, it is important to stay in control of your car at all times.<eos>"

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but he still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. He painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' He changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them.<eos>"

Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their instruments. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their singing. Although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. They play regularly in local clubs for young people.

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It is a very good college that gives young people the opportunity to learn and gain experience outside the classroom. The students, who are between 16 and 18 years old, come from all over the world. They spend their mornings studying and their afternoons doing activities like helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the best things about Atlantic College is that it has students from many different countries. As few can afford the fees, grants are available. Many students are British and they receive government help. ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like."" To sum up, Atlantic College is a very good college that gives its students an excellent education.<eos>"

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she climbed the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. Life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink. When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.<eos>"

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. They live in Canada. When the weather gets cold in Canada, the birds have to fly south where the weather is warmer. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was hot weather and people didn't want to buy sweaters. So, she made some socks. Everybody loved the socks because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started.

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also ask your neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when you are away. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

In the past, people used to go to the forest to find food. They had to move around a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and their villages grew bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years.

John, who uses the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, is not going to stop working in the park in England. He does not know yet how much he will earn from his music. 'I must keep my job in the park,' he says. 'I still have to pay my bills!' The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan. They've never even heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, a hospital worker, says, 'This will not change the way we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!''<eos>"

Simplified text: 'Line dancing is a popular hobby in Britain. Many people enjoy line dancing in their towns. It is easy to learn if you have two feet and can walk. You don't need a partner because you dance in groups. It's a great way to make new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. The boys like it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet during the dances. Line dancing began about fifteen years ago when American country music became famous in Britain.<eos>"

There are five different types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The other rhinos live in forests in Asia. Rhinos have big, heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The rhino's big body stands on four short legs. Each foot has three toes. Rhinos usually walk very slowly, but they can run at 50 kilometres an hour. Rhinos are usually quiet and calm animals, and they only eat grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos when it is born. It has been inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and may live to be 50 years old.<eos>"

In London in the 18th century, there were no policemen. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night. About 300 years ago, London was growing bigger and dirtier. There were a lot of thieves who stole money in the streets. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Later, London became even bigger and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are well paid.<eos>"

Every year, thousands of people visit Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, to take part in the Edinburgh Festival. The festival lasts for three weeks every August and September. During this time, the streets of the city are filled with music and dance. You can even see artists painting pictures on the streets. One of the best parts of the festival is the 'Fringe', where students do comedy shows. Tens of thousands of tourists come to the festival to see new films and plays and hear music played by famous musicians. This year, you can see over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. The tickets for these performances are quite cheap. It is usually easier to see your favourite star in Edinburgh than it is in London. So come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be difficult to find a room, so why not book your hotel now?<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

Madame Tussaud's museum is a popular place for tourists in London. People can see figures of famous people made of wax. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, a doctor, made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. Marie helped him in his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. Here she had to copy the heads of famous people when they were dead, including Queen Marie Antoinette's. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud and in 1802 she came to London with her wax figures. Here she opened a museum and her figures can still be seen today.<eos>"

The bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. It was invented about one hundred and fifty years ago. In the past, bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could afford to buy one. The early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought one. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles. But some people still prefer to cycle to work. They say that there are too many cars in town centres and you can't find anywhere to park.<eos>"

Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family for a beach holiday. We went to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.<eos>"

There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. They can be up to 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot. Lions are the only cats that stay together in large family groups. Several lions may work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. All cats need good eyes, because they catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast, and very strong.<eos>"

Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour. It is very difficult for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water. '

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. ""Well, in the winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We asked her what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!""<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are different ways to climb Kilimanjaro. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Not everyone who tries to climb Kilimanjaro reaches the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero.

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. Otters can close their ears and nose. This means they can stay under water for several minutes. In the past, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for them. But today, there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.<eos>"

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We also build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.<eos>"

But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail.
