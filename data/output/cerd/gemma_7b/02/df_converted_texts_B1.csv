Garbage collection is a ritual that is similar in many developed countries. In most places, it is free to dispose of rubbish. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish that is produced, people need to be charged for disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.

When a town starts charging for rubbish disposal, the number of bags or cans that are collected usually decreases. However, this is often due to the 'Seattle stomp', which is when people cram more garbage into each container. This can be done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals.

In addition to the reduction in the number of bags or cans that are collected, there is also an increase in the weight of materials recycled. This is because people are more likely to recycle if they have to pay to dispose of their rubbish.<eos>"

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to enjoy your work, even if you have a high salary or a lot of status.

There are a number of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you are passionate about. Another is to be able to have a conversation with your boss and colleagues. If you are able to do these things, you will be more likely to be successful in your career.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

Television is related to other two-way forms of communication. It was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern societies.

In the early 1930s, there were two little-known, distinct alternatives to the way television was organised. One was experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone. The other was various popular science journals that had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers.

But Big Business saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets and centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of things doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can play on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you will be a lesser human being. There is a lot of advertising everywhere. It can be on TV, the radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, and the internet. It can also be on clothes and other things. All of this advertising can make you want to buy things. Caves are interesting places. They are part of the natural environment and they can be very mysterious. People have studied caves for a long time. However, exploring caves can be physically demanding.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. The music is the most important part of an opera. At a musical performance, there will usually be people who don't understand the music. But they are still impressed by the skill of the performers. Theatre audiences have different expectations than concert hall audiences. They don't understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. However, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere. Music and theatre can both be very enjoyable art forms. They can bring people together and make them feel happy.<eos>"

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked on someone's front path. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other memories, like faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, and snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was quite the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked. It was as if a giant paperweight, composed of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her cronies, the obligation to 'behave proper', lay across my shoulders, and that it was my duty immediately to grow up and start the work of prising it free.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

One of the biggest problems is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system. Despite this, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. For example, the average annual global surface temperature has increased by between 1C and 3.5C since 1900. The average sea level around the world has also risen by 15-95 cm. And changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation are occurring.

Climate change is also having a negative impact on glaciers. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, which is causing a number of problems, including changes in vegetation, wildlife habitats, and sea levels.

The rise in sea levels is one of the most dramatic and visible effects of global warming. It is causing a lot of problems for people living in coastal zones, including increased flooding and inundation.<eos>"

Art is a powerful form of expression that can bring joy and understanding to people. However, sometimes the complexity of art can make it difficult for people to enjoy and understand. When art is separated from its connection to human experience, it becomes isolated and difficult to relate to. To understand art, we need to forget it for a time and turn aside from it. Instead, we need to focus on the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. This means arriving at the theory of art by means of a detour. Once we have done this, we can appreciate art in its raw, unrefined form.<eos>"

The consequences have been that marketing activities have at last begun to be given the attention they deserve by management, and that a few brands have actually begun to be genuinely marketed.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about.<eos>"

Despite these challenges, music continues to play an important role in our society. It provides opportunities for numerous activities, both formal and informal. Music is also beneficial to our well-being. Studies have shown that playing an instrument can improve cognitive skills, social relationships and concentration.

The craft of acting can be seen as a form of expression that involves both physical and psychological elements. Actors often find themselves being criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to convey emotions effectively. However, there are some actors who are able to overcome these challenges and deliver powerful and memorable performances.

One such actor is Adrian Lester, who is known for his expressive and nuanced portrayal of the character Hamlet. Lester's ability to convey emotion through his body and voice is truly captivating. He is able to bring the character of Hamlet to life in a way that is both relatable and moving.

Another important aspect of acting is the relationship between the actor and the audience. The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the audience is close enough to the actor to hear, see, and feel what is going on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are also important.

The Romans believed that architecture should be in harmony with nature and that it should be used to express beauty and emotion. The origins of classical architecture are complex. However, the basic idea of the classical temple is simple. It is a single-roomed hut.<eos>"

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had learned to drive. They made plans to go on a journey. They decided to leave early in the morning and return by midday. Lily drove impeccably. She overtook a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve. They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was concerned about the road markings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away. The girls were upset. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances. Chen took Man Kee to the eyepiece and showed him the ship. He promised to take Man Kee home when he was finished. The ship was gone. Chen was sad. He put a coin in the slot and trained the glass on the ship. He found the ship. Man Kee was happy. He would not be parted from the telescope.<eos>"

The internet opened up a new way for people to share their opinions about books. A popular online bookstore called Amazon allowed anyone to write a review of a book. This made it easy for people to see what other readers thought of a book. The reviews on Amazon were free and uncensored, which meant that people could say whatever they wanted about a book. However, there were some problems with the reviews. For example, some people wrote fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people wrote reviews that were too long or too short. Despite these problems, the reviews on Amazon were still a valuable tool for readers. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying.<eos>"

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. But today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

Today, artists are left to their own devices and we get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds. If an artist chooses a piece of text and writes it on a canvas, is the finished product a painting?

The artist's new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground. The sketches have provided the material for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings which convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.<eos>"

Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose.

The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The students were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel. There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places. The flight was smooth and the students were excited. They floated aimlessly and danced in the air. It was an unforgettable experience for all of the students.<eos>"

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have been looking after orphaned animals ever since. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs. Their coats were like velvet and their eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. They were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth.

The cubs grew quickly and started to eat from a bottle. After a few days, they were feeding every four hours. Within a week, they had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented.

However, fate took a turn for the worse. One of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic and died. I was heartbroken. But fate worked in strange ways. Six days later, I found another male cub, Willow II, who had been abandoned by his mother. I took him in and he joined the fold.

The cubs grew and thrived. They were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. They were very active and would go for walks at dusk or late at night.

One day, I spotted some odder badgers in our field. They were probably looking for food. We were warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so I placed sheet metal over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.

We started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With the help of local firms and a bus company, we were able to raise enough money to build the sett. The badgers moved into their new home and are doing well.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was used by sailors for many years.

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's voyage. He wants to commemorate Halley's accomplishments and also collect scientific data. The expedition will involve making measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, and most alert. But the peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length.<eos>"

The best boat design combines old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He designed his own boat, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has a lot of new technology, but it also has some traditional features. My own boat is different. It is a small boat that is designed for sailing in the sea. It is old-fashioned, but it is also very comfortable. The boat has a coal stove for warmth and dryness, and cosy berths for sleeping. It is not a luxurious boat, but it is a good boat for sailing. The problem with old-fashioned boats is that they need a lot of looking after. If you have a bad injury, you might need to sell your boat. If you are looking for a new boat, you should consider a boat that is designed for sailing, not for luxury.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.

Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities exist between humans and animals. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. Monkeys also have a simple one-word language.

As for art, the earliest forms of human art may have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.

There are some differences between human art and animal activities. Human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. But these differences don't seem to be fatal. Even some human art that later became famous was created by artists for their private satisfaction.<eos>"

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very large and dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed it and wrote about his adventure. There are not many big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be full of them. Now you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life.

Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The team was composed of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels and six camel handlers. The expedition was difficult because the camels had never worked with camels before and the desert was very harsh.

But Blackmore managed to complete his expedition and he feels proud of his achievement. He also feels grateful for his family and the happiness they share.<eos>"

Most of us have a desire to be accepted, so we tend to conform to the norms of our society. But we also have a desire to be ourselves, so we sometimes resist conformity.

Book reviews play an important role in the success of books. Publishers and authors have different perspectives on reviews. Publishers rely on reviews to attract readers and generate sales. They often prefer positive reviews, as they believe that they can increase sales. Authors, on the other hand, are devastated by no reviews. They need reviews to promote their books and build their reputations.

However, book reviews can also have a negative impact on sales. If a book receives negative reviews, it can damage its reputation and make it less likely to be purchased. Despite the challenges, publishers need to continue to rely on book reviews to reach their target audience.<eos>"

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he tries to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played on a board, but much of modern chess is played off the board. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire.<eos>"

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

Volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and democratic participation. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.

At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative or self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organisations they work for, as well as provide space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience.

Volunteer tourism can also be seen as a way to help others. However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of volunteer tourism, such as the bypassing of democratic processes and the reduction of development to individual acts of charity.<eos>"

The clock radio is a common device used to wake people up. To choose a good clock radio, you need to consider several factors. The 'dual alarm function' does not allow you to snooze or be driven out of bed. Instead, it allows you to set two different wake-up times. The inclusion of a cassette player is a great feature, allowing you to fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up to a day without news. The quality of the radio is excellent, but the size is a bit big. The clock has a self-power back-up and a wide snooze bar. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing.

When a hedgehog is attacked, it can roll into a tight ball, with its spines pointing outwards. This is a good defence mechanism, but it depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines than other hedgehogs, so they are more likely to try to run into their attacker. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night, and they sleep for much of the day. They hibernate in the winter, but not all hedgehogs do this. In suitable conditions, some hedgehogs will stay awake all year round. '

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has not been able to keep up with the pace of economic change. As a result, most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised.

When you're watching TV, you probably see a lot of commercials for brands you don't buy. Most people only register a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest. This is called waste.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved that it is. Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all.

So, if you are an advertiser, you need to make sure your advertising campaign is tightly targeted. If you can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population), you will be doing well.<eos>"

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda.

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. But in 1920, he thought he was seeing scientific proof that fairies really existed. He published photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images. It is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence.

Cindy, a teacher, swapped lives with Rosemary, who runs a dairy farm. Cindy had a lonely day. She spent most of the morning milking cows and inspecting sheep. It was exhausting and irregular, but she enjoyed it.

Overall, the text has been simplified by removing unnecessary details and repetitions, using simpler vocabulary and sentence structure, and breaking up the text into shorter paragraphs.<eos>"

I'm 34 years old and I'm nervous about backpacking. I've done it before, but I've been busy with my job and relationship. I decided to quit my job and rent out my flat to go travelling in South East Asia for a year.

There are a lot of reasons why people are travelling in their late twenties and thirties. Some people want to disentangle themselves from their lives and head off to foreign climes. Others want to have a final fling before settling down. And still others want to get rid of their old approach to life and start over.

There are also a number of factors that make it easier to travel in your late twenties and thirties. There's a much more flexible workforce today, and there are more people working on short-term contracts. Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies.

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you have to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to be aware of the camera's effect on these.

To photograph people effectively, you should follow these steps:

1. Group people in a way that is visually appealing.
2. Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
3. Avoid making it seem like you are taking a picture when you are not.
4. Make eye contact with your subject and ask them to look into the lens.
5. Use expressions and gestures to convey the subject's mood.
6. Consider the background and environment to add interest and information to the picture.
7. Include interaction between people in the picture.
8. Take pictures of people in their natural environment.
9. Decide whether you want to pose or not pose your subject.<eos>"

Research shows that a lot of people film or photograph news events. This means that UGC has a big part to play in the future of the media.

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most popular.

Acupuncture points are located along meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.

To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin at specific points on the meridians. They may also use warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on the meridians.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.

If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you.<eos>"

James worked full-time in administration for the National Health Service and made good use of her organizational skills. She also became 'quite accustomed' to seeing corpses while working in forensic science. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. It was the shape and construction involved in writing a crime novel that appealed to her.

James believes that writing detective stories is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life, even if that life is unlovable.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.

Handwriting can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.

A professional graphologist, Patricia Marne, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'<eos>"

Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree. Today, chewing gum is mostly made synthetically.

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks the plants and takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

My first job as a writer was writing articles about films for The Front Page newspaper. Before that, I had done some reviewing of novels and films. I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me.

If you are unhappy with your job, you can turn to a careers adviser. They will ask you to write a brief history of yourself and then conduct a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. Based on the results of the tests, the adviser will suggest various careers and the retraining needed.

Taking the careers test was like being back in your science exams. It involves picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers, matching up similar shapes in a set, and answering questions against the clock. After the test, you will have a long chat with the adviser and he will produce a report giving his observations and recommendations.

If you are considering changing your career, you should definitely visit a careers adviser. They can help you to identify your skills and interests and suggest a new career that is more suited to you.<eos>"

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a comfortable blue couch. Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist. To make people feel more relaxed, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. He has a lot of relaxation techniques, such as virtual-reality headsets and a pleasant smell in the surgery. He also uses a special instrument that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. He found out that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.<eos>"

Chocolate, which is made in South America, is popular worldwide. People in Britain spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter and Christmas. The cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztecs, Toltecs and Mayans over three thousand years ago. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate. The chocolate drink was first made in Aztec times and was used on ceremonial occasions and for welcoming visitors. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities. Until the last century, chocolate was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, a Dutch inventor named CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847. Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week.<eos>"

Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, travelled from Canada to Africa to find gold. They have a mine on the side of a Welsh mountain that could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they are convinced that they are close to a five million dollar vein of gold.

The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read about pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. Since they started their work, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. Now they are running short of money and need to convince a backer to put money into the project.

The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens.<eos>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

The dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to gather samples, and then three hours to get back up to the surface. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released.

Last year, Rachel dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes.

I was tired, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year and the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe.

The train trip was a valuable personal experience. It was a chance to escape the guided tour and do something different. I took great pride in the fact that I could see the view from the station in many places. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience.<eos>"

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you will have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage, even the best ones. It is impossible to guarantee that your luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when there is a change of aircraft. To make sure your luggage arrives safely, you should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If a change of plane is unavoidable, try to fly the same airline throughout and allow more connecting time. If your luggage is lost, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.<eos>"

The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It feeds on fish. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast. It has a powerful image that lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He has a deep feeling for this little bird. He can't identify just what it is that draws him to it. The kingfisher is the stuff of legend. There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue. The kingfisher is a popular bird to photograph. It is easy to watch from a hideout. You can see a kingfisher in a woodland stream. If you are interested in photography, you might like to photograph kingfishers.<eos>"

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not able to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a lot of musical ability, they may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.

There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.

There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find the necessary fees. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. Finally, it can be stressful to be a musically gifted child. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks the plants and takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common kinds of dolphin. Bottlenoses are social creatures that live in groups. They are often seen in river mouths and coastal waters.

One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are caught in fishermen's nets, they may not be able to find food or they may be injured. Human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and oil wells can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.

Chris Greener was tall when he was young. He is the tallest man in Britain. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Today, most people eat a diet that is based on three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet has had a negative impact on human health. However, there is a positive trend. The average man in the US, Holland, and Japan is now taller than he was in the past. This is due to improved nutrition. However, there are also some problems. For example, leg-room in planes and trains has shrunk. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some programmed upper limit.<eos>"

Studio audiences are a common feature of television life. They are made up of people from all classes, professions and income groups. People often go to studio audiences to appear on television, take a look behind the scenes, or simply have fun.

When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.

Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.<eos>"

Bruce likes landscapes that have a human element. He finds it important to have people in the landscape. When he travels abroad, he likes to visit lovely villages with old temples. He also likes to explore the countryside. He finds the landscape familiar yet different from his home in Scotland. He used to describe his adventures in his private diary. That was his first attempt at travel writing.

Sophia loves a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. She always travels first class. The scenery is not spectacular. But there is one point on the journey that she always looks forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. She sees herself in the eyes of the people who live in the houses.

Matthew likes the Hartland Peninsula. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks. He prefers to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys.

Annette's favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and she likes the feeling of space.

James purchased Glenthorne, his favourite house in Britain. It was a question of obtaining pure peace and reconnecting with his English roots. He grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve went to school in Devon, in the west of England. He used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. He finds Glenthorne to be a magical, secluded, romantic house.<eos>"

We love animals. One day, my daughter found a pine snake. We decided to keep it overnight. I was late getting home and when I arrived, there was a crisis. Domino the cat and Bianca the mouse were running around the bedroom. I tried to help, but I tripped over something and fell on the floor. The snake escaped and I was scared. I crouched like a rabbit and the snake was hissing and striking at me. I managed to capture Domino and pull the mouse from its jaws. I looked the snake over for weak points, but it didn't have any. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer and the snake relaxed. I eventually released the snake and it went away.<eos>"

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. But to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and the enjoyment of the contents.

I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mom when I was young. My mom always insisted that I write my own thank-you letters. When I left home to train as a doctor, I would write once a week. My parents and I wrote letters to each other regularly. I also wrote letters to my boyfriends. It was a way to stay in touch.

I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. I also appreciate notes, but I like to have a lot of news. It's better to have a year's supply of news than a few notes. I have penfriends in different countries. I have a penfriend in France, Australia, and Vancouver. I also have a penfriend in Texas.

I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition of letter writing. Like my mom before me, I insist that they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter and son have penfriends of their own. I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 'lost art'.<eos>"

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site but charge a fee.

The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there. If we do not take steps, the drawings will be lost for future generations.<eos>"

But it's a personal choice and only you can take responsibility for yourself. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You need talent and luck. There is a demand for new faces and new talent. Acting is all about making contact with the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted.

Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often include celebrities and other people who are in the public eye. Sometimes, these pictures are very private and can be very hurtful to the people who are pictured. However, very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is an organization that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The PCC has not launched an investigation into any of the recent stories about celebrities' privacy. This is a scandal. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. It would be a good idea to have the PCC take on this role of 'police officer'. However, there are some problems with this idea. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry.

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every place on the earth. Grasslands support a lot of animal life, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass, a new meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train travels across the Australian continent. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. The railway was originally built to carry goods. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train would save time and money. From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.<eos>"

It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. You need spikes for your boots on Ben Nevis because the snow is very hard. There was a lot of safety equipment, including lights, hats and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when they set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The track was steep and the legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, Keith had to rest more frequently. After a long climb, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye. However, they weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly.

Last month, I was hanging 30 meters above the ground. It was a lot of fun. I looked down at the river below me and I understood why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was not very nice, but we had everything we needed. On Saturday morning, I met the other members of our group. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing. We changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was difficult, but after a lot of pushing, we were out at last. We were covered in mud, but we were pleased and excited by what we'd done.<eos>"

On Saturday afternoon, I was on the bus and I left my handbag. It had my cheque book, address book, and my purse with about fifty pounds in cash and some credit cards. When I realized that I had done that, it was too late. I didn't know what to do. I was 72 years old and I was a long way from home. I was quite worried. I stood by the side of the road and just cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would just like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.<eos>"

Sharks are scary creatures that live in the ocean. They can see very well and they can also feel movement. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, sharks need to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.<eos>"

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in the winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. They were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous. Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. As soon as winter begins, the first part of the hotel is completed and it opens to visitors. The other parts of the hotel are completed in the following weeks. The hotel melts in the spring. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC. Guests need to wear warm clothes and socks. If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website.

Last Thursday, a new furniture shop called Homestyle opened. Many people went to the shop to buy furniture. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa and a bed. The shop was very busy and had to be closed soon after it opened. The people outside the shop became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. There was also a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk to the shop.

In the winter months, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail.

Nowadays, there is a dog sled race held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.<eos>"

My name is Katie Atkins, and I'm 14 years old. I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools. Our band won! Each band had their own costumes. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch.

I have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. Only about half of the people who want to play get accepted. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language.

Jazz is a really exciting music. It's both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time.

My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who've supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music.<eos>"

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but he still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. He painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' He changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them.<eos>"

I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in my job. I was jealous of the students at the university, who looked happy and carefree. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. But I am glad that I have this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying.<eos>"

Simplified Text: Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he began working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After he had driven it a long way, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model T. It was a cheap car. He was soon selling a lot of cars. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.<eos>"

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she climbed the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. Life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink. When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.<eos>"

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. In the fall, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are very cold in Canada, and the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found some young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the fall.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in the fall, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has a lot of sheep and each one has enough wool for many sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was hot and people didn't want to buy sweaters. So, she made some socks. Everybody loved the socks because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had a lot of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are many different socks for different people. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present.<eos>"

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also ask your neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when you are away. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

In the past, people used to go to the forest to find food. They had to move around a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and their villages grew bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a lot higher than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.<eos>"

Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack.

Dear Joan,

Thanks for your letter. I received it this morning. Yes, I'd like to see you. Would you like to meet me outside my office at one o'clock? There's a good Italian restaurant near there. Do you like Italian food? I have to be back at work by two o'clock, so please don't be late.

Yours,
Mary<eos>"

Dear Lorna,

I'm writing to you to tell you about my new job. Last month, I got a new job in the city centre. I'm working in a Tourist Information Office and it's very interesting. I start work every morning at half past seven, so I have to get up very early. I love this job because I meet people from all over the world. I like telling them about our city.

I've attached a photo of me wearing my new uniform. Do you like it?

Love,
Gloria<eos>"

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. It can be more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in Africa. There are not very many of them left. Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour. It is very difficult for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.<eos>"

Victoria, a student from Britain, started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her recently at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked her why she started the sport.

""I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.""

We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. ""Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We asked her what is important when you're learning. ""You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!""<eos>"

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a young boy to an old man. There are different ways to climb Kilimanjaro. People think that the Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is popular with tourists. Not everyone who tries to climb Kilimanjaro gets to the top. This is because the weather can change quickly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet, but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below zero. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes.<eos>"

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers. They can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. Otters can close their ears and nose. This means they can stay under water for several minutes. In the past, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for the otters. But today, there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.<eos>"

Dear David,

I'm going to visit your country next month with two friends. We haven't decided where to stay yet. Can you help us find a place to stay?

I have spoken to my aunt Gloria about you and she has offered to let us stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house. That would be perfect for us, wouldn't it?

David, I'm hoping you can help us. We would really appreciate it.

Sincerely,

People have always built buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We also build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.<eos>"

The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. There are a lot of green hills and fields between the two towns. On one of the hills, there is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to him is called Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think that it was a long time ago. To get closer to the picture, you can walk from Cerne. If you go on the first of May when the sun comes up, you will see all the people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.<eos>"

Gail Rollins is a runner from Edinburgh. She is one of the best runners in the city. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 meters and the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for coming second in big competitions. But she always smiled and laughed, and people in her home city loved her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch up. Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays.<eos>"

Postcards are a popular way to send messages to friends and family. They often have pictures of beautiful places on them. You can write a message on the back of a postcard. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.<eos>"

The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were many different kinds. Some were small, but others were giants. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was very long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also, it could run fast because it had long back legs.<eos>"

The bear is a dangerous animal. It is very strong and can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and running very fast. But they cannot see well. Like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are different kinds of bear. The largest is the white polar bear. There are two kinds of black bear. One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown.

The Globe Theatre was a very different place to visit 400 years ago. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. You can still visit the Globe Theatre today. There is a new theatre there where you can enjoy a Shakespeare play or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.<eos>"

Dear Jeff,

I'm having a good holiday in Australia. The weather was bad and cold when we arrived two weeks ago, but now it's better and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, so I loved swimming there. The fish were different there: red, yellow, and purple. Australia is a beautiful country. We don't want to come home. See you at the end of September. Sue<eos>"
