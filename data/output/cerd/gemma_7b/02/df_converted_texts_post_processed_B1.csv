Garbage collection is a ritual that is similar in many developed countries. In most places, it is free to dispose of rubbish. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish that is produced, people need to be charged for disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
When a town starts charging for rubbish disposal, the number of bags or cans that are collected usually decreases. However, this is often due to the 'Seattle stomp', which is when people cram more garbage into each container. This can be done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals.
In addition to the reduction in the number of bags or cans that are collected, there is also an increase in the weight of materials recycled. This is because people are more likely to recycle if they have to pay to dispose of their rubbish."

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, you will not be able to enjoy your work, even if you have a high salary or a lot of status.
There are a number of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you are passionate about. Another is to be able to have a conversation with your boss and colleagues. If you are able to do these things, you will be more likely to be successful in your career."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.
Television is related to other two-way forms of communication. It was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern societies.
In the early 1930s, there were two little-known, distinct alternatives to the way television was organised. One was experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone. The other was various popular science journals that had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers.
But Big Business saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets and centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of things doesn't make you feel secure. It's okay to have a home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can play on our insecurities. If you don't have one of these things, you will be a lesser human being. There is a lot of advertising everywhere. It can be on TV, the radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, and the internet. It can also be on clothes and other things. All of this advertising can make you want to buy things. Caves are interesting places. They are part of the natural environment and they can be very mysterious. People have studied caves for a long time. However, exploring caves can be physically demanding. It requires a lot of agility. This means that cave research has been less in the hands of scientists than other scientific fields. Meteorology is the study of the weather. People have been studying the weather for a long time. Satellites and electronic instruments can give us a lot of information about the weather.

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is mostly theatre, but the music comes first. The music is the most important part of an opera. At a musical performance, there will usually be people who don't understand the music. But they are still impressed by the skill of the performers. Theatre audiences have different expectations than concert hall audiences. They don't understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. However, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere. Music and theatre can both be very enjoyable art forms. They can bring people together and make them feel happy."

Sand is a nuisance when it is in its natural state. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you. When you are wet, it adheres to you like 'stucco'. But, when you are dry, it pours off you. Sand can stay with you for a long time. No, you can keep sand away.
A lock and key are used to keep people out of a place. They have been used for a long time. People like locks and keys because they make them feel safe. Some new locking systems use computer cards to control locks. But people don't like them. They prefer to use a physical key.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I noticed that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point.
The studio where I was working was a big place. It was made up of many different buildings. It was difficult to find your way around the studio. There was no clear main entrance. And there was nowhere to ask for directions.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked on someone's front path. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other memories, like faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, and snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was quite the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked. It was as if a giant paperweight, composed of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her cronies, the obligation to 'behave proper', lay across my shoulders, and that it was my duty immediately to grow up and start the work of prising it free."

I live on Philadelphia Avenue. It is a busy street. There are many houses and stores. I know this side of the street well. I have lived there for many years.
The houses on my street are different. Each one is unique. They are like the little troughs in the cement that lead water away from the roof gutters. They are all different shapes and sizes.
As I walk down the street, I see the changes that have happened over the years. The porches are lower and the front yards are smaller. The houses have changed a lot. They have been turned into stores. But some of the stores have also been turned back into homes.
I also see the changes in the people who live on my street. They have become older and their children have grown up. But they are still friendly.

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness."

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
One of the biggest problems is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system. Despite this, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.
The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. For example, the average annual global surface temperature has increased by between 1C and 3.5C since 1900. The average sea level around the world has also risen by 15-95 cm. And changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation are occurring.
Climate change is also having a negative impact on glaciers. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, which is causing a number of problems, including changes in vegetation, wildlife habitats, and sea levels.
The rise in sea levels is one of the most dramatic and visible effects of global warming. It is causing a lot of problems for people living in coastal zones, including increased flooding and inundation."

Art is a powerful form of expression that can bring joy and understanding to people. However, sometimes the complexity of art can make it difficult for people to enjoy and understand. When art is separated from its connection to human experience, it becomes isolated and difficult to relate to. To understand art, we need to forget it for a time and turn aside from it. Instead, we need to focus on the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. This means arriving at the theory of art by means of a detour. Once we have done this, we can appreciate art in its raw, unrefined form."

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s were probably the toughest of your professional life. There was a recession in business that was bad enough. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. In Britain, it meant that a lot of people lost their jobs and homes. Every single business in the country was affected. Advertising people are often under pressure because they are seen as the ones who are spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also have to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.
However, there has also been a rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The notion that companies should be making sure they are producing services and goods that their customers want, as opposed to merely what it is convenient for them to provide, is not new. And, it's not unfair to say that many companies have only recently begun to put this idea into practice. The consequences have been that marketing activities have at last begun to be given the attention they deserve by management, and that a few brands have actually begun to be genuinely marketed."

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. It was an unusual choice, but I was unhappy at university and I thought being a chef would be the perfect antidote to my problems. I started to learn how to cook by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens and preparing extravagant meals.
One day, I was eating at a famous restaurant in London. It was a revelation. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards. After that, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world.

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about."

Fashion is a long-standing tradition that has been influenced by the development of society and technology. As societies have grown more complex, people have started to wear more elaborate clothing and accessories. The meaning of dress has also become more complex and significant. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people. Some writers earn money by writing articles or books, while others write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs. The novel gets written thanks to the generosity of others and the hard work of writers. In the past, there was a time when we were performing at small venues and people were going wild.

Music has become an integral part of our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a significant increase in the opportunities to listen to music through various technologies such as radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and the internet. However, there has also been a decline in the performance of live music and the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. Despite these challenges, music continues to play an important role in our society. It provides opportunities for numerous activities, both formal and informal. Music is also beneficial to our well-being. Studies have shown that playing an instrument can improve cognitive skills, social relationships and concentration. As a result, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. In the long term, there are likely to be some changes in the way music is taught and performed. However, music will continue to play an important role in our lives."

The craft of acting can be seen as a form of expression that involves both physical and psychological elements. Actors often find themselves being criticized for their lack of professionalism or their inability to convey emotions effectively. However, there are some actors who are able to overcome these challenges and deliver powerful and memorable performances.
One such actor is Adrian Lester, who is known for his expressive and nuanced portrayal of the character Hamlet. Lester's ability to convey emotion through his body and voice is truly captivating. He is able to bring the character of Hamlet to life in a way that is both relatable and moving.
Another important aspect of acting is the relationship between the actor and the audience. The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the audience is close enough to the actor to hear, see, and feel what is going on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are also important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body.
When you visit the theatre, you want something done in a way you can't imagine. Otherwise, you may as well have stayed at home."

The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess.

The other group studies the naturally occurring, unlearnt behavior of animals.

I read somewhere that if you dig a deep hole, you can see the stars. I asked you to help me with my plan. I climbed down the well and fell into the water. I cracked my head and was dazed. I saw strange lights and stars. I was scared and relieved. You called down and asked if I was all right. I lay still and waited for help. You called out for help and I was pulled out of the well. I was tired and scared. I ran away and hid in the shadows. My mother and father came to see me. My mother screamed and my father shouted. I was sad and ashamed. I felt like I had done something wrong. I apologized to my parents. I was punished. I was grounded. I was not allowed to go out with my friends. I was sad and lonely."

Susan was widowed and her children were grown up. She was leaving her family home. The removers were removing everything from the house. It was a lovely house that she was leaving. The years she had spent there were hanging around in the air.
When the removers started to remove the furniture, Susan was surprised. She could easily imagine if she had warned the removers about the piano. But it was too late. The piano was being carried down the stairs and out of the front door. It tipped slightly and the removers had to carry it back up the stairs.
The children were laughing and relieved that the piano was finally gone. Susan was also laughing. She was glad that she had not cried. The whole process had cost so much it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned."

The internet opened up a new way for people to share their opinions about books. A popular online bookstore called Amazon allowed anyone to write a review of a book. This made it easy for people to see what other readers thought of a book. The reviews on Amazon were free and uncensored, which meant that people could say whatever they wanted about a book. However, there were some problems with the reviews. For example, some people wrote fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people wrote reviews that were too long or too short. Despite these problems, the reviews on Amazon were still a valuable tool for readers. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying."

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. But today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.
Today, artists are left to their own devices and we get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds. If an artist chooses a piece of text and writes it on a canvas, is the finished product a painting?
The artist's new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground.

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession that was only afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these things could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. She had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise.

A map is used to show the relations of points and features on the Earth's surface. It is determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements did not give much information about the actual distance. Direction is also an important element of a map, but for the ordinary traveller, it was not the most important thing. Written itineraries used to be popular for a long time, but maps are still used today. Certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, do not always show true directions. Landmarks along a route were sometimes indicated by signs. The history of cartography is the history of the increase in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of maps.

Language is a powerful tool that humans use to communicate and express themselves. It is an instinct that people have, like spiders spinning webs.

For example, warm and wet climates allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are full of different species. Cold and windy areas have fewer living things. The weather patterns that make up the climate are caused by air rising and mixing. Some of the air movement is due to the Earth's rotation. The sun is another important source of air movement.

In the forests of Madagascar, there lives a primate called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker. It bores through wood and probes cavities beneath the surface to find insect larvae. The aye-aye uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop.
Scientists have discovered how the aye-aye locates the insects hidden inside the wood. They found that the aye-aye can sense the cavity itself. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above."

One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. It contained three small grey badger cubs.

The cubs grew quickly and started to eat from a bottle. After a few days, they were feeding every four hours. Within a week, they had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented.
However, fate took a turn for the worse. One of the cubs, Willow, became lethargic and died. I was heartbroken. But fate worked in strange ways. Six days later, I found another male cub, Willow II, who had been abandoned by his mother. I took him in and he joined the fold.
The cubs grew and thrived. They were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. They were very active and would go for walks at dusk or late at night.
One day, I spotted some odder badgers in our field. They were probably looking for food. We were warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so I placed sheet metal over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
We started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With the help of local firms and a bus company, we were able to raise enough money to build the sett. The badgers moved into their new home and are doing well."

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley planned a trip to the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination. However, his trip was aborted because of crew insubordination. He returned to the seas a second time and published a chart of declination in 1701. This chart was used by sailors for many years.
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to retrace Halley's voyage. He wants to commemorate Halley's accomplishments and also collect scientific data. The expedition will involve making measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field."

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, and most alert. But the peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance.
The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length."

The best boat design combines old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He designed his own boat, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has a lot of new technology, but it also has some traditional features. My own boat is different. It is a small boat that is designed for sailing in the sea. It is old-fashioned, but it is also very comfortable. The boat has a coal stove for warmth and dryness, and cosy berths for sleeping. It is not a luxurious boat, but it is a good boat for sailing. The problem with old-fashioned boats is that they need a lot of looking after. If you have a bad injury, you might need to sell your boat. If you are looking for a new boat, you should consider a boat that is designed for sailing, not for luxury."

In the past few million years, humans and chimpanzees have not had much time to develop differences. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.
Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many similarities exist between humans and animals. For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees and sea otters. Monkeys also have a simple one-word language.
As for art, the earliest forms of human art may have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art.
There are some differences between human art and animal activities. Human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. But these differences don't seem to be fatal. Even some human art that later became famous was created by artists for their private satisfaction."

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very large and dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed it and wrote about his adventure. There are not many big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be full of them. Now you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life.
Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert. The team was composed of four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels and six camel handlers. The expedition was difficult because the camels had never worked with camels before and the desert was very harsh.
But Blackmore managed to complete his expedition and he feels proud of his achievement. He also feels grateful for his family and the happiness they share."

Eccentricity is when someone behaves in a way that is different from the way most people behave. It's like having two forces fighting inside you. One force is called individualism, which is the desire to be your own person and do your own thing. The other force is conformity, which is the desire to be accepted by others. Most of us have a desire to be accepted, so we tend to conform to the norms of our society. But we also have a desire to be ourselves, so we sometimes resist conformity. If you want to be eccentric, you need to be natural and not try to be someone you're not."

Book reviews play an important role in the success of books. Publishers and authors have different perspectives on reviews. Publishers rely on reviews to attract readers and generate sales. They often prefer positive reviews, as they believe that they can increase sales. Authors, on the other hand, are devastated by no reviews. They need reviews to promote their books and build their reputations.
However, book reviews can also have a negative impact on sales. If a book receives negative reviews, it can damage its reputation and make it less likely to be purchased. Despite the challenges, publishers need to continue to rely on book reviews to reach their target audience."

Young Masters Age is against Bobby Fischer as he tries to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man's game. After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. The game has also changed a lot over the past two decades. The new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The main goal of the modern master is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense, but now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. The game is played on a board, but much of modern chess is played off the board. The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire."

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, can have both positive and negative impacts. While volunteer tourists can contribute to building homes or schools, they often pay a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work. This money could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.
Volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, conflict resolution, and democratic participation. However, if volunteering is limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may not benefit people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work.
At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative or self-serving. At its best, it can bring benefits to individual volunteers and the organisations they work for, as well as provide space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience.
Volunteer tourism can also be seen as a way to help others. However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of volunteer tourism, such as the bypassing of democratic processes and the reduction of development to individual acts of charity."

The clock radio is a common device used to wake people up. To choose a good clock radio, you need to consider several factors. The 'dual alarm function' does not allow you to snooze or be driven out of bed. Instead, it allows you to set two different wake-up times. The inclusion of a cassette player is a great feature, allowing you to fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up to a day without news. The quality of the radio is excellent, but the size is a bit big. The clock has a self-power back-up and a wide snooze bar. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing. The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space'."

When a hedgehog is attacked, it can roll into a tight ball, with its spines pointing outwards. This is a good defence mechanism, but it depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines than other hedgehogs, so they are more likely to try to run into their attacker. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night, and they sleep for much of the day. They hibernate in the winter, but not all hedgehogs do this. In suitable conditions, some hedgehogs will stay awake all year round. '

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main problem with advertising is that it has not been able to keep up with the pace of economic change. As a result, most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised.
When you're watching TV, you probably see a lot of commercials for brands you don't buy. Most people only register a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest. This is called waste.
However, advertising can still be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved that it is. Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all.
So, if you are an advertiser, you need to make sure your advertising campaign is tightly targeted. If you can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population), you will be doing well."

The camera can lie. Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. But in 1920, he thought he was seeing scientific proof that fairies really existed. He published photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. Today, we are used to computer software enabling us to rework our digital images. It is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence.

I'm 34 years old and I'm nervous about backpacking. I've done it before, but I've been busy with my job and relationship. I decided to quit my job and rent out my flat to go travelling in South East Asia for a year.
There are a lot of reasons why people are travelling in their late twenties and thirties. Some people want to disentangle themselves from their lives and head off to foreign climes. Others want to have a final fling before settling down. And still others want to get rid of their old approach to life and start over.
There are also a number of factors that make it easier to travel in your late twenties and thirties. There's a much more flexible workforce today, and there are more people working on short-term contracts. Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies.

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you have to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. You also need to be aware of the camera's effect on these.
To photograph people effectively, you should follow these steps:
1. Group people in a way that is visually appealing.
2. Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
3. Avoid making it seem like you are taking a picture when you are not.
4. Make eye contact with your subject and ask them to look into the lens.
5. Use expressions and gestures to convey the subject's mood.
6. Consider the background and environment to add interest and information to the picture.
7. Include interaction between people in the picture.
8. Take pictures of people in their natural environment.
9. Decide whether you want to pose or not pose your subject."

Sarah Janson is an artist who creates illusions of reality through her paintings. She is not interested in being known as the artist who created the work, but rather the artist who made the work. Janson has been painting trompe-l'oeil for sixteen years and has a string of major corporate and private commissions behind her.

When Janson finishes a painting, she often feels that she has not done it justice. She is also brutally honest about her 'failings' and is frank about her mathematical abilities.

The media can earn money from content they don't own. Social media has made it easier to capture newsworthy events. Sometimes, journalists use images from social media to report on news stories. Unfortunately, some reporters have published UGC (user-generated content) without permission. There is a debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that a lot of people film or photograph news events. This means that UGC has a big part to play in the future of the media. To keep the public's trust, the media needs to take steps to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought."

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used for centuries. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has been the most popular.
Acupuncture points are located along meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or sick.
To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin at specific points on the meridians. They may also use warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on the meridians.
Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including back pain, arthritis, headaches, and migraines. It is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, such as menstrual pain and facial nerve pain.
If you are considering acupuncture for pain relief, it is important to find a qualified acupuncturist. You should also discuss your condition with your doctor to see if acupuncture is right for you."

P. D. James, a best-selling crime writer, is known for her intricate and brilliant imagination. She is a quiet and modest person, but her books are read avidly by millions worldwide.
James was born in Oxford and grew up mainly in Cambridge. She met her husband, a student at the university, and had two daughters. Her life has been hard, even tragic at times, but she has persevered and achieved great success.
James worked full-time in administration for the National Health Service and made good use of her organizational skills. She also became 'quite accustomed' to seeing corpses while working in forensic science. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. It was the shape and construction involved in writing a crime novel that appealed to her.
James believes that writing detective stories is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life, even if that life is unlovable."

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.
A professional graphologist, Patricia Marne, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'"

Chewing gum is a popular fashion accessory in the United States. Americans chew a lot of gum, with an estimated 12 million sticks being chewed daily. Gum is made from a variety of ingredients, including pine resins, softeners, and flavourings. The ancient Greeks and American colonists chewed a gum-like resin obtained from trees. Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree. Today, chewing gum is mostly made synthetically. As the chewing gum market has grown, manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks the plants and takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands."

Living in the valley, we had been living there for sixteen months. One day, we realized that the hills surrounding our valley could be dangerous. It was the year when the storms came early. The snow started to fall and it was deep. It blocked our lane and made the path slippery. The wind blew fiercely and the trees swayed. But the snow and wind did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river that threatened us most. The river flowed wildly and it was deep. If the dam had not been built, the river would have flooded our village. The dam holds the water back and prevents it from flowing too fast. Now, we can enjoy the huge clouds that hang over the valley and be thrilled by the tremendous power of the river."

My first job as a writer was writing articles about films for The Front Page newspaper. Before that, I had done some reviewing of novels and films. I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me.
I chose film as my area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be."

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying to wonderful locations or appearing on the covers of magazines, she is usually studying for her school exams. One day, the receptionist at the agency told Jane that Kira would be late. Jane was trying to convince herself that all the bad things she had read about models were not true, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into her head. When Kira arrived, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic. She was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. Kira explained that all models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. Now, Kira has to manage her two separate lives. She has a lot of friends and teachers who are proud of her success, but there are also a few unkind people at her school who are rude about her success. However, Kira is not letting this get her down. She is confident and has a bright future ahead of her."

Father and son, Terence and Chris Madden, travelled from Canada to Africa to find gold. They have a mine on the side of a Welsh mountain that could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they are convinced that they are close to a five million dollar vein of gold.
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. They started their search after the father read about pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. Since they started their work, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. Now they are running short of money and need to convince a backer to put money into the project.
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
The dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to gather samples, and then three hours to get back up to the surface. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released.
Last year, Rachel dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes.
It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder."

I was tired, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more. I said, ""Never again,"" as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year and the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe.
The train trip was a valuable personal experience. It was a chance to escape the guided tour and do something different. I took great pride in the fact that I could see the view from the station in many places. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.
Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience."

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you will have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, airlines lose luggage, even the best ones. It is impossible to guarantee that your luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when there is a change of aircraft. To make sure your luggage arrives safely, you should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If a change of plane is unavoidable, try to fly the same airline throughout and allow more connecting time. If your luggage is lost, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."

The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It feeds on fish. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast. It has a powerful image that lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He has a deep feeling for this little bird. He can't identify just what it is that draws him to it. The kingfisher is the stuff of legend. There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue. The kingfisher is a popular bird to photograph. It is easy to watch from a hideout. You can see a kingfisher in a woodland stream. If you are interested in photography, you might like to photograph kingfishers."

Running a business in the countryside is a rewarding experience for many women. There are a few challenges, but there are also many advantages.
A few women talk about their experiences setting up a business in the countryside. Some of the women run businesses that are related to their hobbies, such as design, art, and publishing. Other women run businesses that are related to their skills, such as curtain-making and cake-baking.
One of the biggest challenges of running a business in the countryside is the lack of financial support. It can be difficult to get loans or find investors. However, there are also a number of advantages to running a business in the countryside, such as the ability to work from home and the ability to be your own boss.
Overall, running a business in the countryside can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. It is important to be aware of the challenges, but it is also important to focus on the many advantages."

If a child has a natural talent for music, it can be difficult to know how to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may not recognize or respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. Most schools are not able to deal with children who are especially able in music. If a child has a lot of musical ability, they may benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.
There are five music schools in Britain that offer a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms.
There are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find the necessary fees. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school. Finally, it can be stressful to be a musically gifted child. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed."

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks the plants and takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The poppies also come out at the same time. She finds it fascinating to see how the flowers change and grow. She has always been interested in plants. She used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands."

Everyone has a chance in life, and John believes that his son Gary was given his chance with cooking. When John heard about the opportunity, he rushed to look at the place. It was in a really bad state, but it was perfect for what he had in mind.
John's wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all his accounts, while he ran the business. They lived over the restaurant and always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. Their children, Gary and Joe, are both very confident. From a very early age, Gary would come down and talk to the regular customers. It's given both of them a great start in life.
Gary was quite a lively child when he was really small. He had discipline and was always up even before his dad in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see Gary helping out. By the age of 15, Gary was as good as any of the men working there. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair.
John's advice to Gary would be: if you start chasing two hares, you end up catching neither, so chase the hare you know you're going to catch. Gary went to catering college at the age of 17 and was successful. No one can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. John is extremely proud of him."

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent and sensitive to human emotions. They also allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.
There are many different kinds of dolphins. Some dolphins live far out in the open sea, while others live near to coasts. The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common kinds of dolphin. Bottlenoses are social creatures that live in groups. They are often seen in river mouths and coastal waters.
One of the biggest threats to dolphins is pollution. Pollutants can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can cause a number of health problems. Another threat to dolphins is overfishing. If fish are caught in fishermen's nets, they may not be able to find food or they may be injured. Human disturbance is also a major threat to dolphins. Noise pollution from ships and oil wells can disturb dolphins and make it difficult for them to communicate.
Dolphins are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to regulate the food chain and they are a source of joy for people all over the world. It is important to protect dolphins so that they can continue to live and thrive."

Chris Greener was tall when he was young. He is the tallest man in Britain. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Today, most people eat a diet that is based on three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet has had a negative impact on human health. However, there is a positive trend. The average man in the US, Holland, and Japan is now taller than he was in the past. This is due to improved nutrition. However, there are also some problems. For example, leg-room in planes and trains has shrunk. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever.

Matthew likes the Hartland Peninsula. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks. He prefers to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys.
Annette's favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and she likes the feeling of space.
James purchased Glenthorne, his favourite house in Britain. It was a question of obtaining pure peace and reconnecting with his English roots. He grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve went to school in Devon, in the west of England. He used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. He finds Glenthorne to be a magical, secluded, romantic house."

We love animals. One day, my daughter found a pine snake. We decided to keep it overnight. I was late getting home and when I arrived, there was a crisis. Domino the cat and Bianca the mouse were running around the bedroom. I tried to help, but I tripped over something and fell on the floor. The snake escaped and I was scared. I crouched like a rabbit and the snake was hissing and striking at me. I managed to capture Domino and pull the mouse from its jaws. I looked the snake over for weak points, but it didn't have any. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer and the snake relaxed. I eventually released the snake and it went away."

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. But to me, there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. It's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and the enjoyment of the contents.
I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. I started writing to my mom when I was young. My mom always insisted that I write my own thank-you letters. When I left home to train as a doctor, I would write once a week. My parents and I wrote letters to each other regularly. I also wrote letters to my boyfriends. It was a way to stay in touch.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. I also appreciate notes, but I like to have a lot of news. It's better to have a year's supply of news than a few notes. I have penfriends in different countries. I have a penfriend in France, Australia, and Vancouver. I also have a penfriend in Texas.
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition of letter writing. Like my mom before me, I insist that they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter and son have penfriends of their own. I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 'lost art'."

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.
The drawings are being damaged rapidly and will not survive for future generations. People are stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs.
Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site but charge a fee.
The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there. If we do not take steps, the drawings will be lost for future generations."

Young shoppers often go to the supermarket with their parents. Sometimes, they want everything they see. If it's not the latest cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents sometimes have a hard time deciding which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. They also admit they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas."

Once upon a time, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, there is a climber named Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also has a climbing wall. The climbing wall is made of bricks with special edges that climbers can hold on to. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls have many holds that climbers can use to grip and climb."

If you want to become an actor, it's a risky career. There are a lot of actors, but not enough jobs. If you choose to become an actor, people may tell you that you're crazy. But it's a personal choice and only you can take responsibility for yourself. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You need talent and luck. There is a demand for new faces and new talent. Acting is all about making contact with the audience. If you ask actors how they have done well, they will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted. Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. You need to be prepared for rejection. If you don't care enough, no-one will care for you."

Chris Greener was tall when he was young. He is the tallest man in Britain. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Today, most people eat a diet that is based on three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet has had a negative impact on human health. However, there is a positive trend. The average man in the US, Holland, and Japan is now taller than he was in the past. This is due to improved nutrition. However, there are also some problems. For example, leg-room in planes and trains has shrunk. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some programmed upper limit."

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are playing a game called pichenotte. It's a game that their grandfather brought to the USA from Canada. The game is popular in their home state of New Mexico. They have made their own boards and are selling them to people.
Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. The pucks are flicked across a board using the middle or index finger of one hand. If you flick a puck into a small hole, you get 20 points. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
The Lagasses have made a lot of money from selling their boards. They have sold more than 450 boards. They are made of birchwood and mahogany, and they weigh 12kg. You can buy one of their boards for $595."

Welcome to the Model Village. When you first enter the village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago, this was just wasteland. The village was built by one man, Colin Sims, and his wife. They worked hard to change the wasteland into the beautiful village you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to create the village. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were also planted. The models in the village are made from a variety of materials, including stone, concrete, and wood. They are very detailed and accurate. The village is popular and is known for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. You can also enjoy the village by pressing the buttons on some of the working models. We hope you enjoy your visit to the Model Village."

Every week, British newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often include celebrities and other people who are in the public eye. Sometimes, these pictures are very private and can be very hurtful to the people who are pictured. However, very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is an organization that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. The PCC has not launched an investigation into any of the recent stories about celebrities' privacy. This is a scandal. The PCC should take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. It would be a good idea to have the PCC take on this role of 'police officer'. However, there are some problems with this idea. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry. And it would also be embarrassing for the people who are pictured."

A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. If you are taking a real step on the career ladder and choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions, you need to ask yourself what you want to achieve in the long term. You should choose your second job very carefully and aim to stay in it for two to three years. It should be a job that extends you, develops you and gives you increasing responsibility. If you have the travel bug, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see that you have got it out of your system and are not likely to go off again."

Paul Forster went to a kite-flying festival in Malaysia. He spent a nervous night in the forest. He was given a kite that was traditional and had plenty of other kites. They sat down in the shade of the trees and looked at the festival. The kites flew into the air like rockets. There was a competition with more than 500 men and boys. Each had entered four different designs. The festival ran for five days. Paul decided to stay in a hut in the forest. Night was totally black and there was a lot of different sounds. In the morning there was a tremendous view over the mountains. It rained in the afternoon. Paul slid downhill and wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the enormous drops. He was glad that his car was still there. No one is a stranger for long in Kelantan."

What kind of shopper are you? Everyone goes shopping, but there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around and found out that there are different types of shoppers. Some people are addicted to shopping, like Melanie and her boyfriend.

They know what they want and they get in and out as quickly as they can."
