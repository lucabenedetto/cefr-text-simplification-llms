Garbage collection is a ritual that is free in most places. It involves collecting rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins and carrying them away to the local tip. If rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish, people would have to buy less of just about everything.

If you charge households for the rubbish they produce, you will see a reduction in the amount of rubbish that is collected. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex and intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out.<eos>"

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.

The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, which means that there are centralised resources intended and suited for spreading and reproduction.

Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, it is striking that it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.

In the early 1930s, there were attempts to experiment with other forms of organisation. But these attempts were not successful. The most adequate organisation of the medium was centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience.<eos>"

Sometimes it feels like no matter how much stuff you have, you don't feel secure. It's natural to want to create a comfortable home, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising plays on our insecurities.

Music and theatre are two different art forms that offer unique experiences to audiences. Up until recently, I believed that opera was primarily a form of theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music takes precedence in opera. The music is the foundation of the performance, and it is what makes the event truly captivating.

In contrast to music audiences, theatre audiences have different expectations. They mainly focus on the actor's skill and are not necessarily impressed by elaborate speeches or complex musical arrangements. While it is understandable to admire the skill of performers, it is important to recognize that theatre audiences have different needs and preferences than music audiences.

Despite these differences, there is a common thread that binds music and theatre audiences together - their shared passion for the arts. Both groups of people appreciate the power of music and theatre to evoke emotions, inspire creativity, and bring joy to their lives.<eos>"

Sand is a nuisance when it is in its natural state. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you. It is also hard to remove. However, when you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car, or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, the sand falls off you. It can stay with you for a long time, but you can keep it away by locking it up.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film often involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point.

The studio where I worked was a complex place. It was made up of many different buildings, and it was difficult to find your way around. But the studio lacked a focus. It would have been much better if there had been a single main entrance.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham were like row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. The chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked on someone's front path. Most of my early life I've forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was quite the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked. It was as if a giant paperweight, composed of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her cronies, the obligation to 'behave proper', lay across my shoulders, and that it was my duty immediately to grow up and start the work of prising it free.<eos>"

I live on Philadelphia Avenue, on the odd-numbered side. The evening was dark, and the air was thick with rain. I knew this side of the street well. There are many houses on my street, and I have many memories of playing with my friends there.

The houses on my street are different from the houses on the other side of the street. The porches on the other side of the street are lower to the ground, and the front yards are smaller. Over the years, there have been changes to the houses on my street. The wooden porch banisters and pillars have been replaced by wrought iron.

I also have a lot of memories of swimming in the pool. One day, I was swimming in the pool and I noticed that the rain was falling. I hurried across the lawn and took shelter in the pool. The rain fell hard, and the water splashed all over me. It was a lot of fun.

I have a dream of swimming through Britain. I want to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea. I want to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage.<eos>"

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness.<eos>"

The Earth is getting warmer, and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water, and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.

One of the biggest problems is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system. Despite this, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.

The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. Some of the most obvious changes include rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns, and more extreme weather events. These changes are having a negative impact on many ecosystems and human societies.

However, there are also some potential benefits to climate change. For example, some countries have seen increased food production due to warmer temperatures. And, climate change is also making it easier to transport oil and gas.

The consequences of climate change are serious, but there are steps that can be taken to mitigate the effects. These steps include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in renewable energy, and adopting sustainable land use practices.<eos>"

Art is a powerful form of human expression that involves the creation and appreciation of aesthetic objects. These objects exist physically and are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they are housed. However, the very perfection of some of these products and their prestige can sometimes get in the way of understanding them. When artistic objects are separated from their original context and operation, they become isolated and difficult to understand. To understand art, we need to forget it for a time and turn aside from it to have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. Once we have understood the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, we can appreciate art in the context of our daily lives.<eos>"

The early 1990s were a tough time for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes. Advertising people felt particularly under pressure because they were seen as the ones who were spearheading efforts to support the bottom line. They also had to deal with the problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets.

However, despite all of these challenges, there has been a rise in the perceived importance of marketing. Companies are now making sure that they are producing services and goods that their customers want, rather than what it is convenient for them to provide. This has led to increased attention being given to marketing activities and the acquisition of new learning about the subject.

The advertising industry has been through a lot of changes in recent years. There have been high production costs and a decline in the willingness to take risks. There have also been changes in the needs and desires of consumers, the rise of sponsorship, and legal restrictions on advertising. All of these factors have made it difficult for advertising professionals to do their jobs effectively.<eos>"

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can make us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.

Reading and travel can help us escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place.

To make ends meet, writers can either write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs, or they can be literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a bit of teaching, the occasional workshop and articles.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in major state occasions and provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal. It is also beneficial to our health and well-being.

There are a number of benefits to playing an instrument. It can improve cognitive skills, social relationships, concentration and mood. It can also help us to learn other skills, such as punctuality and organization. For all these reasons, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.

In the future, there are likely to be a number of changes in the music industry. New genres of music will develop and there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music.

There are a lot of potential benefits to sharing information online, such as wealth and fame. However, there are also risks associated with sharing information online, such as the possibility of being targeted or harassed.

In the early days of the internet, people began to use the web to share their lives. One of the first bloggers, Justin Hall, started a blog in 1996 and his story is a cautionary tale about the risks of sharing information online. Hall's blog was popular, but it was also controversial. He was criticized for being too exhibitionistic and for not respecting people's privacy.

Another example of the risks associated with sharing information online is the story of Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles. In 2002, an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company. As a result, Armstrong was fired from her job.

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well, but I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in the story. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose.

Oral History

The trend of historians relying on oral evidence has its challenges. It is not always accurate to assume that someone's testimony represents the pure truth of the past. Historians have a responsibility to acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. However, even the informant is not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be influenced by other sources, nostalgia, or personal grievances. The feelings and attitudes expressed in testimony can be powerful, but they may not reflect the actual events of the past.

Although there is some overlap, there are distinct disciplines within each approach. Psychologists study learning abilities in a restricted range of species, while ethologists focus on naturally occurring behaviour in animals.

The Social Sciences

Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance of the subject and the methodology at the same time. Each social science discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts. To understand a social science, you need to be familiar with its basic ideas and how they are used to go beyond common sense.

Classical Architecture

Classical architecture was much more than just the construction of buildings. It was an art form that emphasized aesthetics over function. The origins of classical architecture are complex, but the basic principles persisted into later sophisticated architectural concepts.<eos>"

The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a long time. They would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air. Chen was amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. He was happy that Lily had mastered this new skill.

They decided to go on a journey together. They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. They left early in the morning and returned by midday. Lily drove impeccably. She overtook a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve. Chen went as far as applauding.

They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

The journey was over and Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake.<eos>"

I read somewhere that if you dig a deep hole, you can see the stars. I asked you to help me with my plan, and you watched as I lowered a bucket into the well and climbed in. I told you to let me down, but I did not think about the weight of the bucket or your lack of strength. You held the handle and took some of the strain as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well. I fell into the well and cracked my head. I was scared and relieved, and I was angry at you for letting me fall. You called down and asked if I was all right. I lay still and waited for you to come and help me. You disappeared and called out for help. I waited a moment, then quickly hauled and pushed my way to the top. I ran away and hid in the shadows.

The internet opened up a new way for people to share their opinions about books. Anyone can now write a review on Amazon, which is the largest online bookstore. This means that potential buyers can see what other readers thought of a book, for better or worse. However, there are some problems with this system. For example, there is a lot of fake reviews and it is difficult to tell if a review is really from the author. Despite these problems, the reviews on Amazon can still be a valuable tool for buyers.

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.

There is a new situation that I want to talk about. An artist chooses a piece of text and asks someone to write it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. But is it really?

The problem is that there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam. If an artist tries to strike out in a new direction, they will usually be met with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side.<eos>"

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession that was only affordable by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. But it had turned out to be a bad decision. The flat wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room. All these things could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. She had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise.

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message that stirred the audience, nor was it a great performance, he believed that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable, he was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience.<eos>"

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but few of us know what their lives were like. Diaries and family anecdotes are incomplete and sometimes forgotten. We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos instead of photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional.

Hannah Renier has come up with a solution: she writes other people's autobiographies. She writes a hardback book of at least 20,000 words - with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.

The process of writing a biography involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews. Ms Renier uses the interviews to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. The final content is as good as its subject.

Each book costs nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each. The cost is inevitable with the time involved.<eos>"

Science flying in the face of gravity. Journalist Tom Mumford joined students using weightlessness to test their theories. It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft. The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. After that, the aircraft became weightless and floated aimlessly for 20 seconds. We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else. After that, the aircraft returned to gravity and landed smoothly. The students were excited about their experience and felt that it was an unforgettable one.<eos>"

Six years ago, my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' and have established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. One day, I was surprised to see a cardboard box being canned towards me. Inside, there were three small grey badger cubs. I had never seen badger cubs before and was amazed by their soft, velvet coats and milky-coloured eyes.

The cubs were cold and whimpering, so I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. I fed them every four hours and they soon began to progress. After a few weeks, they were able to drink from a bottle and move around.

One day, I noticed that one of the cubs, Willow, was lethargic. It was a warning sign, but I didn't react straightaway. The next morning, I found that Willow had died from a lung infection. I was heartbroken, but I continued rearing the other two cubs.

A few days later, I found another orphaned cub and named him Willow II. He was much younger than the females and had a difficult time eating. But eventually, I was able to help him to eat and grow.

The badgers are very territorial and will kill others that wander into their territory. To protect the cubs, I placed sheet metal over the gate to their pen.

We built a sett for the badgers and they moved into it early one evening. Now, I see the badgers only occasionally, but I am still happy that I was able to help them.<eos>"

Sir Edmund Halley was a famous astronomer who lived in the 17th century. He is best known for his discovery of the comet that bears his name. One of his greatest accomplishments was to chart the variations of the compass. These variations are now known as declination. Without declination, sailors were unable to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley led a remarkable life. He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the positions of the stars, and also found time for other interests.

Dr. Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore. He hopes that his measurements will plug any gaps in the coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.<eos>"

Peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their magnificent trains to the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day. Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation. He believed that the fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, and most alert. But the peacocks tail was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance.

The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try to settle the matter. They have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?

The mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.<eos>"

The best boat design combines old and new. Tom Cunliffe says that. He designed his own boat, 'The Westerman', which is at the Summer Boat Show in London this week. The boat has a lot of new technology, but it also has some traditional features. It's a beautiful boat, but it's also very expensive.

My own boat is much simpler. It's not as fast or as comfortable as The Westerman, but it's still a good boat. It has a coal stove for warmth and dryness, and cosy berths for sleeping. It's also easy to sail.

The problem with old-fashioned boats is that they need a lot of looking after. If you have a bad injury, you might need to sell your boat. If you can't afford to buy a new boat, you might need to build one yourself.

But if you're looking for a boat that is both beautiful and functional, The Westerman is the perfect boat for you.<eos>"

In the past few million years, humans have not developed any significant differences from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to a small number of genes.

Modern studies of animal behaviour have shown that many attributes once considered uniquely human are also used by animals. For example, tools are used by humans and chimpanzees, and sea otters crack open clams with rocks. As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'.

If human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, it's strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved.

There are three main distinctions between human art and animal activities. First, human art is non-utilitarian, while animal art is utilitarian. Second, human art is made for aesthetic pleasure, while animal art is made for survival or reproduction. Third, human art is learned, while animal art is instinctive.

However, these distinctions are not entirely clear. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions. And even some human art that later became famous was created by artists for their private satisfaction.<eos>"

When asked why they had bought a particular book, more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence. Reviews can be positive or negative, but they can have a significant impact on book sales.

There are a few things that publishers and authors need to keep in mind when it comes to reviews. First, they need to be aware of the different requirements of newspapers and magazines versus publishing houses. Second, they need to understand that reviews are not always about the content of the book, but also about the size and popularity of the book. Third, they need to be aware that reviews can be very unpredictable and that they should not rely on them entirely.

International voluntary work, also known as volunteer tourism, is a topic that is discussed by four academic writers. They argue that while volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, the financial impact of their contributions is often limited. The money that volunteers pay for the opportunity to be involved in this work could potentially be used to pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide.

However, volunteering can also lead to greater international understanding, enhanced ability to solve conflicts, and widespread and democratic participation in global affairs. It can also contribute to the growth of international social networks among ordinary people.

At its worst, international volunteering can be exploitative and self-serving. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities.

Volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development.<eos>"

When a hedgehog is attacked, it can roll into a tight ball, with its spines pointing outwards. This is a good defence mechanism, but it depends on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines and are more likely to try to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep for much of the day. They hibernate in the winter, but some hedgehogs choose to stay awake all year round.<eos>"

Talking shops are designed to make you spend money. They use different techniques to attract customers.

One technique is to make the store look fresh and inviting. Supermarkets often put fresh produce at the front of the store or display plants. They may also have a bakery that smells like fresh bread. The store's fixtures may also be colored to match the fresh produce.

Another technique is to display products in a way that makes them seem more desirable. For example, products that are sold at a high price may be placed in a more prominent location. Products that sell quickly, even if they are not very profitable, may also be placed in a prominent location.

Supermarkets also use lighting to attract customers. They often use special lighting to make certain foods look more appealing. They may also use mirrors to make the store seem larger.

Finally, supermarkets often use in-store promotions to attract customers. These promotions can include giant photographs of food, video trolleys that advertise products, and free samples.<eos>"

By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. That success just can't be attributed to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone. I couldn't stop myself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps these are the secrets, perhaps these are the real reasons behind Kenya's rise to the top of world distance running.<eos>"

Advertising is not doing well. It started to decline early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. The main reason for the decline is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.

People don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. However, advertising can be cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.

If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond, there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly.<eos>"

Solar Survivor Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home, Southwell in Nottinghamshire. The house is designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. There is a monastic stillness in the house. The Vales designed a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. They also designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water. The house is cheap to build and inexpensive to run.<eos>"

Arthur Conan Doyle, known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting and thought they were real. He published the photographs alongside an article acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted that they were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The photographs are undeniably beautiful. However, the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we use software to edit our digital images. It is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being altered.<eos>"

Throughout the ages, iron has been a powerful force in human imagination. Blacksmiths have been skilled craftsmen who have been admired for their work. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were highly respected and were often compared to doctors and astrologers. They also produced beautiful artwork, such as the ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral.

Over the past few years, there has been a revival of blacksmithing. This is due to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Many blacksmiths are now able to express themselves more freely thanks to power tools. They can bend, split, twist, and spot-weld the metal with relative ease.

The blacksmiths craft is a fascinating one. It is a combination of art and engineering. Blacksmiths are artists who use metal to create beautiful and functional pieces. Their work can be seen in homes, museums, and public spaces.<eos>"

I stopped smoking a few months ago. It was a difficult decision, but I knew I had to do it. I had been smoking for many years, and I was addicted. I had tried to quit before, but I had always failed. This time, I was determined to succeed.

The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I did not intend to stop smoking, but I was persuaded to try. I was told that I could smoke as much as I wanted, but I found that I was not able to resist the temptation.

After a few days, I started to feel better. The cravings for nicotine went away, and I was able to concentrate on my work more easily. I was also able to sleep better. I had always smoked to help me relax, but I found that I was able to relax more without cigarettes.

However, I did have some difficulties. Pottering around at home on weekend mornings was the most difficult thing. I also had to deal with the fact that I was no longer able to smoke in public spaces. But I knew that these difficulties were worth it. I was healthier, and I was happier.<eos>"

We changed lives for a day! Have you ever dreamed of swapping lives with someone else for a day? It would be more fun to do something quite different for a change. We fixed it for four people - read how it went.

Amanda, a young mother, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant and entertainment complex. It was a busy day for Amanda. She had to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height and deal with the constant loud music. It was also tiring to stand up in front of the class and speak.

Cindy, a teacher, swapped lives with Rosemary, who runs a dairy farm. It was a lonely day for Cindy. She spent most of the morning bottling milk and squeezing ice-cream from a machine. It was also exhausting to stand up in front of the class and speak.

The two stories show that swapping lives is not always what it seems. It is a lot of work and can be very tiring. But it is also a rewarding experience that can give you a new perspective on your own life.<eos>"

Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.

A good leader is one who inspires, motivates, and encourages others. Leadership is not about being tall or intelligent. It's about making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are. To be a good leader, you should be able to speak out clearly and with conviction. You should also be able to motivate others and inspire them to achieve their goals.

There are a few things you can do to improve your leadership skills. First, find out where your passions and convictions lie. Next, start thinking of yourself as a leader. Third, experiment with your style and see what works best for you. Finally, set goals and work hard to achieve them.

Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes. To be a successful leader, you need to be able to delegate and motivate others, organise and chastise, praise and raise.<eos>"

The film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases. He reviews A Abyss Long Before Titanic, The Thin Red Line, On Guard, Character, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

A Abyss Long Before Titanic is a Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water. The film has impressive production design and special effects, but the dialogue and characterisation are not as strong.

The Thin Red Line is a war movie about the battle for Guadalcanal. The film is well-made, but it is not as complex or rich as Malick's version. The flashback sequence is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus imagery.

On Guard is a swashbuckler film. It is corny but highly watchable. The film has a consummate villain and an exuberant hero.

Character is a dour tale set in turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The film has excessive production and costume design, but the storytelling is not as strong as the production design.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a digitally re-mastered war epic. The sound editing is impressive, but the storytelling is relentless and cruel.

The Longest Day is a war epic with a lot of extras and a lot of action. However, the early sequences drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers.<eos>"

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photograph with someone in it is usually more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. To photograph people well, you have to be aware of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a negative effect on these.

To photograph people effectively, you should consider the following tips:

* Group people at different angles and distances to avoid straight lines.
* Help your subject relax and find a comfortable position.
* Make sure the subject is not overwhelmed by the background.
* Ask your subject to look into the lens or concentrate on something within the picture area.
* Look for familiar expressions and gestures that tell us more about the subject.
* Use a standard or wide-angle lens to show people against a relevant background.
* If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be far easier to do.
* Take pictures of people in action and interaction.
* To pose or not to pose? Decide why you want to take the picture and then act accordingly.<eos>"

The media can earn money from content they don't own. Social media has made it easier to capture newsworthy events. With news regularly breaking on social networks, some journalists are now turning to them as sources of images as fast-moving events occur. Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, there is ongoing debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that a significant number of people would film or photograph a news event. Therefore, UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media. To maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must take steps to ensure that people are properly rewarded for their work and that permission is always sought.<eos>"

Ancient Chinese medicine, also known as acupuncture, is a traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received the most attention in the West.

Acupuncture points are related to meridians, which are lines of energy that flow through the body. When the flow of energy is disrupted, the body becomes unbalanced and can become weak or ill.

To treat pain, acupuncturists use fine needles inserted into the skin at specific points on the meridians. They may also use warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on the meridians.

Acupuncture can be effective for treating a variety of pain conditions, including chronic long-term pain, back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine. It is also used during surgery to reduce pain.

It is important to note that acupuncture is not a substitute for medical treatment. If you are experiencing pain, you should consult with a doctor to discuss your treatment options.<eos>"

The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. It can be used to indicate certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.

Handwriting can also be used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology.

According to Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says, 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden. With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently.<eos>"

Living in the valley, we had been there for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills. It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter. Until that time, we felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills. Soon snow began to fall. It was deep and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. The wind blasted fiercely. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed gently, that threatened us most. The river was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds. And then it happened - the reservoir overflowed. The river seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.<eos>"

Film critic Mark Adams has been writing articles about films for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. It was his first proper job. Before that, he had done some reviewing for other newspapers and magazines. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not primarily a journalist. He had a different idea for the team of critics. He thought that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge. There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make their choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided they should cover. It all felt like a dream at that time. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help Mark personally, and was pretending to employ him. Mark felt lacking in self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of his reviews appeared, he didn't know where to look. Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but it didn't work out as planned. Mark chose film as his area of focus. Without Tom's initial push, they would hardly have come up with the present arrangement. The space he is given allows him to broaden his argument or forces him, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing.<eos>"

No title. We always go to Ireland in June. Every year, the four of us have spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds bought the house and have added to it, but everything has been done discreetly.

We've been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. We call me Milly, though strictly speaking my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland.

When we arrived at Glencorn Lodge, Mrs Malseed was waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. She painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.

We played cards for a while but not going on for as long as we might because we were still quite tired after the journey. In the evening, there was a man on his own and a French couple. We walked along the sands to Ardbeag and had coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we drove somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed.<eos>"

Jerome says that many people are afraid to go to the dentist. To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. He has introduced relaxation techniques such as virtual-reality headsets and a pleasant smell in the surgery. The surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. The quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them.<eos>"

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is a popular treat worldwide. People in Britain spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter and Christmas. The cacao plant, which is the source of chocolate, was first cultivated by the Aztecs, Toltecs and Mayans thousands of years ago. The fruit of the cacao tree contains seeds that can be used to make chocolate. In the past, chocolate was made from solid blocks that had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, a Dutch inventor named CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate. Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week.<eos>"

I was tired, smelly, hungry and tanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body and mind couldn't handle any more punishment. I was glad to be home. I said exactly the same thing the following year and the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe.

The train trip was a valuable personal experience. It was a chance to escape the guided tour and do something different. I took great pride in the fact that I could see the view from the station in many places. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience.<eos>"

There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas and finding that your baggage has been left behind. If your luggage is not with you, you will have to wear the clothes you stand up in for hours or days until the airline reunites you with your luggage. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage.

The system for baggage handling works like this. Airlines require passengers to check in at a specific time before departure. This is designed to allow enough time for baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are exaggerated to allow for baggage transfers. In normal circumstances, the system works well. But extra security checks and problems with air traffic can cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail.

If your luggage is lost, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.<eos>"

The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers. It feeds on fish. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast. It has a powerful image that lingers. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. He has a deep feeling for this little bird. He can't identify just what it is that draws him to it. The kingfisher is the stuff of legend. There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue. The kingfisher is a popular bird to photograph. It is easy to watch from a hideout. You can see a kingfisher in a woodland stream. If you are interested in photography, you might want to learn more about kingfishers.<eos>"

To help a child who shows exceptional musical ability, there are a few options. One option is to attend a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five specialist music schools that provide a sympathetic environment for gifted children aged between seven and eighteen. These schools offer a wide range of musical activities, including individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory.

However, there are some disadvantages to attending a specialist music school. One disadvantage is the cost. The fees are high, but each school will make every effort to help parents find financial assistance. Another disadvantage is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a very early age.

If you are considering sending your child to a specialist music school, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully. If you are not sure whether your child is ready for such an intense and disciplined environment, you may want to consider other options, such as a school with a first-class music department or a normal school routine combined with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges.<eos>"

Artist Susan Shepherd is known for her flower paintings. She has a large garden that is full of her favourite flowers, mostly tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the flower borders that line the paved path. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners. They left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny.

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole. She picks them and then takes them up to her studio. She takes one flower out and paints it, which might take a few days. Then, she brings in another flower and builds up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out. The gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside. Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden. With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently.<eos>"

Jo went on climbing and met a punk named Pauline. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to.<eos>"

Dolphins are popular animals that people love to see. They are intelligent, sensitive to human emotions, and allow us to dream of freedom. However, dolphins are facing a number of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance.

There are many different kinds of dolphins. The most common ones are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the harbour porpoise. Bottlenoses are particularly social and live in large groups. Harbour porpoises are smaller and live in smaller groups.

The main cause of death for dolphins is being caught in fishermen's nets. Other threats to dolphins include pollution and human disturbance. Pollution can build up in the bodies of dolphins and can be passed on to their young. Human disturbance can disturb dolphins in ways that we do not yet understand.

In order to protect dolphins, we need to take steps to reduce pollution, overfishing, and human disturbance. We also need to work to educate people about the importance of dolphins to the ecosystem.<eos>"

In their natural habitat, film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman are often away from their home comforts for months on end. They are searching for the perfect shot. Two of the hardest creatures to track down in East Africa are Amanda and Owen. Their present habitat, the Ngorongoro Crater, has been affected by a lot of rain. They had to invest in an expensive piece of equipment to help them when their vehicles get stuck in the mud. Their partnership has created some of TV's finest wildlife films.

They travel all over the world to film exotic wildlife. They have been filming animals for many years. They have learned to set aside four months on location to gather sufficient material for each half-hour film. Before they get the green light, they have to submit a script for approval.

It can be a rough existence, but the appeal of being alone in such remote areas is that they can get close enough to the animals to become part of their lives.<eos>"

Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies chemical processes happening in the sea. She teaches and does research into marine geochemistry at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she dives down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

A dive can last for 16 hours. If there is a problem, you can hit a panic button and the escape vessel will be released. It's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching and she uses her salary to fund her research into underwater volcanoes.

Young shoppers often go to the supermarket with their parents. Sometimes, they want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, all three. Parents often have a hard time managing their children's shopping demands. They feel guilty about buying and feeding their children rubbish. And they get cross and defensive in anticipation as they leave home.

Research has found that children make a purchase request every two minutes when they are taken to the supermarket. A lot of money is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. Parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy. But these ideas are not always accurate.

Parents also admit they are inconsistent and hypocritical in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Sometimes, they refuse to buy their children sweets because they know it's bad for them, but they buy double cream and chocolate for themselves. It's hard to be consistent.

Supermarkets could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas.<eos>"

Ice skating has a long history. People have been skating for thousands of years. In the past, skates were made from animal bones. Now, skates are made from metal. In the early days, skating was a stylish and reserved activity. But at the 1924 Winter Olympics, a young girl named Sonja Henie introduced a new way of skating that made it more popular. Today, skating is both graceful and physically demanding. To learn to skate, you need to focus on balance, control, and relaxation. You also need to learn how to fall safely. Once you have mastered the basics, you can practice different styles of skating. If you want to improve your skating skills, you should practice regularly.

Chris Greener was tall when he was young. He is the tallest man in Britain. Every year, more and more people are born who are tall. This does not mean that humanity is producing a new super race. We are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods, including fruits, berries, and herbs. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented. This has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Most people today eat a diet that is based on three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet has led to a number of health problems, including tooth decay and diseases. However, there is a trend towards healthier diets in Europe, the US, and Japan. As a result, the average man in these countries is now taller than he was in the past. However, there are some problems with this trend. For example, leg-room in planes and trains has shrunk, and clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it?<eos>"

Studio audiences are a common feature of television life. They are made up of people from all classes, professions and income groups. People often go to studio audiences to appear on television, take a look behind the scenes, or simply have fun.

When you sit in a studio audience, you are squashed among strangers and someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them. You clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means.

Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.<eos>"

That was his first attempt at travel writing.

Sophia loves a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. She always travels first class. The scenery is not spectacular. But there is one point on the journey that she always looks forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. She sees herself in the eyes of the people who live in the villages.

Matthew likes the Hartland Peninsula. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks. He prefers to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys.

Annette's favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It's a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and she likes the feeling of space.

In our fast-paced world, letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe there is something special about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication.

I have been writing letters since I was young. I remember writing to my mother and my friends. It was always a joy to receive letters from home. They contained everyday events and news. I also wrote letters to my boyfriends. It helped me to stay in touch and improve my writing skills.

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged rapidly. The drawings include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti.

The drawings are being damaged by people stamping on them, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors even chop off parts of the drawings to take home as souvenirs. Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings,or even their names, in the rocks.

Experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Some believe that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Others believe that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but to charge a fee or rope off the area and provide guides.<eos>"

Going up the wall was once a challenge that climbers used to do in the mountains. Now, it can be done anywhere, indoors or out. The crowd holds its breath as a climber hangs upside down from the tips of two fingers on a climbing wall. The climber, Francois Lombard, is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. The National Indoor Arena is famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but it also hosts the World Cup Climbing Championships. The fact that either event is possible is due to a new and rapidly developing technology. Until the mid-1960s, climbers practised their skills on cliffs. However, as the sport developed, it became increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. Many sports centres started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education, who constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University.<eos>"

Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the village. They had to be carefully selected for the area.

Tabloid newspapers often publish pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures can be very damaging to individuals in the public eye. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to individuals when their private moments are captured on the front page. Very few people call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to deal with this issue. The PCC should investigate these pictures and take action against the newspapers that published them. It would be a great idea to have the PCC take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks. However, there are some problems with this idea. It would be difficult to decide whether or not to launch an inquiry, and celebrities and members of royalty might not be happy if their stories were taken up. Additionally, the role itself is too enormous and there is the embarrassment factor to consider. It is hard to see an easy solution to this serious problem.<eos>"

First, you need to ask yourself what you want to achieve in the long term. Do you want to specialize in a particular field, work your way up to higher levels of responsibility, or out of your current employment into a broader field? Once you have decided what you want, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious career planning and give you increasing responsibility. If you have the travel bug, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then.

A Jenny said that when she left school, she was very shy and thought she would always stay that way. But she surprised herself by doing well and someone suggested that she should do a university course.

B Michaela said that to be confident, you have to believe in yourself. If things get too demanding for her at work, she doesn't let herself feel guilty if she saves a number of tasks until the next day.

C Lisa said that the calmer she looks, the more terrified she really is. She has had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV.

D Barbara said that her confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work she does. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round.

Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for something else. A five-pound note can buy a book, a lot of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, people exchanged things that they had. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. In time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. Today, everyone uses a national currency.<eos>"

After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria where she began teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have any copies of her books, but we know that she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work.

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are many different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.<eos>"

The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin to Adelaide in Australia. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent and is often called the 'famous Ghan'. It is not a high-speed train and there are few stops. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train would save time and money.

As I waited to board the Ghan, I could see that everyone was really looking forward to the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up the majority of my fellow travellers, were particularly keen to board. Our first stop was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged nowadays and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset.<eos>"

Climbing to the top of Britain each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. The weather can be very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis. It was his first big winter climb. The route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's a long climb - probably the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up. They carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for their boots. The track was steep and there was a lot of snow. It was hard to walk on. The climber had to rest more frequently. After a long climb, they reached the top. They could see the sea and the island of Skye. However, the weather was not perfect. A mist had come down. Getting back down to camp can be just as challenging as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly. The climber was glad they had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when he was safe in the tent that he could say he really enjoyed the experience.<eos>"

It took a long time to build, so I saw all of it happening. There are five classrooms, which are much bigger than in my previous school. We also have a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms. The school is well designed to hold all the heat and sound inside, so we can sing inside our classrooms like we're in a concert hall. There's also a tree on the roof of the school. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it.

He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it.

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in the ocean. They have excellent eyesight and can also feel movement through special lines on their bodies. These abilities make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. Sharks are different from other fish in a number of ways. For example, unlike other fish, sharks need to swim constantly in order to breathe and stay alive. They hardly sleep at all. If sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This technique is very useful for researchers who often need to handle sharks. It allows them to learn more about these fascinating creatures.<eos>"

The Arctic is a popular destination in the summer, but in the winter, it is cold and dark. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, the guests were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, the ice hotel is world famous.

The ice hotel is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season. As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed.

If you are planning to come to the ice hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in.<eos>"

In 2003, Tanya made history by being the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath. She had been deeper before, but this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man.

Tanya spends a lot of time training for her dives. She does a lot of land-based training at the gym, and she also spends time in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart, but she doesn't run because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness.

When Tanya is not training, she makes frequent public appearances to advertise sports products and to support environmental organisations.

But soon afterwards, some directors had new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could enjoy. Not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.<eos>"

In the past, shoes were not very important. They were probably made of animal skin and were used to keep people warm during cold weather. Today, we still use leather, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular. It was only a few hundred years ago that people began to wear different shoes on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, most shoes are made in large factories using machines. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.<eos>"

In the 1880s, there was a lot of gold discovered in Alaska, USA. Many people went to the area to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One town was called Iditarod. It grew so quickly that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the winter, the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to the towns. So, in 1910, a winter track was built. It was used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at roadhouses where the drivers could get a warm bed and something to eat.

The Iditarod Trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the closest medicine was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead. The journey covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey.<eos>"

But still, many people go there every year to visit what is probably Europe's most unusual accommodation. In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made of ice. You can also get married in one of the ice rooms. The bar is also made of ice, and it is not recommended to put hot drinks on it. The bedrooms are very cold, but guests are provided with special sleeping bags that will keep them warm in the coldest of temperatures. The hotel is only open for six months a year because it melts in the summer, and each winter it is rebuilt. Creating the hotel takes a lot of ice and snow.<eos>"

Maria Mutola was playing football in a local competition in Mozambique in 1988. She won the competition and no one thought it was a problem that she was a girl. But then, the team that they beat complained. The story was published in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, read about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realised that she was fast. He talked to Maria about athletics and bought her running shoes and took her training. It was hard work and Maria's legs really ached. But Jose visited Maria's parents and persuaded them that she could be successful. They agreed to let him take her away to train. In 1991, Maria finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. Today, Maria still runs and lives happily in South Africa with her mother.<eos>"

The Grand Canyon in the United States was created by the River Colorado. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to go walking and running, but mainly to look at the view. It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The Skywalk is a platform whose walls and floor are made of glass. You can see the beautiful rocks of the canyon from the Skywalk. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007 and since then thousands of people have used it. To use the Skywalk, you have to wear special covers over your shoes to avoid scratching the glass. Walking onto the Skywalk makes you feel like a bird flying high up in the air.<eos>"

The Rocky Mountains are tall mountains that run across North America. They start in the northwest and lie close to the centre of the continent in the south. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are still impressive. There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, a city that is known for its beautiful scenery and friendly people. You can ski on slopes just 15 minutes from the city centre. There are three passenger trains a week that run from Vancouver to the rest of North America. The ride is still a great adventure. You sleep on board, which is fun, but travel through some of the best scenery at night.<eos>"

People began to keep animals in zoos a long time ago. In ancient China, there was a big zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the early zoos, animals were sometimes taught to perform for the visitors. Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everybody agrees with zoos. Some people think that zoos are a good idea because they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals. Others disapprove of zoos because they believe it is wrong to put animals in cages. If zoos are not managed properly, animals live in dirty conditions and eat unsuitable food.<eos>"

My name is Katie Atkins, and I'm 14 years old. I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! Each band had its own costumes, like black school uniforms or brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing. We also created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch - but even better when my band played on stage. We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country - I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you.<eos>"

Marrakesh, Morocco, is a city that receives a lot of rain between November and March. Although it doesn't happen often, when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods. As a result, the streets turn into rivers. However, the locals welcome the rain because it helps their parks and gardens. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist thanks to a network of underground channels that bring in water from the mountains all year round. These channels were dug in the 11th century. Places that receive their water in this way are called oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here, every available piece of land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food.<eos>"

Little Chefs is a cooking course for children aged between ten and fifteen. It's very popular, with a waiting list of 30 children. Parents pay PS280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.

Bill, aged ten, loves his mum's cooking and now he can do it better than her. Flora, twelve, loves cooking too. She did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. She was happy staying at home, so she wasn't too keen at first. But she's glad she decided to come.

Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking. As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''<eos>"

Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. He found the drawing classes difficult, but he still kept on painting. In his late twenties, he was given money by the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to put this light into his paintings. He painted colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished.<eos>"

Two years ago, Ben, a 14-year-old, asked his parents for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, his parents were not sure because of the noise. But Ben argued that playing drums is better than watching television or playing computer games. In the end, his parents gave in.

Because drums are not easy to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at Ben's parents' home with their instruments. For several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their singing.

Ben's hobby has been good for his parents' health. Whenever the band starts practising, his parents go out for a long walk. And although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men.

The main worry is that Ben's musical activities might distract him from his school work. But so far, this hasn't happened. Ben's parents are always stressing to him how important his studies are.<eos>"

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, a private college in Wales. It's a very good college that gives young people the opportunity to learn and gain experience outside the classroom. The students, who are between 16 and 18 years old, come from all over the world. They spend their mornings studying and their afternoons doing activities like helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers. One of the best things about Atlantic College is that the students come from many different countries. As few can afford the fees, grants are available. Many students are British and receive government help. ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like."" To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.<eos>"

I am 32 years old and I have just finished my first year at university. I decided to go to university after many years away from school. I was working as a secretary, but I was bored and unhappy. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in a job that I didn't like. I was jealous of the students at the university, who looked happy and carefree. However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. They always mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel separated from the lecturers because, although we are the same age, I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying.<eos>"

After driving it for a long distance, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model T, which sold for $825. He was soon selling a lot of cars. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth a lot of money. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.<eos>"

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she climbed the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. You must carry everything on your back, so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink. When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television. Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains.<eos>"

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. They live in Canada. In the autumn, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are very cold in Canada and the birds die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found some young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them. When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him.<eos>"

Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had a lot of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines.

Most house burglaries happen in the afternoon, between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. A lot of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to close a door or a window. Night-time burglaries are not very common because families are usually at home at that time. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. To keep burglars away, it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. You should also ask your neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when you are away. If you see anything strange, you should call the police.<eos>"

In the past, people used to gather plants and fruit from the forest to eat. They had to move around a lot to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, people started to grow food in the Middle East. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it easier for people to stay in one place and their villages grew bigger. Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and sometimes people did not get enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.<eos>"

Bollywood, which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes a lot of films. It makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.<eos>"

Howard Bonnier is a young Englishman who lives in a village called Bray, which is about fifty kilometres west of London. He opened a restaurant called The Palace there a few months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written about all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He liked doing this so much that he decided to use his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.<eos>"

Line dancing is a popular hobby in Britain. There are clubs and classes for line dancing in almost every town. It is easy to learn if you have two feet and can walk. You don't need a partner because you dance in groups. It's the best way to make new friends. In my classes, there are young and old people. The boys like it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet during the dances. Line dancing began about fifteen years ago when American country music became famous in Britain.<eos>"

In London in the 18th century, there were no policemen. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night. About 300 years ago, London was growing bigger and dirtier. There were a lot of thieves who stole money in the streets. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners'. Later, London became even bigger and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are well paid.<eos>"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you reach Lake Nipissing. In the winter, the lake turns into ice, and many Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years.

You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First you break the ice and make a small hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bait on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bait. They are small, between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack. Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here.<eos>"

The bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. It was invented about one hundred and fifty years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could afford to buy one. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought one. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles. But some people still prefer to cycle to work. They say that there are too many cars in town centres and you can't find anywhere to park.<eos>"

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. We went to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens. We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Elephants used to work in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.<eos>"

There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. They can be up to 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot. Lions are the only cats that stay together in large family groups. Several lions may work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. All cats need good eyes, because they catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast, and very strong.<eos>"

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. It can be more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa. There are not very many of them left. Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour. It is very difficult for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.<eos>"

I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.""

Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim at more than 10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. In the past, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was dirty and there was not much food for them.

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We also build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.<eos>"
