Garbage collection is a ritual that is similar in many developed countries. In most places, it is free to dispose of rubbish. However, if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. To reduce the amount of rubbish that is produced, people need to be charged for disposing of their waste. This will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more.
When a town starts charging for rubbish disposal, the number of bags or cans that are collected usually decreases. However, this is often due to the 'Seattle stomp', which is when people cram more garbage into each container. This can be done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals.
In addition to the reduction in the number of bags or cans that are collected, there is also an increase in the weight of materials recycled. This is because people are more likely to recycle if they have to pay to dispose of their rubbish."

Work can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, but it can also be stressful and unsatisfying. To be successful in your career, you need to be able to communicate effectively, be creative and imaginative, and be able to work well with others. If you are not able to do these things, no amount of money or status will be able to compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
There are a number of things that can make work more fulfilling. One is to find a job that you are passionate about. Another is to be able to work in a supportive and collaborative environment. If you are able to do both of these things, you will be much more likely to be successful in your career.
However, there are also a number of challenges that can make work difficult. One is stress. Another is the feeling of being unappreciated or undervalued. If you are experiencing these challenges, it is important to find ways to cope. There are many things that you can do to reduce stress and improve your overall well-being."

Broadcasting is a technology that was originally used to sow seeds broadly. It is also a metaphor for optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth and the production of a rich harvest.
The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, which means that there are centralised resources intended for spreading and reproduction.
Since television is related to various two-way forms of communication, it is striking that it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies.
In the early 1930s, there were attempts to experiment with other forms of organisation. But these attempts remained just that - attempts and experiments.
Television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s. And as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry."

Sometimes it feels like having a lot of possessions doesn't make you feel secure. It's reasonable to want to have a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there's a point where the desire to acquire things gets out of control. Advertising can be very persuasive, and it can make you feel like you need to buy things you don't have. To see how much you are influenced, I challenge you to not read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street.
Caves are a mysterious part of the natural environment. They have been studied for many years, and there is a lot of research about them. Caves are also important because they have a long history of study. However, exploring caves can be physically demanding, so cave research has been less in the hands of learned professors than other scientific fields.
Meteorology is the study of weather. Countless people have laid the foundations of meteorology, and it has progressed into a highly technical science. Satellites and electronic instruments provide us with a lot of weather information, and computers can solve complex mathematical problems quickly. However, human experience is still the most important part of meteorology. It is the human observations that translate computed data into weather forecasts."

Music and theatre are two different art forms. Opera is primarily a theatre performance, but the music comes first. The music is the heart of opera. At a musical performance, there will usually be people who don't understand the technical or academic aspects of music. However, most people are impressed by the skill of the performers. Music and theatre audiences have different expectations. Theatre audiences expect to understand the nature of an actor's skill and be awed by the activity. Music audiences expect to be able to appreciate the beauty and skill of the performers. There are some things that could be done to change the conventions of music-going. For example, music audiences could be more patient and allow the performers to complete their performance without interrupting. They could also be more willing to try new and unfamiliar music."

Sand is a nuisance when it is in its natural state. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and sticks to you. When you are wet, it adheres to you like 'stucco'. But, when you step onto a beach towel or climb into a car, it pours off you. Sand can stay with you for a long time. It is a nuisance to keep sand away.
A lock and key are used to keep people out of a place. They have been used for a long time. People like locks and keys because they make them feel safe. Some new locking systems use computer cards to control locks. But people don't like them. They prefer to use a physical key.

Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film usually involves reducing, condensing and deleting text. This can be frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. When I was working on a script, I realized that I could dispense with a lot of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene, while still getting across the same point.
The studio where I was working was a complex place. It was made up of many different buildings, and it was difficult to find your way around. But the studio lacked a focus. It would have been much better if there had been a single main entrance.

In those days, the council houses in West Earlham stretched all over the city. They were row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings. In the summer, the chemicals from the factory came and hung around the doors and gardens with a smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path. Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting on a vantage point near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on, there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. My mother was a small, precise and nearly always angry woman. She was the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that your mother liked. It was a lot of rules. But my mother was determined to teach me to follow them."

Charles Darwin thought that humans have a natural tendency to cry. It is not clear why we cry, but there are a few possible reasons. One reason is that crying can help us to connect with others. It can also be used to express sympathy or sadness. Sometimes, we cry involuntarily when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sentimental film. However, the most important reason for crying is its social function. Tears can help us to build trust and social connectedness."

The Earth is getting warmer and this is causing a lot of changes to the planet. The changes are affecting plants, animals, water and soils. Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, but any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously.
One of the biggest problems is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system. Despite this, most people agree that the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced.
The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. Some of the changes that are already happening include changes in precipitation patterns, changes in the timing of seasons, and changes in the distribution of plants and animals.
The future effects of climate change are predicted to be even more severe. Some of the predicted effects include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and changes to glacial processes.
The consequences of climate change are potentially devastating. They could include increased flooding and inundation, loss of homes and livelihoods, and mass displacement of people."

Art is a powerful form of human expression that involves the creation and appreciation of aesthetic objects. These objects exist physically and are often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in which they are housed. However, the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience. When artistic objects are separated from their original context and operation, they become isolated and difficult to understand. To understand the meaning of artistic products, we must forget them for a time and turn aside from them to have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts."

Lions are powerful animals that live in Africa. They are often seen hunting for food. When lions hunt, they work together as a group. They are very successful at catching their prey.
But lions are not always successful. Sometimes, they spend too much time trying to catch their prey and not enough time protecting their cubs. If an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense.
Researchers have studied lions for many years. They have learned that lions are not always the best at making decisions. Sometimes, they make decisions that are not in their best interest.

The early 1990s were a tough time for advertising professionals. There was a recession in business that was longer, deeper and more severe than anyone could have predicted. It affected every single business in the country, including advertising agencies. Many people lost their jobs and homes, and the economy was in a bad state.
However, despite the challenges, the advertising industry continued to grow. Companies started to realize that they needed to make sure their advertising was effective. They wanted to get better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better media placement.
The recession also made it difficult to produce effective advertising. There was a lot of controversy over production costs, and people were reluctant to take risks. As a result, many advertising professionals had to revisit Lord Leverhulme's commonplace that only half of their advertising works.
The situation is currently very difficult for advertising professionals. There is a lot of pressure on them to increase the proportion of advertising that works. Help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available."

Summer promises us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. Books can help us to feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match.
We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about."

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon that has developed thanks to the growth of capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Fashion has a long history, and it has become more complex and significant as societies have developed and technology has improved. Today, it is difficult to say exactly what any item of clothing or adornment means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people in different contexts. Writing can be a way to make ends meet, but it is not always easy to get published. To write a novel, you need to be patient and persistent.

Music has had a significant impact on our lives in many ways. In the past, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians. However, there has also been a widening access to music through technology. Music is often used in major state occasions and provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal. It is also beneficial to the development of skills such as spatial reasoning, social relationships, concentration and focused study habits.
There are a few challenges facing the music profession in the future. One challenge is the need to adapt to the changing landscape of music listening and making. Another challenge is the need to provide more opportunities for people to learn to play instruments. Finally, the music profession needs to work together to raise the profile of music and ensure that it is valued more in society."

The craft of acting can be seen as a derision or contempt by some people. This is often fueled by actors themselves when they are compelled to talk about their craft in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' Instead, they often fall into ponderous cliches, silly truisms, or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine.
A review of Hamlet Adrian Lester's Hamlet is poised precariously between boyhood and manhood. His handling of the text and his physical and psychological self-control take him, in one leap, from brilliantly promising to frontline player: an actor with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing.
What is acting? What is behaviour? Is the former an imitation or an evocation of the latter? That is the central question about the life of the theatre. One director's approach to rehearsal is known as 'dropping in'. This procedure goes something like this. The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking. When it is their turn to speak, they glance off the screen, digest the first phrase, think about what it means to them, wait to find the impulse - the reason to speak - then speak.
The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. It's important that the theatre itself creates a relationship between the performer and the audience.

Photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity for over a century. It has allowed us to see the fleeting moment and visualize both the vast and the minuscule. Photography has also brought us images from remote areas of the world and distant parts of the solar system. It has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
The earliest creations of pictorial recording go back as far as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. Pictures seem to be inextricably linked to human culture. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised about the accuracy and status of the visual image.

Writing poetry is like playing a game. You need to be spontaneous and creative, but also be aware of the potential risks. If you try to be too perfect, you might end up ruining your work.

I have never started a novel with more worry. If I call it a novel, it is because I don't know what else to call it. I have a story to tell, but I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my memories of a man I knew well, but I have little knowledge of what happened to him between the times I saw him. I could fill in the gaps, but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know. To save embarrassment to people still living, I have changed the names of the people in the story. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end, he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature."

Oral History
The trend of historians using oral evidence has its challenges. It is not always true that someone's testimony is a pure reflection of the past. In an interview, each person is affected by the other person. The historian chooses the informant and decides what to talk about. Even if the historian does not ask any questions and simply listens, the presence of an outsider changes the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past. The end product is influenced by both the historian's social position and the terms in which he or she has learned to analyze the past. To be a good historian, you must accept responsibility for your part in creating new evidence.
Animal Science
There are two main approaches to studying animals. The physiological approach focuses on how the body works. The whole animal approach studies the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it. Within the whole animal approach, there are two main types of study: psychology and ethology. Psychologists study learning abilities in a restricted range of species. Ethologists study naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals. Although there is some overlap, the two approaches are distinct. To understand animal behaviour, you need to study it at both a physiological and a behavioural level.
The Social Sciences
Studying a social science for the first time can be challenging. You must learn the substance of the subject and the methodology. This means becoming familiar with the knowledge and research findings in the textbooks and the methods used to obtain and organize that knowledge. The two elements are closely related. Although common sense may seem to apply to social life, each social science discipline goes beyond common sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life and uses its own set of concepts. To understand social science, you need to learn the basic ideas in the subject.

Classical architecture was more than just the construction of buildings. It was an art form. Vitruvius, a Roman architect, said that architecture consists of order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. These concepts are based on earlier Greek authority.

They decided to go on a journey together. They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. They left early in the morning and returned by midday. Lily drove impeccably. She overtook a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve. Chen went as far as applauding.
They parked in a small street off the sea front. Lily was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings. She preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away.

I had read somewhere that if you dig a deep hole, you can see the stars. I had invited you to help me with my plan. I climbed down the well and fell into it. I cracked my head and was dazed. I saw lights that were strange and inchoate. I was frightened and relieved. I was angry at you for letting me fall and afraid of what Mother would say. I called out for help, but nobody heard me. I lay still, waiting for help. Finally, I was pulled out of the well. I was tired and scared. I ran away from the well and hid in the shadows. My mother and father came to see me. They were worried about me. I felt ashamed of myself. I knew that I had done something wrong. I apologized to my parents, but they were not happy. They said that I was being ridiculous. They walked away. I was alone and sad. I felt like I had lost everything."

The internet opened up a new way for people to share their opinions about books. A popular online bookstore called Amazon allowed anyone to write a review of a book. This made it easy for people to see what others thought of a book. The reviews on Amazon were free and uncensored, which meant that anyone could say what they wanted about a book. However, there were some problems with the reviews. For example, some people wrote fake reviews to promote their own books. And, some people wrote reviews that were too long or too short. Despite these problems, the reviews on Amazon were still a valuable tool for readers. They provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular book was worth buying."

Art has changed a lot in the last two hundred years. In the past, art was praised for being unique and revolutionary. Today, we often get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far. We expect artists to be separate from the rest of us and to have special talents and drive.
There is a new situation that I want to talk about. An artist chooses a piece of text and asks someone to write it on a canvas. The finished product is a painting. But the problem is that the art-buying public often expects artists to stick to one genre. If an artist tries to do something new, they are often met with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.
I have escaped to this island with a few books. I am quite alone. I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side."

Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake. It was a possession which could only be afforded by exercising stringent and calculated economy. At the time, it had seemed like a sensible and desirable move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand.
The house wasn't really suitable for a family, and they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. The overcrowded tube journey had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, and the smell of dinner from the kitchen.
The job was important to Lois and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia."

Language is a mysterious and fascinating subject. It is difficult to understand the origin of language and how it has evolved over time. However, recent research has shed light on this topic.

Writing reviews is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to write a short review for a newspaper, and quite another to write a long review for an international journal or a magazine. The reviewer needs to think about the probable audience, the length of the review, and the subject matter. They also need to know quite a bit about quite a number of things and be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy.
However, reviewing is not a primary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough."

Ralph unlocked the door to his flat and as he entered the dark, he felt a sense of ownership. When he first bought the flat, he used to come home feeling happy and relaxed.

There was a small puddle of letters and a red eye of the answering machine that sometimes gathered by the door. And he was grateful that the glassy eyes of his windows hadn't been smashed.

If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed very quickly, while others take much longer. Some can be speeded up, but others cannot. If you try to rush a task, it will probably break down.

I have been welcomed warmly to this foreign land. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote place. There are a lot of people living there, mostly scientists, students, and weathermen. My school French is good enough to communicate, but not to chat or have fun. I miss the subtleties, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. There is no problem for me in this, but there was a problem of self-confidence. I felt a little nervous at mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose and the silence that fell when I spoke. I still smile stupidly, or panic when people talk to me. I think the cause of this occasional depression is because I've lost the social confidence which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Amateur Astronomy
Many things have changed in astronomy over the past fifty years. In the past, there were few charts and catalogues, and telescopic equipment was limited. Today, there are many more charts and catalogues, and telescopes are more accessible. Computers have made it easier to produce charts and analyze observations. All this makes this a good time for amateur astronomy.
However, there has also been a loss of things. The skies are now polluted by aircraft condensation trails, which can make it difficult to see stars. The daytime skies are also plagued by these trails, which can make it difficult to see the sun.

Othello, a play by Shakespeare, was recently transferred to London from Stratford. The production is exceptional and allows me to make amends for an unfair review I wrote last spring.

However, I appreciate Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. The whole cast is magnificent, and there are many memorable scenes in the play.

Writing and Reading
Dr Johnson believed that writing without effort is generally read without pleasure. Good writing comes hard. Looking back at my handwritten school essays, I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. The reason was that they were physically hard to write. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. What would be difficult to alter or erase was written with care.

Reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most never do it. The organisation of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text.

In England, breakfast is a relatively new tradition. It is not often described in medieval literature. There are some references to people having a meal at dawn or for medicinal reasons, but most people did not have breakfast unless they were royalty or wealthy. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast became more common. This is probably because there was more food available. Also, new patterns of employment may have influenced the importance of breakfast. Many people started working very early, so they needed to have a meal first thing in the morning. Therefore, breakfast became more important for practical reasons than for social reasons."

Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. Birds have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people used to read the directions in which wrens flew to determine their luck. Today, the image of the wren is still in pictures and ceramics in many British households.
Birds are also important to us because they are indicators of environmental change. Conservationists in Britain cite the endangering of 30 species, which is a big loss of cultural heritage. Folklore is important because it can help us to understand and appreciate birds. The stories, legends and rhymes which persist through time can summon up feelings and attitudes from a consciousness buried under all the stuff of modern life."

A map is used to show the relationships between points and features on the Earth's surface. It is determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in units of time, but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than about actual distance. Direction is also an important element of a map. The traveller's main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', so accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Early maps were often rivalled by written itineraries. Today, certain types of maps, such as those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs, realistic or conventional, and varied in size to indicate their importance. The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which distance and direction are determined and the comprehensiveness of the map content. Today, cartography is used in many sciences, such as geology, history, and geography. It is also used to show distributions of various things, such as geological strata and climatic regimes."

Language is a powerful tool that humans have. We can use language to communicate with each other and ourselves. It is such an instinctive skill that people know how to talk like spiders know how to spin webs. Climate and weather are also powerful forces that affect the lives of animals and plants. They can be a dominating force on the character of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are natural treasure troves. Cold, windswept areas can only muster a scattered selection of living things. The daily weather patterns that add up in the long term to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing. Some of the motion is due to the fact that the air rests on a spinning globe. A more important source of turbulence, or air movement, however, is the sun.

Art on TV is not very successful at showing paintings and sculptures. It could be because the camera does not always have the ability to show the details of a work of art.

A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight-part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust. He has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
