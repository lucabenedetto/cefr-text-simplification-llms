CPE_15,C2,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy, but it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common practice. Rubbish bags or bins are regularly collected by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this process strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces little. However, disposing of rubbish is not free. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities have to pay more for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to charge households for the waste they produce. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming there are places to recycle. 
However, American economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per bag, the number of bags fell by 37%. But this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a method known as the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs, only fell by 14%. In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying, which might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 
One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, as people chose to recycle for free rather than pay for rubbish collection. However, this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling voluntarily. In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is lower than other studies, but not surprising. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In wealthier towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 
Should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and the results are not always pleasant."
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Today, just being successful in your career isn't enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous people often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to consider how your work affects you personally, including your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your job makes you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then status or money won't make up for your lack as a person.
I am exploring how work can focus on fulfilling personal aspirations, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also offer a meaningful lifestyle, help discover hidden talents, and provide diverse human interactions. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment is the only goal. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.
Even traditional middle-class jobs are losing their appeal. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Companies and public institutions are downsizing, and strategies like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's.
I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and create courage. Now, I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts work on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs because we see no other choice?
Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is more than a place to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations where people from around the world meet but often don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they have limited interaction with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the skills of the students they employ, rather than just giving them basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's ambitions, they would see many new services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit this by focusing on profit.
It's time to rethink what work means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. Work is a relationship. As people seek independence and personal expression at work, they should have the chance to design their jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical and profitable limits. This requires communicating beyond professional jargon and engaging in meaningful conversations. True conversation is more than just communication; it's an intimate exchange that creates respect and can change participants. It's not just relaxing; it's a way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"Broadcasting originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand, like in farming. This idea of broadcasting is not just about farming; it also represents the hope of modern times. It suggests planned growth and a rich outcome if conditions are right. The idea assumes there is a central source of seeds, or information, ready to be spread. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fit this farming metaphor.
Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. But from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. Sending broadcasts from a central place to private homes matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of organising television were tried but remained just experiments.
Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Magazines like Radio News published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. This ended the chance for television to develop as a grassroots, equal form of communication in Britain.
Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the deep structures of modern societies. In the USA in the early 1930s, television was mainly a medium for public viewing, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people first experienced television. Although the idea of grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems in several countries in the 1930s posed a potential challenge to the home-based model of television. But this challenge did not last.
Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. With the division between public and private life in modern society, centralised broadcasting to homes was the most suitable way to organise television. As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as a centre for entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.
There is a link between social modernisation and the main structures of broadcasting. As societies modernised, they became more centralised, with concentrated capital and political power. Traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which left them more isolated than in stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of national community.
Broadcasting became the dominant form of radio and television because of these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is changing, and the term broadcasting might become outdated. If that happens, the metaphor of broadcasting will be seen as describing a specific way of organising audio-visual technology during a certain phase of social modernisation."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. It often suggests that if you don't have a certain product, you are not as good as others. To see how much ads affect you, try not to read any billboards next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us even noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on how they form, their water systems, and their living organisms. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire to learn more. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves have impacted human life, studies have been even more intense. However, exploring caves often requires physical skill, so cave research is not just done by professors. There is a unique overlap between professional scientists and amateur cave explorers who study caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has become a highly technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses many long words that can be confusing to non-experts. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still crucial for turning computer data into weather forecasts. Human observations can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is primarily about music, with theatre coming second. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.
At musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about what they don't know, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect string section is easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics match. We know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when running for a bus, but they do it much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't particularly impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences. In fact, many people attend both. However, in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play or spectacular the event.
The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion, humor, sadness, intimacy, and grandeur. It can go wrong unexpectedly and engages the listener's imagination as part of a group. However, the formal traditions in music, like strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists, highlight the difference between performers and listeners, which can feel hierarchical.
On the other hand, modern music audiences sometimes interrupt performances by clapping between movements or after a great solo. While this shows appreciation, it can disrupt the flow of the music. Can anything be done? Yes, a lot is being done. There are efforts to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a top-quality musical experience, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.
What I hope for in music is more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations, which change normal expectations. This can have surprising effects on both performers and audiences. Comforts might be sacrificed, the sound might not be perfect, or it might be a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous and follow artists into unexpected spaces. I know most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe something should change in music conventions. My only authority is as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
While I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly an annoying obstacle between the car park at the beach and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, sand sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong water spray. But strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off you. For days, you keep finding sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand flies around when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. No, I don't like sand at all.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security since they first started building houses. The simple wooden bar behind the door has been replaced by electronic locks that use a plastic card with countless combinations. But the desire to keep out intruders is still the same. Locks and keys are partly about feeling secure. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locks, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't really like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of turning a real key in a lock. So, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in it.
**Modern Art**  
I was worried about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I don't really understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially things with fur, neon light sculptures, and large photos. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to analyze it like a school essay. The idea is to let art speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, real labels that explain the context of the art and what it's trying to say. Instead of just staring at the pictures without understanding, these bits of information helped me get it."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
When adapting novels into films, a lot of the original content is often reduced or removed. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and description in a novel can be cut without losing the main point. This doesn't mean the original content was unnecessary. It's about how each medium—books and films—engages the audience differently and uses repetition in its own way. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In stage plays, dialogue often mimics real speech, sometimes using a lot of unnecessary words just to keep the conversation going, which can make it hard to understand what's really being communicated.
**Watching Movies**
Watching movies can be an immersive experience, making you feel part of the film's world. During the movie, you escape from reality, but once the film ends, you're back to the real world. In the past, movies were seen as just entertainment, not art. Many people, including our parents and teachers, thought movies were not serious art, even though they enjoyed watching them.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing mix of different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many similar rooms and no clear main entrance. There were three entrances, but only one led to where you wanted to go. Visitors were rare because the studio didn't encourage them, but employees knew their way around. Together, they created films that offered audiences a break from everyday life, providing romance and adventure.
**Film-makers**
Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are full of guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his low-budget film El Mariachi, which launched his career. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his breakthrough film by age 23. In the past, filmmakers took longer to succeed. They gained experience working in different roles before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without studio support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of cramped, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong sulfur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. 
Most of my early life is a blur, but I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, I have vague memories of faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of a mansion at Earlham. My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that her personality was unusual. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as she was on a moor. 
She also had a strict sense of propriety, which was rare on the West Earlham estate. This sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly.' As a moral code, it was beyond my understanding, and even now, I'm not sure I get it. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules and restrictions.
Over time, other people appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. Later, I realized that this group was not great company. They were a sad and depressing group, talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up and free myself from it. This was easier said than done.
Growing up in West Earlham at that time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat. As far as I remember, my mother let other children in the street take care of me on this journey.
If I remember anything about those early years, it's the summer holidays, when you got glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and a charity fete once at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were 'only after your money.' My mother often talked about people having selfish motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, it was as a place where rich people opened letters full of money sent by a gullible public. I might be exaggerating, and I might overlook her good qualities and focus on her flaws. But my mother didn't have much kindness; it seemed to have been taken from her.
To be fair, my mother did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes,' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't completely against this activity and eventually almost had opinions on the art. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick and humid, turning into a light, prickly rain. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well since I was a child. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, all girls, lived in the houses of the Krings and the Pottses. Even though I didn't know everyone by name, each house was unique to me, just like the small channels in the cement that guided rain from the roofs to the street. These channels were important landmarks when I was on my roller skates or scooter. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get smaller and the front yards became tiny. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron, giving a Southern or Spanish look. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, turned back into homes. I wondered how people lived in these spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space because it was hard to separate work from home life. In his previous place, the living and working areas were combined, making it difficult to relax or focus on work. So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and directs attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. Gilbert wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could either cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental furniture from his parents or bought from markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and mysteries, making his adventurous lifestyle a topic of literary debate. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It combined the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and deep insights. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction, changing details to make stories more interesting. His book suggested that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain in 1996, I hurried across my lawn and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I watched raindrops create small fountains that turned into bubbles and burst. The best moments were when the storm got stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was then that I thought about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain's path to the sea, breaking free from the routine of swimming laps. In our world, many places and things are clearly marked and explained, which can make reality feel like just a visual experience. Activities like walking, cycling, and swimming help us reconnect with the wild and mysterious parts of the world by going off the beaten path. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying had no clear purpose in evolution. He was probably wrong. More recent scientists have shown its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps create a bond between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its exact consequences are unclear. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have used these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support six billion people. Any changes to these resources are serious.
The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These gases are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes the future uncertain. We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed along with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.
A lot of research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they simplify the real world and have limitations. Their predictions are only estimates, and they are costly and slow to run. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know they are complex.
Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we've seen before. GCMs help us understand what the world might be like in the future. They predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, may become more common in some areas. These forecasts show the potential impact of climate change on nature and humans.
Climate changes could affect where ecosystems like forests and grasslands are located, the species they contain, and their ability to provide benefits that societies rely on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects might be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts could be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952 due to fewer frosts.
However, many predicted effects of future warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, either by long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to start in dry regions and areas with existing water shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed, with more rain in autumn and winter and less in spring.
Another concern is changes to glaciers, which will affect ice and, in turn, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing iceberg risks. The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face significant disruptions, and many people might lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, as they might disappear entirely, causing devastating impacts on their people and culture, and creating challenges for countries that would need to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This is the type of people needed for the first mission to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a spacecraft on 5 January 2018 succeed. The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next chance to launch, when Mars and Earth are in the right positions, won't be until 2031. It's a big challenge, and the race is on to create systems with completely new technologies. If these can be developed quickly enough, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never launches, the work to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as it will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**Aesthetics**
Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art is what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can hinder our understanding of art.
Moreover, when art becomes highly admired and gains a classic status, it can become disconnected from the human experiences and conditions that created it. This separation makes it difficult to grasp the broader significance of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often placed in a separate realm, away from other human efforts and achievements.
A key task for anyone studying the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday life experiences. Just like mountain peaks are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists explain how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, art theorists should show how art is connected to human life.
To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the everyday experiences that we don't usually consider as aesthetic. This means taking a detour to understand art. Just like one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding art requires looking at the basic experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.
Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without considering them as art. This is because art is often seen as something that belongs in museums and galleries. However, the desire for enjoyable experiences finds its way into everyday life. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often still separate art from ordinary experiences.
The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday life and work. This connection makes appreciation more widespread and intense."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team: in the evening light, a group of silent cats jumps from the shadows like skilled hunters and surrounds their prey. Lions seem like the perfect social animals, putting aside small disagreements to work together for a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, others might benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are inactive. It has taken many research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a major event for the band, which had been talented but unstable. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. The serious and plain style of the past, with loud guitars, was replaced by a lighter mix of melodic local styles. The album combined social observation and strong emotions with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. They explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, sad songs like 'So Low', a beautiful tune about weather, and 'To the Brink', a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl', wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three books, then offered him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it was a lesson I never forgot. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I wanted to learn about, something relevant to my life. I'm not a keen traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting to be sorted - the so-called slush pile. This is usually done by a junior in the editorial department (under 18) or an experienced person who works part-time. Neither has much influence, but they want to find something original - the junior to make a name and find an author, the experienced person to keep their freelance job. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales, and also consider if you seem like a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them in your letter). They will also consider how promotable you are, which is important when a new novel needs support. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, it might have been the hardest time in your career. The recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 was tough: the GDP went down, interest rates stayed high, people spent less on everything except essentials, over half a million people lost their jobs, and about 75,000 homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with some industries like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% drop. Many people and companies in different countries suffered.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept theirs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help improve company profits and were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also had to do more with less money, being told that ""less must be more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies started focusing more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. This shift meant marketing got more attention from management, and some brands began to be marketed effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was seen as a solution to all problems, which it is not.
About half of most marketing budgets go to advertising, so advertising professionals felt the pressure. The 1980s were great for advertising, but the early 1990s were tough. This was partly due to the economy, but also because clients started questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money. Without clear evidence of advertising's benefits, many clients doubted its value. They wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work.
Advertising professionals faced the same problem as their clients: doing more with less. The recession made it hard to produce effective advertising. Production costs were controversial, and there was a reluctance to take risks, which are often key to good advertising. Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad.
These issues forced advertisers to reconsider the saying: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to make sure more advertising is effective. However, help for improving advertising is not easy to find. Companies and agencies are busy dealing with these challenges and are reluctant to share their successful strategies. Conferences and seminars might offer some help, but books on advertising often don't. They tend to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which doesn't help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was not a common choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't considered a desirable job. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs are known for having tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed-off and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. However, my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal for me. I first saw this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt like I wanted to thank the chef deeply. I felt happy and light for days. After this experience, I wanted to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt empty, distracting me from my real passion. I learned about cooking in a random and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making elaborate meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes, I said!"" The following week, I went up onto the high diving board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt like I was in silence. I moved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs went everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he couldn't take away my happiness. ""That's what they mean by 'free as a bird',"" I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both confusing and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing steep, icy mountains prone to avalanches; who sail alone in small boats through huge waves; who will eat maggots and river insects if there's nothing better to eat, and who can live for months in the uncertainty of the unknown. It's easy to see these people as odd - and they are - like hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their strange, uncomfortable world is far from our everyday experience and can be dismissed as irrelevant. We can ignore them and return to our world of microwaves and answering machines, grateful that the only risks we face are predictable ones, like running across a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a top sailor, though he is clearly a capable one. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and successes for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that tells sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a ""fundamental break in the relationship between man and sea."" Raban argues that since the compass was invented, about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, so they no longer need to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the sailor's job is just to stay on course, an autopilot can replace them for long periods. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought we were alone in feeling, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open in a new place, or when reading a great book, which shows us things we ignored before. Our mind becomes aware of new details, like the sky's colors, a friend's behavior, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important details. I could have made more changes, but that would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to predict this, it would not be a true report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and trying to understand what had already happened. This is the real story of mass travel: the world opening up to people who only need a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers are not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is labeled ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, many travelers are confused by the term.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck a few years ago. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in welcoming country houses for weeks. When I stopped traveling, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only made short notes instead of full stories. Worried that details might be out of order, I added many warnings in my writing. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story flow without too many explanations."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the market and trade growth in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Newspaper stories about publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often with help from the people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues we were playing at around the country were starting to sell out, and extra security was needed to control the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange confidence that only shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Challenges**
Technology keeps changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It's clear that more people will have access to music because it meets many human needs. Music is part of every major state event and offers many activities for individuals. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.
I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these findings need more support, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the near future.
Looking further ahead, will there be changes in focus, and if so, what will they be? I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to a wider variety of music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to create music without needing as much technical skill. However, this might also mean fewer live performances and less need for musicians who only perform live. At the same time, more people of all ages might want to make music themselves, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.
To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching should adapt to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring changes to stay relevant for more people. Music education will need to cover a wider range of skills. Musicians will need to inspire and teach people of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. Positively, this is a chance for music educators to show the quality of music teaching available.
Finally, we need to raise the importance of music. Music is vital in our lives but is often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors sometimes face criticism and disrespect. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichés or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked to explain her dance. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote that acting only has life when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Acting has no strict rules, except maybe being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is noticeable when discussing theatre work.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of youth and maturity, showing simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence make him a standout actor. Lester plays a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and likable. His performance is subtle yet clearly skilled. Watch how his body seems ready to come alive. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio shows a body moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a true expression? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the phrase, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize the scene. They find the reason to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages not to plan too much but to trust that something will happen naturally.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. Going to a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize that. It's off-putting if the staff seems indifferent. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. Everyone should feel they have a fair view of the actor, not too far away, and able to hear and see clearly. The size of the auditorium is important; it should suit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it loses the human touch essential to drama. Many theatres from the late 19th century got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. Theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, give a feeling of past human presence. You can't please everyone with a play, and audiences often don't know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real importance was how it changed the lives of middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for future rock stars, who listened to it and felt that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this fresh and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was a must-listen for many young people who wanted to become rock stars. Just like young John Lennon, who was far away in Liverpool listening to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.
**Snow**
There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow, which looked harmless, collapsed under me. I fell, surprised, into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had made a cover over a gap between two rocks, and it melted away, leaving only a thin layer that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against the top of a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only traveled about half a mile. It was clear that I needed to change my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books now that try to help researchers with qualitative research. While a lot has been written about collecting data, these books often don't explain much about how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers look at their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights and understanding of the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This means making hidden methods more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" acting out a scene from a TV show he watched. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't recall much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned more. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. While new technology can be useful for teaching, formal education still plays a crucial role.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by how much money a film makes. A good film might make someone a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village, with a narrow focus on films. People there talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave, working there but living elsewhere. Still, Hollywood is the place where almost everyone in show business eventually goes.
**Photography**
Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it in photography. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and chemicals on a flat surface created images that were more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists, and after their initial excitement, art critics argued that photography wasn't true art. They believed that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of art. They used photography to interpret the world and show their vision of nature and people, just like artists use brushes and pencils.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations, even novels for older readers. However, as the number of printed books decreased, this practice declined. Children's publishing was active but often operated on a low budget, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white illustrations from this time are a mix of ordinary and exceptional work, offering a rich area for research and discovery. The best works are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reissues of books or exhibitions of original illustrations. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may soon see the potential for reprinting classic children's book illustrations or creating new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This highlighted the risks of sharing too much online. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. 
Feeling down? Maybe, but don't lose hope. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the online world and faced its dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of fame, all before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others recognized the art in his work.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had criticized. This led to her losing her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"Title: Are We Getting Enough Sleep?
Tiredness is often said to be a common problem in modern life. As countries become richer and busier, more people seem to struggle with sleeplessness and anxiety. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. In Britain, some popular novels feature characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, its benefits, and the problems related to it. A key concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""
A sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle into sleeping about eight-and-a-quarter hours a night, showing they needed to catch up on lost sleep.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands studies sleep issues. They have looked into how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise impacts sleep, and the risks of driving when tired. They recruit volunteers through student newspapers, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep patterns for the study. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab is more interested in physical responses.
In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants arrive at 2 pm, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one person trying not to. At first, he sits upright, eyes fixed on the road. Then he starts blinking more often, his head nodding. Each nod gets heavier, and the blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, but by then, the car has veered off the road. A coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests using alertness products like tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain keeps the body still to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's creative parts. But these might also happen when we're awake but relaxed, so it's not certain. Scientists are sure that women sleep about half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, though they don't know why.
When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to pass time safely."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a ""morning sleep."" This break was a time for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily work. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which was more efficient. The industrial revolution later made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns further.
Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In some tribal societies, noise, fire-watching, and predator threats make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems that people worldwide need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing 800 dollars, while standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I didn't feel like a real cowboy. As I looked at the Arizona mountains in the morning sun, I realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver and briefly felt like a cowboy, but that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a dirty bag. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word.
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. It was my passion and all I knew how to do. But now, I can't race anymore. I wondered what I should do next. A racing driver should have other plans for when they stop racing, but mine seemed to vanish. I thought about becoming a commentator for races, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work out because nobody was buying them.
Being an ""ex"" anything is tough. People don't want to hear stories about almost being a champion. Even if I had been a champion, people would only listen for a short time. I don't want sympathy because I had a good career and made money. But I miss the thrill of racing, the fast cars, and the excitement. I miss being famous, even a little bit. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me, and kids wanted my autograph.
Now that I don't race, my phone hardly rings. I have a lot of free time. I looked at the sky and noticed there were no buzzards, just some small birds in a cactus nearby. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I realized I had a lot to learn about life outside of racing, just like a fake cowboy in fancy boots."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, locals like to walk around the city, and if you join them, you'll probably hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and work. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that new residents and a growing tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still very much a gateway city.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists, like me, are often not very good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think we're that focused on money. It's more likely because, in our work, we always try to make a big impact, so the natural flow of a letter is lost on us. Real creative artists, who don't consciously think about the impact of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I think the true test of a real artist is their natural understanding of the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed his talent as a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer, who knew someone working there, said the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and those who arrived late feel envious."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film. Despite receiving mostly excellent reviews, the film was not a commercial hit at first. It was television that later made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many people to become filmmakers. This is even more impressive because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film's success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head in agreement, but it seemed like she wasn't really listening. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I mentioned, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.
**Title Race**
Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more impressive job title over a pay raise. If our desire for status is so strong that it even surpasses our basic desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways of saying the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"I was in Vienna to take photos. That was usually why I traveled anywhere. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how one photo could capture the essence of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, as long as I had film in my camera. I would finish one roll, load another, and keep looking for that perfect shot. This was my way of life for a long time.
I once took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular. Newspapers and magazines around the world wanted it. It was a brief moment of success, mostly due to luck. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer. It seemed like a smart move, but life didn't go as planned. The mid-1990s weren't as successful as I had hoped, even though my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad.
The Vienna assignment came by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The publishers liked my work, and when the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the project, they asked me to take his place. I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers, so I accepted. Things at home weren't going well, so a week in snowy Vienna sounded good to me.
They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in cold January, it felt different. As soon as I arrived, I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos. The first day, I just explored the city by tram, getting a feel for the place. The weather was cold and the city was full of grand old buildings. I hadn't seen Schussner's photos from other seasons because I wanted to capture my own version of Vienna.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. I spent time observing until I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn. Fresh snow had covered Stephansplatz, making it look untouched and almost empty. I wasn't sure how to photograph the cathedral in one shot because its spire was tall like a giraffe's neck, but the base was large and heavy. I decided to focus on part of it, hoping to capture something magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even when you understand how it works. Watching a photo develop in a dark room is still mysterious. Maybe that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**  
Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, heavily advertised show, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the 20th century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for a long time, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are displayed with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney**  
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative, making it easy to understand, or because it deals with themes of leisure and escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and clever words, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is just an overrated minor artist. However, one could argue that he seems minor because being popular is not always accepted today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only time will tell his true place in art history.
**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**  
In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by the fact that they were art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but worked together through their contrasts. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**  
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might ruin their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking at art and the act of creating it. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from enjoying the dish. Understanding something doesn't stop us from enjoying it; it might even enhance our pleasure. Enjoyment is complex, and how we perceive it can be questioned. Our preferences are influenced by societal values, not just our genes or personalities. While it's important to appreciate the sensory and instinctive responses to art, the idea that intellectual thought undermines sensory enjoyment is an outdated belief."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have first become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow stone. It didn't feel like a regular stone, but it was beautiful. This is how gold might have become important to early humans. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.
**St Ives**
We walked down the narrow, cobbled street into the town, carrying our bags. The wind was very strong, and we tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the waterfront cottages were shut tight against the storm. We had seen the weather getting worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. The dark grey skies made us question our decision to visit Cornwall in the off-season without a car. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through good and bad times are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling can help us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how these virtual societies react."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean trouble for the current leader. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the leader gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked well until the leader made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while calmly walking in the open, revealing his trick.
**What Cats Catch**
In the English village of Felmersham, people collected the prey caught by their cats over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these numbers, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch fewer prey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest there for a while. Eventually, they start swimming, appearing tired and almost submerged, but they spend the day grazing among the reeds and bulrushes.
**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**
In early 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The fish and crab look alive, and the painting is hard to interpret because Picasso used overlapping and interlocking transparent shapes. The colors and brushwork create a calm, underwater feel. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp forms and even a chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography has been around for about 150 years and has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown in its ability to capture moments in time and space, allowing us to see both big and small things. It has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become a powerful way to express human experiences.
However, using images to record events is not new. The earliest examples of pictorial recording date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early humans created cave paintings—whether they were recording real events, using them for magic to increase animals for hunting, as religious symbols, or simply to decorate their living spaces. But images have always been a part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given visual images a special status. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it promised to provide a truthful visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This was a big achievement because artists had spent centuries trying to create such realistic images.
Because photographs seemed so real, people thought everyone would naturally understand them, leading to the idea that photography could be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. But as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we began to question whether photography could truly cross cultural boundaries. Is photography as influenced by culture as language is? Have we become so used to photographs that we overlook the complex ways they convey reality?
Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem like a transparent way to communicate. For example, when someone shows a photo from their wallet, saying ""this is my grandson,"" it feels natural. Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people view it have changed a lot. Initially, it was a way to record events, but now photographs have become historical documents, revealing much about the people and societies that created them.
I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not just reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century saw cultural changes partly due to new ways of visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world in a way that is accessible to many."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching someone how to write poetry is tricky. It's like walking through a dangerous area: you need to be spontaneous, but one mistake can ruin everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination and spirit be free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can write even when they are unhappy. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid, as long as they are not just copying someone else's rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, there isn't space for too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something important. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly and keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. Conflict and action should be strong, and every word should matter in the limited space.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing the outcome, seeing only a few moves ahead. As they play more, they realize that chess is about long-term strategy, not just short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game and recognize patterns, like openings and end games. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, as seen in young children, but they don't naturally write. Language exists in all societies, and while languages change, they don't necessarily get better. All healthy children learn to speak without formal lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and has improved slowly over time. Until recently, many children didn't learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. Children naturally learn to speak, but writing is a skill that must be taught carefully. We need to understand how writing works and how children's minds work to teach them effectively."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started writing a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters made-up names and taken care to ensure no one recognizes them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong, kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was remarkable. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be helpful to his future biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for things that matter to me. I have written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but I have taken the same liberty as historians to create speeches for people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. The smart reader will notice where I've used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I hesitated to write this book is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It's hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they enjoyed, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't understand them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen, and if I have written about others in short stories, it's because you can describe characters briefly in them. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't claim my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It is only later that people can see clear patterns and recognize important works. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be written, presented, and understood. There is a general debate between two groups: serious 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on paper, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. However, this division is not strict.
Public poetry readings have become more common over the last twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often expected to perform their work publicly, which has mixed results for them. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live audiences, public performances are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard once, but may seem less impressive when read on paper.
On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, aiming to express deep emotions and thoughts in a concise and rhythmically complex way, may not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. The risk is not that these poets will copy the style of entertainers, but that they might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience.
Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work helps listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm intended by the poet. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's unrealistic to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status compared to the interviewee and the historian's way of understanding history, which might affect the interviewee's responses. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the interviewee's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions in the testimony can seem convincing but might not be from the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**
Animal science can be studied in two main ways: focusing on the body's functions or looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body's parts, like nerves and muscles, work together to create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the animal's behavior and what influences it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs, studying how animals like rats and pigeons learn. Ethologists study natural behaviors in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more basic. However, understanding every nerve cell's function doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that must be studied separately. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
Students new to social sciences face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of the subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research in textbooks and the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge. These two parts are closely connected. Since we all experience social life daily, social sciences might seem like common sense. However, textbooks show that each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses specific study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, helping social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. Before Vitruvius' time, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that didn't meet his artistic standards. Despite being simple, these early structures contributed to later architectural ideas. No matter how elaborate it looks, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She would finish her drive near the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found out and was amused by Lily's secret driving. He praised her, saying, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought men were strange because Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of the next month, as it was the quietest day for their business. They planned to leave early and return by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
On the day of the trip, they left the house and, within an hour, were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded her. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she decided to pay for parking to avoid any trouble. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""Don't worry, no one will want that heap of tin,"" which annoyed the sisters. Lily accused him of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for judging by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing and thought about his son's future. Chen wanted Man Kee to have a good education and own many restaurants one day.
The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly—a small, old, rusty ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope and said, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It's special for people like us. It will take us back home when we're done here."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Chen let Lily look through the telescope. However, by then, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and all Lily could see were seagulls following the ship's path."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle as I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, but I fell immediately. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had sort of succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit on the head. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear worried voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and old Arthur. Mother was shouting and waving her hands. Father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I hid in the shadows, feeling a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was horrified that no one had seen them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops shone in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one noticed them. Mother was screaming, a sound I had never heard before. It made me feel guilty. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. It had gone from a clever idea to a big problem that wouldn't go away without someone, probably me, getting in trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. From a smart plan to a disaster in just a few minutes. Then I had an idea. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and dizzy. I called out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled forward and collapsed dramatically. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I pretended to be relieved and said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I claimed I crawled and swam through it to escape. I thought I was convincing them until Father asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. Trying to cover up, I said the tunnel collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking it. I said the well was dangerous and I barely escaped. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars. It was like he saw me for the first time, and I realized how my story must sound to an adult. My words stopped. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked at me, his face sad and worried, not because I had a scary adventure and wasn't believed, but because he saw through my lie and was concerned about my character. His pity was as painful as my father's words, showing that this was the adult judgment of my actions, not something I could ignore. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. Memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air like dust.
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked how they would bring the house home. Now, Robert was there to help with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Her daughter Francesca was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano with enough care.
Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry. He explained that many people cry when they see their home being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place. Susan could understand this feeling. She remembered when they first moved in, and the piano got stuck on the stairs. It took hours to get it inside, and they even had to remove some banister rails. Her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem by hiring a builder to take out a window and using a crane to lift the piano inside.
Now, Susan was worried about the piano again. She hadn't warned the movers about the tricky stairs. As the movers prepared to take the piano out, Susan felt anxious. Fred reassured her that they were almost done. Robert and Francesca watched as the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out the door. When it was safely outside, they all started laughing with relief. As they walked down the path for the last time, Susan's tears were tears of laughter, not sadness."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
Is do-it-yourself literary criticism just harmless fun? From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or start a music channel online. In reality, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to share their opinion on a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it let potential buyers see what other readers thought, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions.
Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. But Amazon, being the largest with over 80% of the online market, attracted the most reviews and, therefore, faced the most issues. This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and it was impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team of editors to ensure reviews followed their guidelines. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks, or spoilers were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team.
This anonymity allowed for some mischief. For example, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. Lev Grossman, an author, wrote fake positive reviews for his book after receiving negative ones. His trick worked until he admitted it in an article, and the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon did not verify if the comments were truly from the authors, except for famous writers. A fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed because it was clearly not from him.
Most controversies came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it was praised by the mainstream press. However, people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon's review section to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but were later removed. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. Reviews were meant to be a place to discuss books, not a chat room, so Amazon closely monitored bestselling books to ensure reviews followed the rules. Silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology.
Overall, most Amazon reviews were serious and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant inventing feelings about books one didn't care about. This makes the democratization of book reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to modern art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, claiming it is no longer art. The media often express these thoughts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in contemporary art. We want artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that cannot be contained by conventions. In the past, people would commission artists for specific purposes, making art a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own ideas and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it doesn't seem too mysterious. But if it does, that's modern art for you. Here's the situation: An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This sounds like simple thinking. But stay with me. The situation gets more complex. The artist asks someone to make a canvas, stretch it, and prepare it. Then, he asks a sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas, instructing them not to make the lettering flashy or charming. The sign painter writes the text in simple black letters on a white canvas. So, my important question is: Is the finished product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June
In the art world, it is often expected that once a painter finds success in a certain style, they should stick to it. Collectors want artists to keep producing similar work, and trying something new can upset them. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public may feel insecure and want consistency. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed. Picasso and Hockney are examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new, and it is uncertain if he will succeed. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Railways have always fascinated Rimmington. After drawing the railway land of London's Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, it was natural for him to explore underground. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique magic of this underground world designed for people on the move.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I am not sure why I use the word 'escape.' The villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from the old peasant woman who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am completely alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of the work I do with my mind and heart is that only there, in the silence of the painter or writer, can reality be reorganized and shown in its true form. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the beautiful pattern underneath. For us artists, art offers a joyful way to deal with everything that hurt or defeated us in daily life. This is not to avoid destiny, as ordinary people try to do, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,C2,-9
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with their money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had been successful in his work, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency shortly after having twins. She even got a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who really wanted to move, and Simon didn't resist much. She argued that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't good enough for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 
To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him feel resentful. During these journeys, he would think about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. His grandmother believed in giving the breadwinner peace and comfort after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.
Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset. She had confronted Simon with accusations. She claimed that Brian Cartwright, whom Simon had defended four years ago, said Simon knew Cartwright had bribed jurors but did nothing. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied these accusations, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered feeling similar shame as a child facing punishment. He wished he had been prepared and could have responded better. He thought he should have said Cartwright mentioned the bribes after the trial, but he didn't believe him then and still didn't. Instead, he lied directly, and Venetia knew it. Simon wondered why she was so angry and what his past mistake had to do with her. He questioned if her own actions were always perfect. He feared she could ruin his career, even if it was just a rumor."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops start to recognize you, even if you don't feel like you're living a real life. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I'm watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back the plants. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall to survive.
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested in them. I have her latest book with me now. ""How's the writing going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,"" she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't really want her in the garden, which now looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. ""You're on holiday now,"" she says, sitting in the chair while I sit on the grass. ""I should've been a teacher. Writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can't, teach."" And some can't do either. ""What are your plans for the holidays?"" she asks. I feel anxious about the empty days ahead. Hot pavements, the walk to the shops, the park, and loneliness.
""I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?"" I ask, feeling nervous. ""Of course,"" Jaz says, knowing she will be around. ""Where will you stay? A nice B&B?"" ""No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight."" This isn't true, but I often deal with fiction. ""Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?"" Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could seem cruel, always bringing things to other houses and returning her rejected manuscripts. I decide to be honest. ""Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good,"" I suggest. ""Teachers!"" Jaz responds like a rebellious student. ""I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,"" I say, sounding old-fashioned. ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann."" But I do have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calming, but then I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, winking and saying, ""I've had my moments."" We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and their lives. But beyond that, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and as a nation. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the future by understanding the past. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture passed down through generations. There might be parts of our national heritage we don't like, but it is still part of us, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we connected with our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society broke up communities, and much of this oral tradition has been lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identity.
**The Fens**
I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I thought the Fens were a quiet, empty place to set my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, there is a place that feels foreign to many English people, even though other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open and mysterious. While writing my novel, I didn't visit many places in the Fens. I haven't been to Wisbech or Prickwillow yet. As a fiction writer, I like to imagine worlds and prefer to make inspired guesses rather than rely on facts. Imagining the Fens makes sense because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogs, and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items that only museums can provide.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly now that it affects most of us. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature of towns today and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before them because stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**  
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used in ads for smart products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking basic concepts like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people relied on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**  
When we were kids, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would hint at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.
**Language**  
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mysterious origin has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller claimed that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. Humans in dangerous lands with scary animals made desperate sounds, and languages have kept some of these sounds, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, unlike what philosopher John Locke thought when he described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode looks at the skill of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are written quickly and have a short lifespan. They have deadlines and strict word limits. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in, which could be a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this short life, reviews are often not seen as important literature. Many people, including the writers, think reviewing is a job done for extra money or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a complex and skilled job. Writing a short, fair review of 600-800 words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed 6,000-8,000 word review for an international journal. A 1,500-word review in a weekly magazine has challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. Reviewers need to know a lot about many topics and write clearly and engagingly. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews, even short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think less famous writers should accept that their reviews are temporary, but if they can, they should enjoy some recognition, especially if they believe their best work is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, it's common for the same people to write both reviews and academic studies. In the past, academics criticized professors who wrote reviews for showing off or wasting time, but now it's more accepted. Complaints from non-professors that professors are taking their jobs are also less common, partly because there are more reviews to write and partly because the pay is often low. I believe this is good for readers, who can trust the reviewer knows the subject, and for professors, as it helps them stay connected to a wider audience. It reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when writing for a general audience. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, still hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a brief doubt about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if it had been. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to spending three or four evenings alone at home each week. Once he left the artificial world of the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his belongings, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited in vain for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would often read or listen to music at night, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed to get lost in his mind. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first opportunity that came along. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he found he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find happiness in his work. He went to his only job interview with gratitude and didn't think to evaluate the job—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see a goat race. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track where the goats would run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since the morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.
**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 
You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance. Ask colleagues to think of difficult questions your audience might ask. Also, create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some mental tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing mental math faster. But other tasks cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line. Saying ""Think fast; we need the results"" can be as silly as trying to sleep for only half the night. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. Generally, the mind has three different speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my brain and body quickly reacted to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast physical intelligence is often called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, building arguments, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won't start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment all use this type of intelligence, which relies on reason and logic. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is another, slower mental process. It is often less focused and more relaxed or dreamy. In this mode, we are thinking things over, being contemplative or meditative. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind time to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. In fact, slow thinking is an important part of our mental abilities. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed, open mental attitude. Recent studies show that slower, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options might be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and even ""wisdom."" Poets have long known the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists started to study these slower ways of knowing. The field of ""cognitive science"" is showing that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote area. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my confidence. I felt nervous about mealtimes, unsure which table to sit at, and worried about the silence when I spoke. I felt anxious like I did in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage my speaking skills usually give me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just another young author, and he didn't pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face, and when we met again, he would shake my hand politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed Elliot started to like me more. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films. He focused on the photography, soundtrack, and technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people reacted to pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film was designed well, audiences from Japan and India would react at the same moment. Hitchcock was precise and logical, a genius craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his characters deeply. He focused on pure film and the calculated beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create almanacs and charts, analyze observations, and publish results. This might seem like the best time ever for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Today, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Our society has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In today's economy, people always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, one after another. This can be overwhelming and stressful, leading to a feeling of disconnect from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can keep track of.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It's a family tradition started by my grandmother, and now it feels very special. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I don't like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem like they might pat you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them around the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
An outstanding production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London, giving me a chance to correct a previous unfair review I wrote when it first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the main role and underestimated his acting skills. Although I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important to the story, I now admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is truly impressive. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include Cassio's intense games with other young officers, which become dangerously chaotic, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are amazing. Don't miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the center of Antarctica, everything is still. While there are many penguins, seals, and birds on the edges of the continent, the vast white interior is lifeless. However, beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, there is a huge hidden freshwater lake called Lake Vostok, located directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths to find out what unusual organisms might live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years could be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is debating what motivates them to become scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the timeless quest for knowledge and the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire in the first place and why science can't explain it. Surely, it's more important to consider whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too much sugar and preservatives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays, anniversaries, and engagements, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had vandalized the place. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she wasn't going to help with the office mess. She believed he was like a visitor from another world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn streets.
**KAREN**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed as a reminder of past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's exciting to be the first to know something important, and her quiet life didn't have much excitement. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly throat infections, which were her only health issues. His best quality was making patients feel he had plenty of time for them and truly wanted to hear their worries. This quality made him very loved by the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Joanna's performances are exciting, and even people who don't know much about music can enjoy them. She plays many different styles, like classical, jazz, and blues, and even does fun tricks like plucking the piano strings. At a recent concert for children, a boy asked her to play the theme from ""Match of the Day,"" a popular TV show. Joanna found this amusing and played it, proving to the boy that she was a ""proper pianist.""
Joanna is unique among top pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play the piano. She has published a beginner's piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even though she is very busy. This summer, she is involved in many music festivals and projects, and she also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. People are surprised she took on the extra work of writing a book, but she believes the first lessons in music are very important. She thinks music should be accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent.
Joanna's experience with teaching beginners and growing up in a home where her mother taught piano has influenced her. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children learn quickly, but she is interested in those who progress at different rates and sometimes give up. She worries that some parents push their children too hard to achieve in music, rather than letting them enjoy it.
Joanna's books are colorful and engaging, with storylines and CDs to make learning fun. She believes learning should be enjoyable and encourages children to improvise and explore the piano. As children progress, they need to learn to read music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes practice is the most important part of learning. She didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she learned to love it. Now, she practices eight hours a day, which she considers the core of her musical life. She advises setting clear goals for practice, rewarding yourself, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is usually not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is difficult to achieve. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard, which made me think more carefully. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with more care. On the other hand, using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said as he returned to the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's incredible they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, as he turned on the hi-fi system. Lights came on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't use both sides and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my chair. ""Anyway, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo sound, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches were invented after lighters, we'd be amazed by the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time, and such claims are often self-centered, thinking their generation is at a historical turning point. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. This prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to read only small parts. Some technology enthusiasts argue that this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text in one go.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was free of the papers that had covered it since it was installed, and the desk was the dark wood he remembered from an auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about adding a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talents. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,C2,"Lancelot's secretary shouted, ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" She wasn't really asking because she had been making him coffee for months. She often forgot things because he wasn't supposed to be there. However, he was there all the time now because staying away would cause chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work.
His secretary handed him a folder, saying it was from someone in Los Angeles. The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert"" and ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis; he wanted a first draft. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but commissioning books from friends had been a mistake. Ian was unpredictable and unreliable.
Lancelot skimmed the synopsis, recognizing almost every phrase. He realized Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and seemed to lack conviction. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But Ian had already received a large advance, which went against the usual business practice of paying authors after they deliver a manuscript.
Lancelot recalled when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge, where his peers took over British theatre. Ian was even more talented but never fulfilled his potential. He was difficult to work with, even when appointed to edit an arts magazine, which never published despite using up its budget. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased in hopes of making him produce more.
At editorial meetings, Ian was critical and sarcastic, but ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to admit that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"'The breakfast change in England
Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is a relatively new habit in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common for everyone. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. However, they might not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns could explain why breakfast became more important. People started working set hours, often very early in the morning. So, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might understand the photos they see, but instead of just accepting them, we might ask if the photo truly shows what the scene looked like at that moment. Or, does it show the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus entirely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows you to shine individually, but it's also a team game, and you need to balance both. It's similar to life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot - not just money. It has opened opportunities for me and shown me things around the world that others might never see. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences are so vivid that they stand out clearly in our memories. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was lying awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from somewhere in the tall trees around the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I thought of my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with amazement as each surprising musical variation came through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"Birds have always been important in human culture. They are loved, feared, and even worshipped. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 
In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. Wrens are seen as mysterious birds, linked to predictions and messages. Is this wren trying to tell us something, or is it just trapped? Both ideas could be true, depending on how you see it. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, wrens still hold a special place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty and sad.
This connection to birds comes from a long history of folklore. In the past, people depended on nature for survival and developed a way to understand the world through the behavior of animals. This understanding changes over time. For example, in the 1500s, red kites were common in London and were seen as helpful scavengers. Later, they were considered pests and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain.
Our relationship with birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn of danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected people to their dreams and the supernatural. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and envy. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of us, like the appendix or wisdom teeth. Losing them would be painful.
Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings, representing love and magic. Their loss is felt deeply by those who know their significance in literature and folklore. However, birds without cultural stories are often ignored when they disappear.
Folklore is important because it keeps the connection to birds alive in a way that scientific terms cannot. Stories, legends, and rhymes about birds have a strong bond with their subjects and evoke feelings and attitudes that science cannot capture. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we don't fully understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages.
The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding a mystery in its song and flying into the future, leaving us to wonder."
CPE_28,C2,"Maps are used to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through an area than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, knowing ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" was more crucial than precise directions. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, sometimes more so than maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions accurately. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of these signs depended on the map's purpose and where it was made, so understanding early maps requires knowing the specific style used.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and making maps more detailed. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people started using the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it. Astronomers found out that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for military purposes, especially after the introduction of artillery, which required understanding the landscape in detail. This led to the invention of contour lines to show elevation. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps for their work. Today's map makers, or cartographers, have developed ways to map various things, like geological layers, climate, and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.
However, the development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change, with old ideas sometimes existing alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what needed to be done but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since making a map by copying an old one is easy, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers have sometimes been slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"I was invited into a young man's living room, which felt like a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms around it where his less ambitious family members spent their time. Moving from the kitchen to his living room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. In this room, I saw the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprisingly, a teenager who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't a matter of life or death, although it's easy to say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy goal for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I was open to trying it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' record collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and showing him a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact in musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we didn't succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the brief certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would, of course, keep looking at the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and would write a few more simple songs that didn't show the limits of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't really inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, borrowing too much from Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title as well, most of which had probably been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have an amazing ability: we can communicate with each other in a very precise way. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a special spider teacher, and they don't need to be good at building to do it.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can change the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Daily weather patterns, which together make up the climate, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing because the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement happens because the air is on a spinning Earth, and it doesn't move as fast as the planet. The sun is an even more important cause of air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks, but I was more worried about making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, including how to clean and maintain the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be sent back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get good at it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often fail to make good programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These art forms should be perfect for TV because cameras can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see details. However, there are few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I thought the series would focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of the industry, and it fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't come with one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis available. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Title: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
At the Bamboo Bike Club in Hackney Wick, east London, you can join a weekend course to build your own custom bamboo bike frame. The club is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. On a Saturday morning, the sound of machinery fills the air as participants start their bike-building journey. The atmosphere is lively and fun, unlike any typical woodwork class.
Bamboo is becoming popular in bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, their ready-made bamboo frames are expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable, so they spent years developing a product that average cyclists could afford. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell frames.
The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business. James and Ian run it alongside their full-time jobs—James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. Their courses are popular because they offer a custom-designed bike frame and a fun weekend experience at a competitive price.
For someone like me, who isn't great at DIY, the quality of the bike was a concern. On the first day, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and form solid joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes together to form the bike's frame. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. The course requires using tools and following design plans, which can be challenging for beginners. However, James and Ian are always there to help and ensure everything is done correctly.
Most participants enjoy the hands-on experience, and many are engineers. But even if you're not, Ian assures that mistakes are okay—you can always try again with a new piece of bamboo. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, allowing you to focus on the frame's appearance, choosing from plain, black, or mottled bamboo.
On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. A final coating makes the bike waterproof, and it's ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian has used his bamboo bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without damage.
Bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they have a unique charm. They are ideal for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making the ride comfortable. James says the real joy comes when the bike is on the road—it's light, effortless, and fun to ride. And the best part? The cost is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now very wealthy, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how men and women can communicate better is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans improve their lives, but it also takes advantage of their desires for self-improvement. It supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books that seem exaggerated or not very serious. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. Editors are looking for the next big hit, focusing on how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions. She admits, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's most of the work done. You know you can reach people.""
**Autobiographies**
There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth will be told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers might leave out things they find too embarrassing or unimportant. Sometimes, they might change the truth to better express their story. An autobiographer might even decide from the start not to stick to the truth. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without being cynical.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Experts say detective stories became popular because they reflect the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it shows how society can return to order. In Hammett's stories, society is restored but shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are similar. They understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The detective is both a criminal and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his understanding of the criminal, and sometimes his desire to punish is stronger because of this.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To talk about his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said, ""I couldn't write about a place like this. Trollope might, but he knew the culture. Understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. Science is like its own civilization. Only scientists can present it well. If you don't know the community and its rules, you struggle from the start."" Gould believes you should never talk down to the reader. ""Don't make concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but not the argument. If readers feel patronized, your piece fails."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. This is because the gym has used too much air-conditioning to cope with the unusually high temperatures this summer. At quieter times, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It has become a key part of both work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple methods can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is not surprising that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations—interesting but outdated in a modern world. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I used to think of china-painting as something done by serious, older women who could paint perfect flowers on teacups without any mistakes. I saw this at an arts and crafts show long ago, and it was fascinating to watch. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed like they had either practiced for many years or had a natural talent. Remembering this, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners also have this natural skill? In reality, the class was not intimidating at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher didn't want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly and perfectly as I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent told them that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they arrived at the hotel, and they were too tired to question it. The next morning, they realized they were supposed to stay there for the whole holiday. The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken.
Keith calmly explained that they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said their group was booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, approached them. She explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and they might have followed the wrong group.
Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left to check, and the receptionist was gone. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened. An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted his thoughts, saying they had a great night's sleep.
Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had even said that was the point of the holiday when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"American executives are now looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports on this trend. In Britain, many people know about Sir Ernest Shackleton and his achievements. However, in America, he has only recently gained attention. The Wall Street Journal even called him 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the Endurance are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about his life.
Some American managers have started to see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his leadership and communication skills and use his story as a lesson for modern management. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has been inspired by Shackleton for years. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises, like when a company's plant explodes or when many employees are laid off. MacGregor believes that Shackleton is a great example of leadership because he was a strong communicator and had clear values. He was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives.
One of Shackleton's most important decisions was during his 1908 expedition to the South Pole. He decided to turn back when they were only 97 miles away from their goal because their supplies were running low, and they needed to return to their ship. This decision showed his commitment to the safety of his men, which earned him credibility for future expeditions.
Shackleton's 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Despite this, Shackleton assured his men that they would reach safety if they trusted him and did their best. He always stayed in control, planned for every situation, and kept his men informed. He was adaptable and ready to start over if needed. MacGregor says that Shackleton's story helps clients understand management principles without feeling criticized.
Shackleton believed that an explorer needed optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor points out that in America, people often want quick solutions, but sometimes it's better to wait and let things work out. For example, if you invest in bonds and the interest rates change, it's better to hold on rather than sell at a loss. Similarly, if a new product isn't successful, don't keep trying to sell it.
Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed that the expedition photographer, Hurley, was without gloves. Shackleton gave him his own gloves, insisting that Hurley wear them. He did the same with a biscuit during a 1905 expedition when they were starving, showing his selflessness. Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says that the public's interest in heroic stories is growing, and Shackleton represents the ideals we long for today."
