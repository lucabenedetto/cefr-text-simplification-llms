CPE_15,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy, but it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Rubbish bags or bins are collected regularly and taken to a landfill. Economists find this service strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that fills four bins pays the same as an elderly couple that fills one. However, rubbish disposal is not free. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities pay more in landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The solution seems to be to make households pay for the rubbish they throw away. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming there are places to recycle. 

However, American economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this approach has complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per tagged bag, the authors found that the benefits did not cover the costs of the scheme. The number of bags fell by 37%, but this was mainly because people crammed more rubbish into each bag, a practice known as the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%, and in other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying. 

One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, but this might not be due to the fee, as many people were already recycling. In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing reduces rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts rubbish by 0.3%. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything, and a small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In richer towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 

Should we stop charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Today, just being successful in your career isn't enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous people can feel bitter. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to consider how your work affects you personally, including your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can focus on fulfilling personal aspirations, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also offer a meaningful lifestyle, help discover hidden talents, and provide diverse human interactions. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment is the only goal. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs aren't as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers are losing confidence in their roles. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are getting smaller. Efforts like decentralizing decisions, improving skills, and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's values.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or sometimes harm people. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and how courage can be developed. I've looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts work on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people work in hotels with low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is more than a place to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations where people from around the world meet but often don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they have limited interaction with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the skills of the students they employ, rather than just giving them basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's ambitions, they could offer more services. But accountants often say companies should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one.

For me, work is about relationships. Now that people want more than just obedience and see work as a way to express independence, they should have the chance to design their jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon and connect with different minds. Everyone knows communication is important, but true conversation is different. It's a deeper interaction that creates respect and helps understand others, often changing us in the process. It's more than just relaxing; it's a way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world a little bit."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This idea is not only about farming but also about modern growth and development. It suggests spreading resources widely to produce a good result, like a harvest. Broadcasting assumes there is a central source of information that can be shared with many people.

The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a two-way communication tool. Yet, from the start, it was seen as a one-way, centralised 'mass' medium. This setup matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of organising television were tried but did not last.

Two interesting alternatives to traditional broadcasting deserve mention. In the early 1930s in Britain, radio enthusiasts experimented with two-way television, similar to a telephone. Magazines like Radio News explained how to build TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these hobbyists out. This ended the chance for television to develop as a grassroots, equal form of communication in Britain.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structure of modern societies. In the USA in the early 1930s, television was mainly used for public shows and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, most people watched TV in public places. Although the idea of two-way, amateur television was not successful, public viewing of TV was common in the 1930s and could have challenged the idea of TV as a home-based medium. But this did not happen. Manufacturers saw the potential for selling TVs to homes once prices dropped. As people in Western countries gained better living standards from the 1920s, the dream of having entertainment at home became possible for many.

Broadcasting is closely linked to social modernisation. As societies became more centralised and traditional communities broke up, people became more mobile and isolated. Centralised broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of national community. This made broadcasting the dominant form of radio and TV.

Broadcasting also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information needed for informed participation in society. However, as television changes, the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. It may only refer to a specific way of organising audio-visual technology during a certain period of social modernisation."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have a certain product, we are not good enough. To see how much ads affect you, try not to read any billboards next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in strong ways without us even noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on how they form, their water systems, and their biology. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, which makes us curious and eager to learn more about them. Because they are natural wonders, caves have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they have affected how people live. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and amateurs who enjoy visiting caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**  
Many people who paid attention to the weather without any tools laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has become a very technical science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools send us weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorology uses many long words that can be hard to understand for non-experts. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still important for turning computer data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can still provide unique information that helps professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is primarily about music, with theatre coming second. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.

At musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including myself, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about what they don't know, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics match. We know athletes are doing something similar to running for a bus, but they do it much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't particularly impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences. In fact, many people attend both. However, in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play or event.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it connects with the listener's imagination. However, the way music is presented often feels too formal, with strict dress codes and too much respect for conductors and soloists, creating a hierarchy between players and listeners. On the other hand, when audiences interrupt performances by clapping between movements, it can disrupt the flow of the music, even if it's meant as appreciation.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who were not just watching but also participating.

What I hope for in music is more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes this comes from using unusual or challenging locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous. I know most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe something should change in music conventions. I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music, and I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly an annoying obstacle between a car park by the sea and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong water hose. But here's the strange part: as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you keep finding piles of sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand flies around when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, I don't like sand at all.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security since they first started building houses. The simple wooden beam behind the door has been replaced by electronic locks that use a plastic card with many combinations. But the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' is still there. Locks and keys are partly about feeling safe. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locks, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't like them much. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a real key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in it.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I don't really understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and big photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have more opinions. But you're not supposed to analyze it like a school essay. The idea is to let art speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed were the labels, real labels that explained the context of a work and what it was trying to say. Instead of just staring at the pictures without understanding, these bits of information helped me get it."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When novels are turned into films, the story often needs to be shortened and simplified. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and description in a novel can be left out, yet the main idea still comes through. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about how each medium—books and films—engages the audience differently and uses repetition in its own way. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In plays, dialogue often mimics real speech, sometimes using extra words just to keep the conversation going, even if it doesn't add much meaning.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can be an immersive experience, making you feel part of the film's world. For the duration of the movie, you escape from reality. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. In the past, movies were seen as just entertainment, not art. Many people, including our parents and teachers, thought movies were not serious art, even though they enjoyed watching them.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, making it hard to find your way around. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but many rooms looked the same and were hard to distinguish. There were three main entrances, but none had a clear sign or information desk to help visitors. However, strangers were rare because the studio didn't encourage them. Employees knew their way around and worked together to create films that offered audiences a break from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are full of guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses on filmmaking. Competitions even offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his film El Mariachi, which cost $7,000 and made him a well-known director. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his breakthrough film by age 23. In the past, filmmakers took longer to succeed. They started in smaller roles, like editors or writers, and learned by making low-budget films. Directors like John Huston and Fred Zinnemann only became successful later in life. Today, without the support of big studios, new filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of crowded, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulfur. It was common to see a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he delivered papers in the morning. I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. 

Later, I have memories of faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of a mansion at Earlham. My mother often appears in these memories. She was a small, precise, and usually angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to shops in Bunnett Square or into the city, I noticed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I knew, feeling alone even in a room full of people. She was also very strict about behaving properly, which was rare in West Earlham. This sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly.' I didn't understand this moral code then, and I still don't fully understand it now. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and following many other rules.

Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier but not fully accepted by the others. Later, I realized they were not great company. They often talked about their health, the weather, and ungrateful children, a group I felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders. I felt I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it, but it wasn't easy.

Growing up in West Earlham followed a routine. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat in an armchair. After your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. Some lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats. My mother let me go with other children for this journey. 

If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays. During these times, I saw glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and talked about the League of Pity, a junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying they just wanted money. She often talked about people having selfish motives, especially politicians, whom she deeply distrusted. She thought of the House of Commons as a place where rich people took money from the public. I might be exaggerating, but my mother didn't have much kindness. 

To be fair, my mother cared about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she took me in my 'good clothes' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn't mind this activity and even started to have opinions about the art. I remember her once joking about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly rain. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well since I was a child. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Even if I didn't know everyone by name, each house was familiar to me, like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get smaller, and the front yards became tiny. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a style that seemed Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops, with the smells of old merchandise still there.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors. Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space because it was hard to separate work from home life. So, he used a large sheet of corrugated plastic to divide the space. This created a hallway and led the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area for both cooking for friends and making coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel, he used light wood for the floors. His flat has futuristic furniture but also sentimental pieces from his parents or markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and mysteries, but he was a brilliant writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was imaginative, like a thriller, and had the charm of romantic fiction. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction to make stories more interesting. He believed that through travel, one could discover histories that seemed to exist just to fascinate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a summer rainstorm in 1996, I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made the water bubble and burst, and the storm's noise drowned out the birds. It was then that I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in a pool. In today's world, everything is labeled and explained, but activities like walking, cycling, and swimming let us experience the wild and mysterious parts of the world. A swimming journey would allow me to explore these mysterious places, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was probably wrong. More recent scientists have shown its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps create a bond between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the visual signal it gives. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing great injustice. Also, tears can come without us wanting them, which can be embarrassing, like when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its exact effects are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are important.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we don't fully understand the global heat balance, making future predictions uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have changed with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection.

Evidence shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution. Researchers use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they are simplifications and have limitations. They are also slow and costly to run. We don't fully understand all climate processes, but we know the system is complex.

Despite these challenges, most agree that climate change will happen faster than before. GCMs help us understand what the future might look like. They predict that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, may become more common.

These changes could affect ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, and the benefits they provide. Resources like food, water, and human settlements are sensitive to climate changes. Some effects might be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts could be positive. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952 due to fewer frosts.

However, many predicted effects of climate warming are negative. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed, concentrating more rain in autumn and winter.

Another concern is changes to glaciers, which will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making transport and exploration easier but increasing iceberg risks. The most visible effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With half the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe flooding and displacement. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face major disruptions. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations might disappear entirely, causing devastating impacts on their people and cultures, and challenging other countries to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 are successful. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are in the right position for a launch is not until 2031. It's a big challenge, but the race is on to create systems with completely new technologies. If these can be developed quickly enough, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art is what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can make it difficult to truly understand art.

Moreover, when art becomes famous and admired over time, it can create fixed ideas that block new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human experiences and conditions that created it and the effects it has on people today. This separation makes it hard to see the broader meaning of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often placed in a separate world, away from other human activities and achievements.

A key task for someone writing about the philosophy of art is to reconnect art with everyday life experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains are connected to the earth, and art theorists should do the same for art.

To truly understand art, we need to step away from the art itself for a while and look at the everyday experiences that we don't usually see as artistic. We need to take a different path to understand art. Just like you can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants, understanding flowers means learning about soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art, we should start with the raw experiences that catch our attention and bring us joy.

Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, comic strips, and news stories without realizing they are forms of art. When art is only seen in museums and galleries, people look for enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the idea of art being only in museums often still separate art from everyday life. The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team. In the evening light, a group of quiet lions suddenly appears and surrounds their prey, like skilled hunters. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, which is to catch their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare away rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be beneficial. If an animal is too generous, others might benefit more than it does. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are often inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a new trend in rock music in the country for the rest of the decade. The old style of serious and plain rock music was replaced by a lighter, more melodic style. The album mixed social observations and strong emotions with sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. It was full of humor and irony, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting different styles and writing versatile songs. They sang about typical English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its deeper, more emotional songs like ""So Low,"" which was about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. ""New Life"" was consistently high quality, with 16 tracks and no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women who had a lot of influence in ancient times. I first heard about them in a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered nine books to Tarquin, the King of Rome, for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three books and offered the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I understood that there was a lesson in this story about salesmanship and life. I was often a lonely child and would ask to play with others but was sometimes refused. My mother advised me to do something interesting so that other kids would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I was interested in, something relevant to my life. I'm not a big traveler, so I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to visit. I'm mostly interested in ruins because I like to travel through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it usually ends up in a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" The person sorting it is often a junior editor or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. They don't have much influence, but they want to find something original. The junior editor hopes to make a name for themselves, and the freelancer wants to keep their job. If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor. Eventually, it will be discussed at a meeting. The editor who supports your novel must explain why it should be accepted, based on its quality and potential sales. They also consider if you, as an author, have long-term potential, which you should mention in your letter. Another important factor is how promotable you are, as a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, it might have been a very tough time for you. The economy was in a recession, which was worse than expected. This recession affected many industrialized countries, including Britain. In 1991, Britain's GDP went down, interest rates were very high, people spent less money, over half a million people lost their jobs, and many homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, especially the vehicle and building industries, which saw a 30% drop.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help improve company profits and were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also had to do more work with smaller budgets, being told that ""less must be more.""

Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies started to focus more on making products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. This shift meant that marketing activities received more attention from management, and some brands began to be marketed more effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, even though it wasn't always the answer.

About half of most marketing budgets were spent on advertising, so advertising professionals felt the pressure. The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the early 1990s were tough. The recession made companies review and often cut their advertising budgets. They also started questioning the value of advertising, wanting to know exactly what they were getting for their money.

Advertising was under scrutiny, and companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work.

Advertising professionals faced the same problem as their clients: doing more with less. The recession made it hard to produce effective advertising. There were also other challenges, like demographic changes, the power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad.

These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider how effective their work was. They needed to make sure more of their advertising was successful. However, finding help to improve was difficult. Companies and agencies were too busy dealing with these challenges to share their strategies, and those who succeeded wanted to keep their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often didn't provide practical advice. They sometimes made advertising seem more perfect than it really was, which didn't help those responsible for making it work."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job that many of us wanted. Being a chef seems difficult: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these things didn't stop me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were hard, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect way to escape from this. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. But my wish to cook was not just because I was a student. It also showed my love for beauty and art. I first saw this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing. I still remember my starter. After that meal, I wanted to thank the chef who made it. I felt happy and light for days. After this, I really wanted to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I changed my student life to prepare for my future in cooking. My history degree felt empty, taking me away from my real goal. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making fancy meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming teacher was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was very strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes, I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high diving board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the echoing voices disappeared, and I felt like I was in silence. I moved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both confusing and interesting. These are people who are drawn to the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains covered in ice and snow; who sail alone in small boats through huge waves; who will eat insects if there is nothing better to eat, and who can live for months in the unknown. It is easy to see these people as strange - and they are - like hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their unusual world is far from our everyday life and can be ignored, we tell ourselves. We can be thankful for our world of microwave ovens and phones, happy that the only risks we face are predictable ones, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural place, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a top sailor, though he is clearly a skilled one. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing gives him exciting stories to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that tells sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he likes this tool, Raban has a simple view of other sailing aids. He thinks the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a 'big change in the relationship between man and sea'. Raban believes that since the compass was invented, about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, so they no longer study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of life, is now just a space. Since the sailor's job is just to stay on course, he can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods. This may be why Raban had time to look so closely at the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books written long ago or in faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can describe situations we thought we were alone in feeling, or express our thoughts with clarity and accuracy that we can't. What was shy and confused in us is clearly expressed in their words, which is even more impressive if the book was written by someone from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during our first days in a new place, or when reading a great book, which shows us interesting things we ignored before. Our mind becomes like a radar, noticing things we didn't see before, like the colors of the sky, the changes in a face, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness about a situation we didn't know we could feel sad about.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but I have added very little. I corrected some mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. I could have made more improvements, but that process would never end. For example, in the second article about China, it seemed likely at the time that the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote the piece to predict this, it would seem like I knew the future, which I didn't. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and trying to understand what had already happened. This is the real story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who only need a ticket to explore it. But I believe that not all travelers are blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been overused, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, when people became more aware of the environment, and tour operators realized that travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the places they visited. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, the ecotourism label includes anything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour motorboat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour involving cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but the lack of rules and a clear definition left many travelers confused about what ecotourism really means.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost the notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't as helpful as it could have been. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one welcoming house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of a full story. I worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, so I added some warnings and guesses. But then I realized this book wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself without too many worries."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, mainly growing because of capitalism in the 1800s and 1900s. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 1500s and 1600s. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Newspaper stories about publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit or a movie. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often with the help of the people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were performing at around the country were starting to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming girls. We had to use secret entrances to the places we played to avoid being mobbed by fans. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by followers. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technology keeps changing our lives at work, home, and during free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. More people can now access music, which meets many human needs. Music is part of every big national event and offers many activities for individuals. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these results need more proof, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in school and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice can help with good study habits and concentration, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the short term.

What about the long term? Will there be changes, and what will they be? I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to more types of music, and new styles will mix different genres. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music, making it easier for people to compose without needing technical skills. However, this might reduce the need for live performances and musicians who only perform live. At the same time, more people of all ages might want to make music themselves, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching should allow more people to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring changes to stay relevant for more people. The curriculum will need to include a wider range of musical skills. Training musicians will be key. They must inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and have communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, this is a chance for music educators to show the quality of music teaching available.

Finally, we need to raise the importance of music. Music is crucial in our lives but often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and disrespect. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichés or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked about her dancing. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote that acting only has life when it's being performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Each play is a new start for an actor, who learns and grows with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next role. This emptiness is often felt in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of youth and maturity. His simple yet confident acting shows he is a top actor. Lester plays a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both strong and likable. His performance is skillful, even if it seems understated. Watch how his body moves, like it's waiting to come alive. Handy, who plays Horatio, gives a similar impression. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting just copying real life, or is it something more? What gives life to these characters on stage?

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly to others and think about the words' effects. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, and find the reason to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize the scene. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or inside. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to start with an open mind and trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. Going to a live performance is special, and the staff should recognize that. It's discouraging if the staff treats it like just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. Everyone should be able to see, hear, and feel involved in the performance. The size and shape of the auditorium are important. It should fit the human voice and body. If the auditorium is too big, it can overshadow the actors. Many theatres from the late 19th century got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. Theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, feel rich with past human presence. You can't please everyone with a play, and you can't predict what the audience will want. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something unexpected and new, or else you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but it also had a big impact on middle-class and older people. It helped create a path for the next group of rock stars, who listened to it and felt that this new, exciting music would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was a must-listen for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Liverpool, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow beneath me collapsed. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between two rocks, and I had broken through it. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only traveled about half a mile. It was clear that I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to help researchers with qualitative research. While a lot has been written about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. Many people find the process of analyzing data mysterious. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about how they analyze their data. The goal was to share insights and understanding of the data analysis process, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden methods more clear. Although this seems simple, it is actually quite difficult. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show he had watched. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't remember much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education is still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it at first, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. Success in Hollywood is measured by how much money a film makes. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make someone a star, but it must make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has grown from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village - small-minded, with limited views - just a part of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, the main topic of conversation is films: how much money they have made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: they work there but live somewhere else. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new form of art. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a flat surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images that were more lasting, more realistic, and more detailed than what painters could make in weeks or months. This worried other artists, and after their initial excitement, art critics argued that photography was not real art. They said that because photography relied on machines, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had discovered a new art form, a new way to express themselves. They used their tools like other artists used brushes and pencils - to show their view of the world, nature, and the people in it.

**Book Illustration**

During the time when book illustrations were in black and white, it was common for every children's book to have some illustrations. This also included many novels for older readers, although this decreased as fewer copies were printed. Children's publishing was still very active, but it was mostly done on a low budget, which led to a lot of average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white collection is a mix of ordinary and valuable pieces, a great place for research or browsing. Some of the best works are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reprints of individual books, new publications about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and the process of appreciating this artistic period is underway. Eventually, a smart publisher will see the opportunity to create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either as exact reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This made people realize that sharing too much online can have negative effects. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering dreams of wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we find out that this world is crowded and risky, and we can get lost in it.

Feeling worried? Maybe, but don't lose hope. There is a guide to this future, created by a brave group of early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of being famous—all before social media existed. These early users, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few young people like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While he was an exhibitionist, his work had a certain beauty that some might even call art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the problem remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you more, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to all the vice presidents, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started blogging again, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are having trouble sleeping and feeling anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books have characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, and sleep problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A top sleep researcher says, ""People sleep less when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""

A sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight hours of sleep. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting.

In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers, pay them, and ask them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures people who worry about electrodes on their heads. The lab is more interested in physical effects. They have a driving simulator to test tired drivers. Volunteers come in the afternoon after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has videos showing them nodding off. Coffee can help; two cups can make a tired person a safe driver for a short time. Dr. Reyner suggests using alertness products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain. But these might also happen when awake and relaxed, so no one is sure. Scientists are certain that women sleep about half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.

In the past, people may have slept differently. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then went back to sleep. This break was a time for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poor benefited most from this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours, changing sleep patterns.

Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western places, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. Continuous sleep is not possible in some tribal societies due to noise, the need to watch fires, and protect against predators. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing 800 dollars, while standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I didn't feel like a real cowboy. As I looked at the Arizona mountains in the morning sun, I realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy from the sky, but that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a dirty bag. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word.

I wished there was an outfit I could wear that made me feel like I belonged, even though I was no longer a racing driver. I loved being a racing driver and was addicted to it, but I can't do it anymore. I wondered what I should do next. I thought I had other options, but they didn't work out. I considered being a commentator for races, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also tried starting a business selling classic cars, but it didn't succeed because nobody was buying.

Being an ""ex"" anything is tough. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a World Champion. Even if I had been a champion, people would only listen for a short time. I don't want sympathy because I had a good career and made money. But I miss driving those powerful racing cars and the excitement of racing. I miss the attention from fans and reporters. Now that I don't race, my phone hardly rings, and I have a lot of free time.

As I looked at the sky, I noticed there were no buzzards, but there were small birds in a cactus nearby. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I realized I had a lot to learn, just like a fake cowboy in fancy boots."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, people like to walk around the city, and if you join them, you will probably hear many different languages. People choose Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and jobs. Some people complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, but it's clear that new residents and the growing tourism industry have helped the city grow and improve. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though the name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still very much a gateway city.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like me, are often not very good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing things we won't get paid for, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because, in our work, we always try to make a big impact, so we lose the natural feeling of writing a letter. Real creative artists, who don't focus on the impact of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this problem. I think the true test of a real artist is their natural understanding of the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal would often come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and those who came later feel envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because the distributors were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film, might do to them. Despite receiving mostly excellent reviews, the film was not a commercial hit. It was television that later made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head both times, but it seemed like she wasn't really listening or understanding. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. I thought it was almost a guilty pleasure, just spending the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back. ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it even beats our basic desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways of saying the same thing."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photos. At that time, taking photos was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how one photo could capture the essence of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, and as long as I had film in my camera, there was a chance. My routine was simple: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for that perfect shot. This had been my way for a long time.

I once got lucky with a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. It became very popular, appearing in newspapers and magazines worldwide. This brief success led me to become a freelance photographer. It seemed like a smart move, but life outside photography didn't go as planned. The mid-1990s weren't as successful as I had hoped, even after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad.

The Vienna job came by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the Vienna project, and they asked me to take over. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go because things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.

They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife during a busy summer, but this time, in cold January, it felt different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos. On the first day, I didn't take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. The weather was cold and set, like the old baroque buildings. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons because I wanted this to be my Vienna. I waited for the right moment to take photos.

The next morning, I was out at dawn. Fresh snow made Stephansplatz look untouched and empty. I wasn't sure how to capture the cathedral in one shot because its spire was tall like a giraffe's neck, but the base was large and heavy. I decided to focus on part of it, hoping to capture something magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even for the pioneers in the 19th century. Watching a photo develop in a dark room feels mysterious, and that sense of mystery stays with you. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't really surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big, expensive show, but rather a unique look into a nearly forgotten part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move by themselves or explore movement has been an important, though often unnoticed, theme in creative work this century. The exhibition includes a wide range of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art, collected by curator Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for a long time. These are presented with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative, making it easy to understand, or because it deals with themes of leisure and escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and clever words, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but others argue that he might seem minor because being popular is not always accepted today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only time will tell his true place in art history.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

Recently, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, showing new trends in unrelated work. But often, it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks that were connected only by being art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but worked together through their differences. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the creativity of art. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from enjoying the dish. Understanding something doesn't stop us from enjoying it; it might even enhance our pleasure. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be questioned. It is also influenced by history. Our preferences are shaped by the values of the society we live in. While no one wants to downplay the importance of instinctive responses to art, the idea that intellectual thought undermines sensory enjoyment is an outdated view from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It didn't feel like a regular stone, but it was beautiful. This is how gold might have become important to early people. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been found by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for copper ores and ways to extract copper from them. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.

**St Ives**

We walked quietly down the winding, cobbled street into the town, carrying our bags and leaning against the strong wind. We tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the windows of the waterfront cottages were shut tight against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. The dark grey skies made visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seem like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through good and bad times are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling can help us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for their behavior and create social groups. Then, we can change things like rainfall or population size and see how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male monkey saw a strange male monkey in nearby trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To stop this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the dominant male gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. This worked well until the dominant male made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while he was calmly walking across open ground, revealing his trick.

**What Cats Catch**

In the English village of Felmersham, people collected the prey caught by their cats. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor calculated that if all cats in Britain caught as much, they would kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this is not realistic because most cats live in towns and catch less prey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird numbers high. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest for a while. Eventually, they swim away, looking tired and almost submerged, but they spend the day grazing on green shoots among the reeds and bulrushes.

**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles 1940**

In 1940, Picasso painted several fish still lifes while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The sea creatures look alive despite their situation. The painting is hard to read because Picasso used a flat pattern of overlapping transparent shapes. The thin paint and cool colors make it look like an underwater world of calm. However, there is tension, as the fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp forms and the chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,"Photography

In the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activities. In this short time, photography has grown in its ability to capture moments in time and space. It lets us see quick moments and both large and tiny things. Photography has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. It has become one of the most important ways to show the human experience.

However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The first pictures go back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early cave paintings were made. They might show real hunting events, serve as magic to increase animals for hunting, act as religious symbols, or simply decorate living spaces. But images have always been a part of human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate images are and their importance in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given images a special place. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it promised to provide a true visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This was a big achievement, as artists had long tried to create such images by hand.

Because cameras seemed so real in showing what we see, people thought everyone could understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even isolated people could understand a photo of the sky. But with the growth of global communication in the late 20th century, we need to ask if photos can really be understood across different cultures. Is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Are we so used to photos that we overlook the skill needed to create them?

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem like a simple way to communicate. This can blur the line between how we see the world and its photographic images. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. This is partly because photography has moved into ""mythic time."" It started as a way to keep records in the 19th century but has now become historical. Photos, once close to the photographer and subject, are now part of history. They reveal much about the people and society that created them.

I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography doesn't just reflect culture; it can inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century brought new ways of seeing through perspective. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Telling someone how to write poetry is tricky. It's like walking through a dangerous area: you need to be spontaneous, but one mistake can ruin everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination and spirit be free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem, while others can write even when they are unhappy. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are correct as long as they are not just copying someone else's rules. It's important to find your own style, listen to your inner voice, and nurture it. One day, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there isn't space for too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a question quickly and keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. Conflict and action should be as strong in a short story as in a novel, but every word must be important in a small space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing what will happen next. They might see one or two moves ahead, which is better than not seeing ahead at all. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. Patterns, called gambits, appear, and they have names like openings, middle games, and end games. In both chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally learn to speak, as we see in young children, but they don't naturally learn to write. Language is found in all societies, past and present. Languages change, but they don't get better: English is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn their language without lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and it improved slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet. Children are naturally good at speaking, but reading and writing are skills that need to be taught carefully. We need to understand how writing works, how children's minds work, and how to connect the two."
CPE_8,"I have never started writing a book with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still alive, I have given them made-up names and taken care to ensure no one recognizes them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, and people will realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be helpful to those writing about my friend. I don't claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for things that matter to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they truly represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but I have taken the freedom, like historians do, to create speeches for people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's okay to make it interesting. The smart reader will see where I used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I started this book with worry is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It's hard to really know people, and I think you can only truly know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't understand them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen before, and if I have written about others in short stories, it's because you can describe characters briefly in them. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see the clear patterns and important figures. Today, there is a particularly complex mix of poetry styles, ways of presenting and teaching poetry, and different ideas about the poet's role in society. 

Broadly speaking, there is a debate in contemporary poetry between two groups. One group consists of serious 'literary' writers who want their poems to be read on the page. The other group includes 'popular' poets who enjoy performing their poems in front of an audience. This division is not strict, and many poets do both.

Public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often expected to perform their work in public, which has mixed results for them. 

For 'pop' poets, who write their poems to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard once. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique can become obvious.

On the other hand, poets who focus on their craft and try to continue the best traditions of poetry may not be appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. These poets might feel pressured to read only their simpler work to connect quickly with the audience, which might not represent their best work.

Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm of the poems. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or already knows the poems.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to help people associate poetry with enjoyment. This way, poetry is seen as something accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's not realistic to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and how they understand history, which can affect the person being interviewed. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the person’s memories are not directly connected to the past. Memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia and later life experiences. Emotions in the testimony might come from later events, not the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science: focusing on the body (physiological) and looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles create behavior. The 'whole animal' approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs, studying how animals like rats and pigeons learn. Ethologists study natural behaviors in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often say their methods are more basic, but understanding every nerve cell doesn't replace studying behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that needs to be studied. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

Students new to social sciences face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of the subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research in textbooks and also how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. We all know about social life from daily experiences, so social sciences might seem like common sense. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses specific study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts are the basic ideas that form the 'logical basis' of the subject, helping social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was a long history of simple building in Greece and Italy, which did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms contributed to later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks. She once misjudged a small bridge, causing all four wheels to leave the ground and land with a big bump. Despite this, Chen was amused when he found out what his wife had been doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange because Chen should have been upset. Instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, leaving early and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly. Even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit this. Lily even overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, which made Mui keep quiet. Chen applauded her. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she preferred to pay a parking fee rather than risk being towed or fined. This carefulness might have reassured Mui. On the way, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror and thought it was best not to worry her.

Lily locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui said he was too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to look at the sea. He held his son on the railing and thought about Man Kee's future. Chen wanted him to have a good education and own many restaurants. The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned his son's career. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. It was a small, old, rusty ship. Chen told Man Kee that it was a special ship for them, one that would take them back home someday. He kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Chen let Man Kee look through the telescope. When Lily tried to look, the view was gone, and all she saw was a white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily only saw seagulls following the ship's path."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I read somewhere that if you look from a deep hole, you can see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but then let go, and I fell into the well. I hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had kind of succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear worried voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and old Arthur. Mother was shouting, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was scared someone would see them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. I couldn't believe no one noticed the water trail. Mother was screaming, and it made me feel guilty. I realized this was more serious than I thought. What started as a clever prank had turned into something that could get me in big trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it. I almost got away with it until Father asked me to repeat my story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after me, so no one could check it. Father looked at me like he was seeing me for the first time. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me with pity, not because of my adventure, but because he saw through my lie and worried about my character. His look was as painful as Father's words, showing me that my actions were wrong."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. The house was beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbor. Susan remembered the years spent there with her children growing up.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked how they would bring the house home. Now, Robert was there to help with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Her daughter Francesca was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano carefully.

Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't look like she was going to cry. He explained that many people cry when they see their home being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place. Susan could understand this feeling.

Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to lift the piano into the house. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months.

Now, Susan was less mobile and found it hard to climb the stairs. She realized she should have warned the movers about the piano, but it was too late. Fred reassured her that they only had the piano left to move. Susan felt emotional, realizing how much the objects in the house meant to her now that they were being moved.

As the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out of the house, Susan, Robert, and Francesca started laughing with relief. They laughed so much that they cried tears of laughter. As they walked down the path for the last time, Susan felt happy, with only tears of laughter in her eyes."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism For Everyone**

**Is do-it-yourself literary criticism just harmless fun?**

From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or start a music channel online. In practice, though, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that was truly opened to everyone was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could say what they liked about a book and give it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and when a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought of a book, rather than just reading the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon had the most customers and attracted the most reviews, which also led to some problems. 

This open system allowed for some mischief. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day, so it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors checked that reviews followed the company's guidelines. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks on the author, or those with bad language, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous and reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This meant there was room for trouble. For example, writers could give their own books great reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews his first novel received, so he wrote some positive ones himself. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to post friendly messages hoping people would buy and enjoy their book. Some even shared their email addresses to invite readers to contact them. However, Amazon did not check if these comments really came from the author, except for famous writers. A lesser-known writer once pretended to be John Updike and wrote a fake comment, which was removed.

The real drama came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit,"" about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well-received by the mainstream press. But many people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon's page to express their anger. Dozens of critical reviews were submitted but disappeared a few days later. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of people reading and writing reviews as good for business. Since readers' reviews were meant to be a ""forum to talk about a book"" rather than a chat room, Amazon closely monitored bestselling books to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page for a less popular book. ""The Story about Ping,"" a classic children's book about a duck named Ping, inspired much humor because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One long review compared the book's plot to Internet architecture and concluded it provided a ""good high-level overview"" of basic networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare. Most reader reviews on Amazon.com were taken seriously by their writers and provided a surprisingly accurate idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once complained that reviewing too many books meant inventing reactions to books he had no real feelings about. This is why the democratization of the review process can be seen as a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must be different from others. We often praise art for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to modern art, we sometimes hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, or that their work is not art anymore. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be confusing and new. We don't always see the old themes and methods in today's art. We think artists should be different from everyone else, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and it was part of everyday life. Today, we let artists do what they want and get upset if they try to be more like us.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the many different kinds of pictures. The artist then asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any fancy style. My question is: Is this finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th

Usually, when a painter finds success in one style, they stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep doing the same thing, and trying something new can upset people. Gallery owners like safe choices, and art buyers often want the comfort of familiarity. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully try new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something different. He is known for his still life paintings but is now painting scenes from the London Underground. Rimmington has always been interested in railways. In the 1980s, he drew pictures of the railway land at King's Cross Station. Now, he has moved underground to explore what happens there. His new show, ""Underground Encounters,"" includes 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique world of the London Underground.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I don't know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would come to such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to say it that way. Except for an old woman who comes from the village each day to clean, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in memories. I talked about how art seems useless but didn't mention its comforts. The comfort of creating art is that it allows us to change reality and show its true meaning. Our everyday actions are like a rough cloth hiding the beautiful pattern underneath. For artists, art is a way to deal with the things that hurt or defeated us in life. It helps us fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"Title: Family Business

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays. 

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. 

""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to act confident. ""Couldn't that be useful?""

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand a lot of information quickly, you can talk well, and you like performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see in TV dramas.""

""Anyway,"" he said, pulling himself together, ""I feel your heart's not going to be in the family business now. You'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""

Like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, and he was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you have the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theaters, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate decisions and especially to avoid my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused and used these last days wisely, he might be right. I felt ready, confident, and focused.

But that was not to be. My father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last job for him. It was the most important work the family business had ever done, and he promised it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that my father couldn't understand this pressure (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need. That wasn't all. As he explained the job, I saw more clearly than ever his determination - the clarity and skill with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his way, he was a genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with their money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency after having twins. She even got a raise, making her salary thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who really wanted to move, and Simon didn't argue much. She felt their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She wanted a prestigious address for their careers. Mornington Mansions didn't fit the image of a successful barrister and businesswoman. Lois decided they needed to save money, so one of them had to use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he stayed as a boy. His grandmother always made sure his grandfather, a lawyer, was comfortable after work. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. They needed both salaries to maintain their lifestyle. Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset. She accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a case four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial sounded weak even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered being punished as a child. He wished he had been prepared and said something different. Venetia's anger and disgust confused him. He wondered why she was so upset and if she had the right to ruin his career. If the rumor spread, he knew his career would be over."
CPE_36,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops start to recognize you, even if you don't feel like you're living a real life. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about summer, but tonight I'm watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back plants. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested. I have her latest book now. 'How's the writing going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work so much,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't really want her in the garden, which now looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'I should've been a teacher. Writers don't get holidays. They say those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What are your plans for the holidays?' she asks. 

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days, hot streets, and loneliness in the park. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she will be around. 'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun,' I lie. I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her so. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say, sounding old-fashioned. 'Get a life, Ann,' Jaz replies. 

I do have a life. I work, go out, and read on the tube. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calming. Then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, 'I've had my moments.' We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it helps people and communities feel connected to the past. We often feel linked to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and their stories. But there is also a need to learn about our broader past to understand our future, both individually and as a nation. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the future by understanding the past. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There might be parts of our national heritage we don't like, but it is still part of us, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being. It influences everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we connected with our history through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society broke up communities, and much of this oral tradition has been lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became very important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I picked the Fens because they seemed plain and empty, a perfect setting for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, there is a place that feels foreign to many English people, even though other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open yet mysterious. While writing my novel, I didn't explore the Fens extensively. I haven't been to places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than rely on facts. Imagining the Fens has its own logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more than that. Displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer a chance to see and learn from items that existed and had meaning in history. This is what makes them different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that create exciting and accessible displays and programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real things that only museums can offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly now that they affect most of us. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that people who have lived through events like world wars are more interested in preservation because stability becomes important. If there is a need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell smart products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem different from everyday life. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking basic ideas like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this by saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would hint at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of these books as 'boys' books', he did manage to get us to read some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. People who lived in dangerous places with scary animals made desperate sounds, and some languages still have words that echo this, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of these odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. But recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, even though philosopher John Locke thought of language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode looks at the skill of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written and shared in ways that make them last only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only relevant for as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in, which could be a day, a week, or at most a month. The short life of reviews often affects how people see their importance. Many people, including the writers, think that reviewing is a job done for reasons like needing money or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. It's one thing to be quick and fair in a short newspaper review of six to eight hundred words, and another to write a detailed piece of six to eight thousand words for international journals. Writing a fifteen hundred-word article for weekly magazines combines challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only thing to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer also needs to know a lot about many topics and write in a way that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews, even short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think less famous writers should accept that their reviews are temporary, but if they can, they should be allowed to keep a record of their work, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, it's common for the same people to do both reviewing and literary study. In the past, other academics criticized professors who reviewed for showing off or wasting time, but now it's more accepted. Complaints from non-professors that professors are taking their jobs are also less common, partly because there is more reviewing work available and partly because the pay is often low. I believe these arrangements are good for readers, who can trust the reviewer knows what they're talking about, and for professors, as it helps them stay connected to a wider audience. It reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. Finally, reviewing should be a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and felt a brief moment of doubt about owning it, even after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excitedly, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or a blinking light on the answering machine when he got home. He was glad the windows weren't broken and nothing was stolen, but he wondered what it would look like if it had been. 

From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to spending three or four evenings alone at home each week. Once he left the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to question why he did these things. His thoughts and feelings seemed unclear and disconnected. 

There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel so powerless. If he had realized his own value, he might have escaped his situation. But he was eager to settle down and followed the first opportunity that came along. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs his friends talked about and followed their paths, not imagining he could find a job that would make him happy. He went to one job interview and didn't think much about whether the job was right for him. It was an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would have to attend. Neil offered him the job right away, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, but I tried hard to find a good spot. A part of the area was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track where the goats would run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since the morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the torch batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we moved on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues to think of difficult questions the audience might ask. Also, create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly when making mayonnaise, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things it does very quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads, but some mental tasks cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or get more complicated, like the fishing line. 

The mind has different speeds for different tasks. Sometimes, we need to react instantly without thinking. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe before I even realized what was happening. This fast reaction is a type of intelligence called 'wits'. 

Then there is thinking, which involves figuring things out, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine or a student working on an assignment uses this kind of intelligence, which we call 'intellect'. People who are good at this are often called 'bright' or 'clever'.

There is also a slower way of thinking that is more relaxed and dreamy. This happens when we are lost in thought, like sitting by the sea or just before falling asleep. This slow thinking is just as important as fast thinking. It helps us understand complex or unclear situations. 

Recent studies show that this patient, less deliberate way of thinking is good for dealing with complicated problems. When we don't know what questions to ask or when the issue is too subtle, we need this slow thinking. For example, deciding how to manage a difficult group at work or whether to change careers might be better solved by pondering rather than rushing for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom.

Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast, deliberate thinking and have valued these slower ways of knowing. Scientists are now exploring these slower, less deliberate ways of thinking. They find that the unconscious mind can learn complex patterns, understand complicated situations, and solve difficult problems if given time."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It's a friendly and well-supplied base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure about which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, and anxious like I was in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for my occasional sadness is not about losing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him here or there, he shook hands with me politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to like me more. One day, he sent me a note inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, because my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with guesses, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and he didn't explore his own screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Today, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. People always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. We do not let anything disturb this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also do not like waiters being too friendly. I know most of the guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Respect for privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

A special production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a negative review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona affects the story, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include Cassio's dangerous games with other young officers and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to cry during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension are fantastic throughout. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the middle of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except for a huge hidden freshwater lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that some scientists are getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the age-old search for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know if what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too much sugar and preservatives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And few people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had vandalized the office. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she wasn't going to help with the office. She believed he was like a visitor from another world, not from her familiar Brooklyn streets.

**KAREN**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor later told her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed as a reminder of her past suffering. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's exciting to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly throat infections, which were her only health issues. She valued how he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This quality made him very loved by the village. He was always ready to give his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Joanna MacGregor's performances are exciting, even for those who think they can't appreciate music. Watching her play is like seeing someone push the limits of what a pianist can do. However, at a recent concert for children, one boy was not impressed until she played the theme from ""Match of the Day."" For him, that was the real test of her skills.

Joanna MacGregor is unique among top pianists because she cares about how young children learn the piano. She has published her own beginner piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" She managed to do this despite her busy schedule, which includes participating in many festivals and running her own recording label, Sound Circus. She also loves collaborating with other artists.

Why did she decide to write a book? Joanna believes that the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks that the music profession often focuses too much on creating child prodigies, while most people just want to enjoy music. She finds this everyday interest in music more fascinating.

Joanna's experience comes from teaching beginners when she was younger and from watching her mother teach piano to many children. She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children learn quickly, but she is more interested in those who take their time and enjoy the process, even if they eventually stop.

She worries that some parents push their children to achieve in music, like in sports, rather than letting them enjoy it. Children often quit because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations.

Joanna's books are not the only ones designed to make learning fun, but she adds a special touch by including a storyline in the books and CDs. She believes learning should be fun and encourages children to improvise and explore the piano.

As children progress, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes practice is the most important thing. She didn't practice seriously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she had to practice a lot to handle difficult pieces. Now, she enjoys practicing and sees it as the core of her musical life.

Joanna advises that whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, you should know what you want to achieve. She suggests rewarding yourself by playing a whole piece, even with mistakes, and mixing hard pieces with easy ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is usually not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is difficult to achieve. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard. Writing slowly helped me think more carefully. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with more care. On the other hand, using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's incredible they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the tray closed. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches were invented after lighters, we would think they were a great improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of thinking is called chronocentricity, which means believing your generation is at the center of history. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. So far, that prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so most people don't do it. Also, computers encourage people to read only small parts of texts. Some people say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but non-linear reading is not new. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What is new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw everything perfectly organized. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was put down, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could change any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot things because he wasn't supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that if he stayed away, things would get out of control. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being overwhelmed with work and having no parking space at the office.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It was an ""Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis; he wanted a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, and Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from friends. Ian was proof that friends often become less reliable.

Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder, knowing Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt like it had no real conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But Ian had already received a large advance, which was against the usual business practice of paying authors after they deliver a manuscript.

Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers had quickly taken over British theatre, but Ian's energy seemed unmatched. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them personally. Yet, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While others succeeded, Ian became more difficult. He was supposed to edit an arts magazine but never published an issue, using up the budget for twelve. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased to try to make him work more.

At editorial meetings, Ian was witty but critical, often dismissing others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable, even for his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to admit that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"England's Breakfast Change

Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is a relatively new idea in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common for everyone. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. However, they might not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns could explain why breakfast became more important. People started working for set hours, often starting very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their skills, personal opinions, and experiences, as well as social and cultural rules. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photo, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might understand the photos they see, but instead of just accepting them, we might ask if the photo truly shows what the scene looked like at that moment. Or, does it show the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete confidence in themselves. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sports. There is only one way to be the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me self-discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows you to shine individually, but it is a team game, so you must balance both. It's like life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot - not just money. It has opened opportunities for me and shown me things around the world that others may never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so memorable that they stand out clearly in our minds. For me, one such moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was lying awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical change came through the open window where I lay listening, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Birds have always been important in human culture. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is hitting the glass. Wrens are seen as mysterious birds, sometimes thought to bring messages or signs. Is this wren trying to tell me something, or is it just trapped? Both ideas could be true, depending on how you see it. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens still hold a special place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because many birds are part of our folklore, which goes back to when people relied more on nature for survival. People developed a way of understanding the world through the behavior of animals. This understanding can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London, seen as helpful because it cleaned the streets. But later, it was seen as a pest and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain. Our connection with birds is not just cultural; it is part of our nature. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn of danger, bad weather, or food. Birds also connected people to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and wish to have. Some people might say these feelings are old and not needed now, but they are still part of us. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings, representing love and magic. Losing them is like losing a part of our history. However, birds not mentioned in stories or folklore are often ignored when they disappear. Folklore is important because it keeps stories and feelings about birds alive, more than scientific terms can. These stories help us connect with birds in a way that science cannot explain. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to describe with science. Birds engage us in ways we don't fully understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and the past, holding a mystery that keeps us curious."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map is a tool that shows how different places and features on Earth relate to each other. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like saying ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. 

Direction is another important part of maps, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, exact direction wasn't always the most important thing. Because of this, written travel guides were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, might not show true directions. Early maps also used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs could be different sizes to show how important they were. The style of these signs changed depending on the map's purpose and where it was made. So, when looking at old maps, it's important to understand the style used.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about making maps more accurate in showing distance and direction and adding more details. To do this, cartographers used other sciences. For example, instead of using the sun or stars to find direction, they used the magnetic compass. They also developed tools to measure angles accurately. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it. Astronomers found out that Earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flat at the poles, which made mapping large areas more precise.

Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps, especially with the use of artillery, to understand the land better. This led to the invention of contour lines to show elevation. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps for their work. Today's map makers, or cartographers, create maps showing many things, like geological layers, climate, and land use. The value of maps in many sciences has led to a modern revival of map-making.

The development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change. Sometimes old ideas stayed around even when new ones were available. Cartographers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since it was easy to copy old maps, and because of the cost of printing, map publishers were sometimes slow to accept new ideas. Therefore, maps should not always be seen as perfect evidence of what people knew at the time.

The many maps we have today are the result of much work and thought. They are a valuable record of human history and make the study of historical maps both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"I was invited into a young man's living room, which felt like a calm and cultured place compared to the messy rooms around it where his less ambitious family members stayed. Moving from the kitchen to his living room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. In his room, I saw the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprisingly, a teenager who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months free before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as crazy; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me, although I might have felt differently if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy goal for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I was willing to try. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' record collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and showing him a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with him. Even if we didn't succeed in musical theatre, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and might need new songs. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, my brief certainty of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber faded a bit. I would keep looking at ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs that didn't show my voice's limitations, but it seemed likely I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and write lyrics like musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I soon returned to his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages named after him. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't really excite me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the project was unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and not entirely wrong. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which were probably thought up by his previous lyricist friend. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have an amazing ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk naturally, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders didn't learn web-making from a special spider school; it's something they just know how to do.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can change the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which have a huge variety of species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together make up the climate, happen because large masses of air rise and mix. The atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the air is on a spinning Earth, and it doesn't move as fast as the planet. The sun is an even more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks, but I was most worried about making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning a lot about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to make a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it looked, and I thought I might be sent back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get good at it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These should be easy for the camera to show, as it can display a whole artwork and then zoom in to see details. However, there are few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a reliable critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I thought the series would focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the prices of rare metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being mined, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its nearby small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**

The Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a unique experience where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame over a weekend. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the UK's only bamboo bike-building course. 

Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, these bikes can be expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable and accessible, so they started their own business. They realized they didn't just want to sell bikes; they wanted to share the joy of making them. 

The Bamboo Bike Club is more like a community project than a business. James and Ian both have full-time jobs—James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can design and build your own bike frame for a competitive price.

On the first day of the course, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make solid joints. You start by assembling the front triangle of the bike with 40 mm bamboo tubes, then move on to the seat and chain assembly. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. 

Building the bike requires some technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help. They supervise every step and will assist if you find a task too difficult. Most participants enjoy the challenge of building their own bike, and many are engineers. But even if you're not, Ian assures that it's okay to make mistakes. You can always try again with a new piece of bamboo.

On the second day, you focus on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. After a final waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian has used his bamboo bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without any issues.

Bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they have a unique charm. They are perfect for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making them comfortable to ride. 

The best part? The whole experience costs less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how men and women can communicate better is very popular in the self-help industry. This industry is growing fast and claims to help Americans improve their lives. It also benefits from people's desires to improve, creating more needs and supporting the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books that might seem exaggerated or not very serious. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are always looking for the next big hit, focusing on how marketable a book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions and admits, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's most of the work done. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers might leave out things they find too embarrassing or unimportant. There are also more complex reasons for not telling the whole truth. An autobiographer might think that inventing stories can show the truth about themselves better than sticking to the facts. Or they might decide from the start not to follow the truth. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without being cynical.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Experts say detective stories became popular because they reflect the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it shows how society can work smoothly again. In Hammett's stories, society returns to its old ways, but it is shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The detective is both a crook and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his connection to the criminal, and sometimes his desire to punish is stronger because of this connection.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To talk about writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said, ""I couldn't write about a place like this. Trollope might, but he knew the culture. Knowing the culture is important for a writer. Science is like its own civilization. Only scientists can present it well. If you don't understand the community and its rules, you can't do it well."" One of Gould's rules is to never underestimate the reader. ""Don't make it too simple,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but not the argument. If readers feel they are being talked down to, your piece is ruined."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. This is because the gym has used too much air-conditioning to handle the unusually high temperatures this summer. At quiet times, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It has become a key part of our work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep out heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is not surprising that as we start a new millennium, people are interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping clocks accurate. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations—interesting but outdated in our modern world. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks their charm is in their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I used to think china-painting was only for serious, experienced artists. I once saw older women at an arts and crafts show painting teacups with perfect flowers. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed like they had been practicing for years or had a special talent. So, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners also have natural skill? In reality, the class was not intimidating at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly and perfectly as I remembered."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent told them that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland. 

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe there was a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed. 

When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they arrived at the hotel, and they were too tired to question it. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday and got worried. 

The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly explained there was a mistake and they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn’t know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. 

A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, came over. Dawne explained they were in the wrong hotel. Keith said they followed the wrong group. Mrs. Franks explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and it was easy to mix them up. She laughed and said it was impossible to end up in a wildlife park by mistake. 

Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, remembering everything that happened. 

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, talked to them, saying they had a great night's sleep. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn’t mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had even said so when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**He Was a People Person**

American business leaders are now looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a great example of good management. Eluned Price reports.

In Britain, most people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, in America, he has only recently become well-known. The Wall Street Journal once described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are very enthusiastic about him. Many biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the ship Endurance are being written and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a movie about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have started to see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and learn lessons about leadership and communication from his story. They even use the term ""speaking Shackleton"" to describe their approach. Shackleton, known for being determined and resourceful, has become a model for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has been inspired by Shackleton for years. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises, like when a company's plant explodes or when many employees have to be let go. MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great example of leadership and communication. Shackleton was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of his most important decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole in 1908. This decision showed his credibility because he prioritized the lives of his men.

In a crisis, MacGregor says, people want to know someone is in charge. Unlike many managers today who avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Shackleton told his men they would reach safety if they trusted him and did their best. From their diaries, it's clear that Shackleton was always in control.

Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and ready to start over if needed. MacGregor's company uses Shackleton's story to teach principles that clients can relate to without feeling criticized.

Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that in America, people often want quick solutions, but sometimes doing nothing is the hardest but best choice. For example, if you buy bonds and the interest rates change, waiting might be better than selling at a loss. Similarly, if a new product isn't successful, it's okay to stop selling it.

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, without gloves. Shackleton gave him his own gloves, insisting he wear them. He did the same with a biscuit during a previous expedition when they were starving, showing his selflessness.

Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says that the public's interest in heroic stories is growing. Shackleton represents the ideals we long for today, standing out as a true hero."
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects.

Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her daughter Annabelle. He wanted to see if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood's surface, like holes where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several small holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the holes with food, showing they didn't need to see surface holes to find the insects. They also didn't rely on smell or sound, as they could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked or the insects were dead and silent.

Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes could sense empty spaces inside the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and listens with its large ears. Dr. Erickson thinks the aye-aye uses echo-location, listening for sounds that show a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye replaces woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting, but there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we really know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories often give us only small, incomplete pieces of their past. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they still only show part of the story.

Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed, telling the stories of ordinary people, not just the famous. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People have interesting lives and want to share them, not just for their children or future generations, but for themselves too. They enjoy the process.""

The promise of privacy helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune said, ""I was surprised at what I shared. Some things were painful, like my divorce."" He did it for his family, hoping they might learn something, but hasn't let his children read it yet. ""If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone.""

Ms. Renier notices that many people repeat patterns from their childhood. ""It's amazing how much parents influence their children,"" she says. ""People often marry someone their parents would approve of, or do the opposite to rebel."" Many people still feel disappointed about things with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some want to say, ""I can't stand my mother.""

Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an investigator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes share things and then doubt if it should be included. I put it in, and they can decide later. But usually, people want to be honest.""

""It's not about showing off. It's about remembering the past. Things are changing fast, and we are losing touch with history. This gives us roots and a connection to our ancestors because families don't stay together as they used to. People want a little immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the book's binding. The final product is high quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost stops many people. ""I thought it would be more affordable,"" she says. ""But my clients are often wealthy, the kind who might have had portraits painted for their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of the sculptures are real; they are all accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together here. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and from all over the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, belonging to Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728), with nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens in their original early 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, showing major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern use.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection has over 400,000 air photographs, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos throughout Great Britain. The photos are interesting as they show detailed records of the landscape, including natural environments and human activities from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with questions. The photos cannot be borrowed, but copies can be bought. These are made to order and usually take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world and is a unique tourist attraction. You can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, called facsimiles, to preserve the originals while allowing people to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates were an alternative to tomb statues and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**

I have had 35 years of being around small children because of my unusual personal life, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I fed the baby, and for me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I have become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and clothes. This has been very helpful for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy building my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I'm sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling shy. I think it's an advantage that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if there are facilities for the kids to come with me. This way, they know what I do when I'm not with them, and they don't feel like I'm disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about being a father. I made big efforts to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other so they could come and go as they wanted, but I think it was confusing for them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too liberal. I think I could have been more organized. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just another parent. It's a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her and it goes away. A baby's smile is the best way to make you feel better. It can melt a grown man."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular airplane. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, similar to a Boeing 707 passenger plane. But inside, it was different. The 13 students from Europe and America were about to have an unforgettable flight. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except a few at the back, where the nervous students sat. For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight, offered by the European Space Agency. They had to propose creative experiments to be done in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride.

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, going up and then diving down. The goal was to create a weightless state at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued to rise before gravity pulled it back down. In those few silent seconds between going up and falling, everything inside became weightless. The students would feel closer to the moon than the Earth.

The plane took off smoothly, but soon it was clear this was no regular flight. The pilot made the Boeing climb at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and we were thrown across the cabin floor. Then the engines stopped, and we were weightless almost immediately. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence. The floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We floated aimlessly; directions like left, right, up, or down no longer made sense. Only gravity helps us understand where we are.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned, but not as quickly as it disappeared, causing some students to land with a bump. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released the device, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using a remote control. However, another student accidentally landed on it during a rough return to gravity.

Next to the robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by no gravity, thinking about future space stations. Another team from Utah State University looked at making solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by sunlight. They tried to create these films in microgravity, believing that satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.

I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees sounded great to me. I was excited, and the rest of the family became enthusiastic too. We started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the entire 70 acres.

In 1968, it was a very rainy winter in New Zealand. It rained almost every day while we were planting, and I was often wet and cold. Every morning, I had to prepare for planting again. I would get out of the Land Rover, feeling warm and dry, but the rain would start, and my clothes were still damp from the day before. My boots were wet, and my hands struggled with slippery laces. During this time, I had many thoughts and reflections about life.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. We used a planting bag filled with as many trees as possible. It was heavy at first, but it got easier as it became lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. We decided on the spacing for the trees and used three poles to line them up. Once in line, we planted all the way down and then turned around to come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, planting became automatic. I developed a rhythm and used the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs, where you train your body to do standard moves, making the work easier. You take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, plant it, stamp it in, and move on.

Mentally, it was interesting. My mind wandered, and I had many thoughts about the natural world and our place in it. These ideas have influenced my life since then. I've returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which is satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.

In 1984, I took a break from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. I stayed in a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. I still feel a strong connection to that area. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth, and it's a powerful bond."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

When one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box, I wondered what was inside. My husband Derek and I have been running an 'open farm' in Somerset for six years, where we care for orphaned animals. The noise from the box was unfamiliar, so I was curious to look inside. I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky-colored eyes on their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If they become orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three cubs were discovered by builders who accidentally dug into their home while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still nursing her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to mimic their mother's licking. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. They seemed content with each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum'.

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, even though he was eating normally. It was a warning sign I didn't recognize, and the next morning, I found him dead. The vet's post-mortem showed Willow died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. Disheartened by my failure, I continued caring for the others. Then, six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. The area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. He was about two weeks younger than the females and difficult to feed. I had to move the bottle's teat around in his mouth to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything. Willow II was different. He gave up the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods.

At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, the cubs became nocturnal and went for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other's tails. As 'human badgers,' we joined in the fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, didn't and sometimes got bruised. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, as badgers are territorial and can kill intruders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we secured the gate with sheet metal. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a campaign to build a sett for them on the farm. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walking direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they preferred the sett to walking, enjoying the tunnels and arranging bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of it, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I checked on them and saw three badgers asleep in their chambers. These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she has joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before heading off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley to study compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was mapping the 'variations of the compass', now called 'declination'. Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't accurately use their compasses to find their way across the oceans. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at the time, set out to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip to the Cape Verde Islands was cut short due to problems with the crew, but he tried again. This second journey took him to places like Rio de Janeiro and Newfoundland before returning to England. In 1701, Halley published a map showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it outdated.

Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the route of Halley's ship, the Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. Halley was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions and did research in geophysics. He even helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous work, Principia Mathematica.

Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. Dr. Clark will take the same measurements Halley did, but with more accurate tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. Dr. Clark explains that measuring the direction of the magnetic field requires knowing true north, which they can find using global positioning satellites. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the expedition. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.

Halley's journey was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian made a naval captain for this purpose. Dr. Clark has the experience needed for this journey, having spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. The expedition will have four stages with different crews. Dr. Clark is committed to the project, saying, ""I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This behavior puzzled Charles Darwin because, in a world where survival is tough, it seemed strange that birds would evolve such extravagant tails. How do they manage to survive with such a burden?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying these peacocks to find answers, a century after Darwin's time. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the fittest survive and reproduce. However, he thought the peacock's tail was an exception and suggested a different idea called 'sexual selection.' He believed females chose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He thought that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a reason. Perhaps these males had other qualities that helped them survive, even if humans couldn't see them.

Today, the debate continues because studying peafowl behavior is challenging. At Whipsnade, 200 peacocks live in conditions similar to the wild, providing a unique chance to study them. Petrie and her team are focusing on two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have other advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it just about looks, as Darwin thought?

Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. These males attract more mates. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy males might be healthier and free of parasites, but this hasn't been tested in Whipsnade peacocks yet.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males. She wants to see if the offspring of attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

There's another interesting theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' He proposed that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit the tail, and daughters will inherit the preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to males with very long tails, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on design changes from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly anchored in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. Some might think I'm a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses the charm of old boat designs, but modern technology made it easier to build.

However, modern technology often protects sailors from the tough realities of life at sea, which is what many seek when they go sailing. I'm not saying sailors should suffer, but I believe boats should have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. But why sail if every sail sets and furls itself automatically? Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of the adventure. Also, why move the steering from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot in the middle? The sad reason is to create a cabin with more space, like an ocean liner. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house.

When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the former owner said it had comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned he was right. Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I've ever sailed. But classic boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized I had to let Hirta go. I couldn't find a suitable new boat, so I decided to build one from scratch.

The Westerman has never let me down. Designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design, but Irens first sketched the boat on a napkin. Later, they used a computer to refine the design. They even carved a model, like in the old days. We reviewed the model and made changes on the computer. The final design was perfect. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully at sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed wood, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed as a sailing boat first, without focusing on furniture. This traditional method works well. The Westerman shows that you don't need to follow trends to be happy and that history can teach us valuable lessons. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a classic wooden boat."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are doing very well. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was happy to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined body conditioning classes and many others like stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The one-hour facial made me feel like a new person. The staff in the treatment rooms were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to visit again. This is the perfect break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this grand home was clear from the moment I walked up the large staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and lots of space, so you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I'm healthy. However, I was impressed when a shoulder problem found during the check-up was quickly shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and an extra individual session. Each person gets a specific diet to follow. I lost weight without fasting, but I was hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My typical daily menu was grapefruit and honey, hot lemon and boiled water for breakfast; a choice of salads for lunch; and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you're not fasting or on a light diet, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and nicely presented, so you don't suffer too much! You get a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a lovely old manor farm with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're watching your calories, you'll have to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delightful creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, so I could work off some of the tempting treats. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you really want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice on an old, sometimes painful, shoulder injury. The physiotherapist recommended good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-rated restaurant, has dishes that are hard to resist. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu; the choices were amazing. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed a happy woman! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other reports my fellow journalists would write, about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone and firm the body. Cliveden has all these if you want to use them—before enjoying yourself at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's the most delicious I've ever tasted. It's the worst because it's a large piece with 360 calories, which isn't good if you want to lose weight. You've been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose the relaxing oils blend, fell asleep twice during the massage, floated back to my room, and had my most refreshing night's sleep in years. The place is modern and purpose-built, efficiently run, with up-to-date facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are plenty of therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people—from entire football teams to mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still more than 98% the same as chimps. On a big evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is a recent change. Our ability to make art and do other things we think are uniquely human must come from a small part of our genes. This is a lot to expect from just a few genes. It's not surprising that studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are actually shared with animals, just in different degrees. For example, both humans and animals like chimpanzees and sea otters use tools. Chimps use sticks to eat and as weapons, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic gift, it's strange that our ancestors didn't make art for most of the 7 million years since they split from chimps. The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't know for sure because those materials don't last. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments, only appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago.

If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from similar animal works? Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it's made for beauty, and it's learned, not instinctive. Let's look at these claims.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means human art doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art can communicate thoughts or feelings, it's not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps defend territory or attract a mate, which helps pass on genes. By this measure, human art seems different.

The second claim is that only human art is made for aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, so they probably don't sing just for pleasure. Again, human art seems unique here.

The third difference is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing their species' song. A French baby raised in Japan wouldn't spontaneously sing the French national anthem. Human art changes quickly, unlike animal behaviors. For example, geese honked 2,000 years ago just like they do today, but human art styles change fast. Even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and most of their paintings sold, which many human artists can't claim.

These paintings by chimps blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, the ape paintings weren't made for practical reasons but for the painter's satisfaction. You might say human art is different because it's meant to communicate, but even some famous human art was made for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"Title: A Big Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story. Today, there are not many big adventures or heroes left. In the past, children's stories often featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes focused on the far horizon as they traveled into the unknown. Nowadays, such people are rare in both fiction and real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore led a team across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored places on earth. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', and locals call it the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of this incredible journey from the comfort of his home. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. Surprisingly, the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were actually long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and put the expedition at risk.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's toughest deserts. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something to himself. 'I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to find out who Charles Blackmore really was, outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took us 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading about their crossing might wonder why he used the word 'kind'. The team faced many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and losing part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's famous sandstorms. And we never faced the freezing desert cold that could have stopped us completely. That's not to say we didn't face challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often fell over onto us.'

'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn't allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very worried about my physical ability. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" At that moment, I was very scared.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've gone through so much; you've come so far. We were very thin but strong and muscular despite being exhausted. My body was in great shape, and my legs were like machines. I could walk over anything.'

In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the difficulty it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I doubt myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to do that. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than anything else I've done. But in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- compared to that, the desert doesn't measure up.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I long for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the purpose of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it hard now to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Life was becoming too hectic for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand again. Everyone loves technology because it gives us amazing gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. However, we've been subtly convinced that technology is essential, and that's okay. But is it really? Using our hands doesn't harm the environment, unlike machines. A recent problem with my word processor, which cost a lot to fix, made me think that gadgets might not be worth the trouble or expense. Are we as dependent on technology as we think? Gradually, I've been letting household gadgets go as they break down. This makes me question what ""extra time"" technology really gives us. Is it just more time to buy more gadgets? If so, the marketers have tricked us. When my machine started making strange noises, even when unplugged, I left it in the backyard. Now, I'm not stuck to a noisy machine, and I can take my time sewing by hand. I was always a bit scared of electric machines that move quickly towards your fingers. Plus, I can easily take my sewing with me anywhere. Of course, there are some gadgets I wouldn't want to live without. A year without a washing machine showed me how useful it is. But losing some gadgets has been surprisingly nice. We were watching too much TV, so I returned the rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. It's hard on the eyes but makes us focus on what's worth watching. Now, we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I stopped using my old sewing machine. It's now a plant stand, and I can't afford a new one, so I sew by hand. We've come to believe we can't live without technology, and even if we resist the idea, we don't want to give it up. We feel sorry for past generations who had to work hard without machines. Computers now do amazing calculations and entertain us. But sewing by hand is not boring; it's relaxing. I can sew and listen to the radio or talk with family and friends. If it's a simple task, I can watch TV and feel less guilty about sitting in front of it. It's nice to sit by the fire and sew with a cup of tea. I used to think sewing by hand was hard and tiring, but it's actually soothing and satisfying to see my work improve. Things get done quickly, and life slows down to my own pace. I'm also free from the rush of modern life, where we hurry from one task to another. I've even started enjoying washing dishes by hand, dreaming while I do it. Now, I look around the house and wonder if we really need the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. We could save a lot of money by not using electric lights!"
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. When I visit his workshop in East London, he seems to be in a hurry. He greets me quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It's not clear if he's naturally brusque or just shy. His workshop is busy, filled with half-made furniture and colorful planks of wood. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a great reputation. He always has orders for months ahead, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen unit, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one like Hurst, who focuses on clean, simple designs, is rare. Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are keys to his success. He is confident in his skills, saying, ""I have a huge natural ability."" He learned his craft by asking the right questions and learning on his own.

Most of Hurst's work comes from private clients, and some return for more pieces. He finds it satisfying to furnish a whole house. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know what they want. Hurst also praises others when deserved, saying there are better craftsmen than him. He criticizes those who take too long to make one piece and those who try to make fashion statements with furniture. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and useful.

Despite his confidence, Hurst is humble about his work. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists still do not fully agree on why we need to sleep so much. There are three main theories. The most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our body's health. It suggests that while we sleep, our body repairs any damage from the day and restores itself to full strength. Another theory focuses on the learning benefits of sleep. It suggests that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day, and without sleep, we would not be able to learn properly. The third theory is about energy. It says that we need sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who does not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own little habits or interests. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is about showing our uniqueness. Inside us, there is a struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track pushing against each other. One train is called individualism, and the other is conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong more than we want to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs, have meetings, and organize events to share their interests or problems. They look for others who understand them, as their family and friends might see their interests as strange. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting.

We all feel a tension between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We want to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to be more individualistic and show our personality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it without giving up, you will surprise many people."" But this self-conscious individuality is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. However, if they continue these actions until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is being natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. True eccentrics are not concerned with what others think. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of the world around them and react to it. Some want to make an impression on society, and some want to escape from it, but they are all aware of it. Eccentrics, however, continue on their own path without concern for society."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that influenced them the most.

**A Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've been lucky to meet some of the great thinkers in this field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small but powerful woman. She was deeply involved in environmental issues in post-war Europe and created her own strong ideas from her experiences. As a young journalist, she helped me understand these complex topics. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title even in 1976, is her most important work to me. It talks about the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about, like what we now call 'sustainable development.' I've read many books since, but none have matched it.

**B Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their colony. This book explains the amazing world of animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to a well-organized social system. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a famous behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion in this book was brilliant. Ennion's paintings, based on years of watching birds, show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful with just a few lines and colors. This is true art from a field naturalist.

**C Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation but also confirmed my love for nature. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was facing many challenges, but reading this book at the end of the day made everything better. It beautifully combines animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst because of the harm we've done, but I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family. This idea of being connected is something we all need to understand.

I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which led me to start sketching them. But this book offered much more. Besides Ennion's beautiful paintings, it had chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images made me appreciate birds and nature more broadly. It showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was just as valid as a scientific one. Since I was better at art than math or physics, this book opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here’s what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that most people buy books because of reviews, more than ads, word of mouth, or bookshop displays. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are less upset by bad reviews. They think any attention, whether good or bad, can help sell books because readers want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of the book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are still often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make a book and its author known. A good review by a trusted person can boost sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. We rely on them because our books are not by famous authors and we don’t advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest opinions. Reviews can help sell books, but they need to be combined with other things like word-of-mouth, support from bookshops, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
In Britain, the link between publishing and reviews is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can greatly affect a book’s success. In Britain, bookshops don’t always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for a writer to become popular. Some poorly reviewed books or those not reviewed at all sell very well. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn’t sell because people felt they didn’t need to buy it after reading the reviews. The reviewer’s name used to matter more, but now it’s the surprise choice of reviewer or the quality of the review that can persuade people to buy a book."
CAE_2,"The craft of making weathervanes is very old, starting in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith keeps this tradition alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special item just for them,"" he says. ""Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want something special that shows the man's job or hobbies."" 

Traditionally, weathervanes often have a cockerel design, but Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized there are endless ideas for weathervanes,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes as a business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. ""My old job wasn't creative, but this is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval before cutting the design by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are popular too. ""People like handmade things,"" Graham says. ""They like having something a bit different."" Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small, rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities by showing changes in the wind, which affect the weather,"" he explains. ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.""

Graham is getting busier, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. ""The price,"" he explains, ""depends on how detailed the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about what inspired him and his success.

At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. His year started badly when a film project called ""Life and Limb,"" which he had been working on for months, suddenly failed. He was very worried because he hadn't earned any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to keep his bank manager happy. A sensible person in Evans' situation might have looked for a job. He could have returned to working in television or started a TV project he had paused. Instead, he made a risky decision. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

Even though he was acting on a whim, the idea for the story had been with him for a while. It started when he met a farrier (a person who shoes horses) on Dartmoor while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story fascinated Evans. He started researching the topic to write a screenplay, as he was a filmmaker. But after ""Life and Limb"" failed, he decided to write it as a book.

In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he says now. ""I was watching people, but I was mostly alone and felt like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, he was back home and had written half of the book. ""The bank manager was really pressuring us, and I needed to know if it was worth continuing. I showed it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and said it was 'fine.'"" When asked, the agent thought Evans might get $30,000 as an advance for the book. ""I knew how much I needed to pay off some of the debt and keep us going, and it was more than that. I had spent seven months on 'The Horse Whisperer,' and there were at least two more months to go. $30,000 was a tough amount. I was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.""

In October, along with the first two hundred pages of the novel, this summary was sent to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just feel something is happening.'""

What happened next became famous in publishing. Within a week, after intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

As they agreed to this amount, it was decided that the studios should each present their case to Evans. So, one night in October, he sat in his study while four top filmmakers called, one after the other, to ask for the chance to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans told me all this as we drank coffee on a wooden porch above the garden of his home. He said he had since turned down an offer to write the screenplay for ""The Horse Whisperer."" ""It's all been like a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very tough, and I don't want to become an employee of these people who I like and who have paid me so much money. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would be involved, but from a distance. The success of his novel had also brought new offers to support ""Life and Limb,"" but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Title: Young Masters

Bobby Fischer is trying to make a comeback in the world of chess, but age is not on his side. Chess has become a game for younger players. After 20 years away from the game, Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game with a brilliant move, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, he is 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now it is more professional. Winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure is high because players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose the game. Games are longer now, and many are played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30.

The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board. Players must prepare well before matches, especially because computers have changed chess a lot. A small computer can store a million chess games and help players study their opponents. In one recent match, both players had teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now studied very carefully, and being well-prepared can decide the game.

Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for small prize money around the world. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused the whole time. Losing concentration can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the tension, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make moves. This is not a time for deep thinking; it is a battle of nerves and determination.

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess competitions usually last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there are tournaments all year round. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to stop because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10 kg during the match.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his sudden departure from chess in 1972 surprising. It made him a legend. If he returned for money, he will earn a lot. But if he came back to prove he is still the best, the result might be disappointing."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some of the new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

**A. Nick Grosso**

Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three plays that critics love. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's a low-budget film, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" The most surprising thing about Nick is that before writing ""Peaches,"" he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know it's difficult to stage. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very exciting.""

**B. Simon Pegg**

Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed me copying him,"" Simon admits.

**C. Ciaran McMenamin**

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show was well-received, and his career took off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to succeed. Encouraged by his mother, he went from lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for more praise, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""

**D. Neil Taylor**

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released soon. ""The record company talks about a big hit, but I have no idea. For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to get into the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E. Stephen Richards**

Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes and awards than many people twice his age. He is well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings for the past six years. Now his first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express in a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became unhappy with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided I should."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry getting great reviews, moving to novels is brave. ""There's a structure in my poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad writing. My main goal is not to just produce work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this fun and unusual novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to be associated with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance stories and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her bony knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'

B. This story is about the beginning and almost end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart but weak child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. He takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of small stores, old cars, and, of course, the radio.

C. In the author's world, it's normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. So, when successful professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he naturally talks to his wife's ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard because he is a critic. She also wants his help for her brother, who is in prison unfairly. However, the most interesting part is how the author solves these problems. He moves the story along with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships. It makes for a very enjoyable and clever read.

D. Two pairs of best friends—two women and two men—meet in London in the 1960s and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of the four, an American businessman named James Hudson, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years before. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is good. This is a book where you can really get to know the characters and become absorbed in their lives.

E. Written by a top American fiction writer, this funny and caring story is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a mistake and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an unusual bachelor surrounded by the mess of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the touching relationship Ian develops with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a lovely, warm book with the right mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: A Discussion by Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often small. Volunteer tourists might help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot to do this work. If this money were given directly to local communities, it could hire more workers than the volunteer could replace. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often don't have the necessary skills or experience. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is truly about helping others or if it's more about gaining experiences that help in future careers. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and caring in their future lives and careers.

**B.** Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution, and more participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also create international social networks among regular people. In this way, the benefits for both volunteers and host communities can contribute to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by people from wealthier countries, it might only give these volunteers a broader perspective and career advantages, without helping those who don't have access to such opportunities. Volunteers might use these experiences to advance personally, using host communities as a step up.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that benefits the volunteer more than the community, or as a way for wealthy Westerners to advance their careers. At its best, it can benefit both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for an exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism fits with the trend of wanting to help others. These efforts, aimed at making a small difference, can seem positive in a world that is often skeptical of politics. The personal approach is appealing because it avoids big government and business. However, it also skips the democratic process and reduces development to individual acts of charity, often not addressing the root causes of poverty. Criticism of volunteering is not entirely fair, as it can be simple, good-hearted charity. But when volunteer tourism is promoted as sustainable development, it can weaken the true meaning of development. The politics of volunteer tourism can ignore the social reasons behind global inequalities and poverty in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help us get out of bed. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models.

One model has a 'dual alarm function,' but it doesn't work as expected. You can't snooze with the buzzer and then wake up later. The instructions suggest setting two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends, but not everyone needs that. This model is priced similarly to another one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a good deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We liked the radio quality, but it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails. This model was the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock on his test model got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. However, the buttons are so smooth that I kept touching them like piano keys, which was confusing. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don't have to reset it if the plug is pulled out. We all liked this feature, but setting it up was difficult, though we felt 'cool' and sophisticated once we figured it out.

Tom Granger thought the model with a built-in lamp was 'tacky.' You have to pull the light out of its socket to use it, which made him question its quality. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work, and the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light is hard to position and only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer is loud and annoying, like a submarine alarm. Surprisingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people, another model has a bright casing and a bootlace strap. Tom Granger and I liked it because it stands out. It was the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes, either early or late. Paul Bridges thought this was ridiculous and said the model was 'fiddly' and 'useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was 'standard' and took up little space. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found intuitive. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed the buttons correctly. He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was basic, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer worked well, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small animal known for the sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not originally from America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, which makes their spines stick out to protect them. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines because they have evolved to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in sports is challenging for everyone, but women often face extra difficulties. They have to train hard and make sacrifices, leaving little time for a normal life. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming obstacles and setting new records. Here, we talk to some talented British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

""It's amazing to fly through the air and land perfectly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you feel unwell or it's windy, but you just keep going. It's hard to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was surprising since I'd never cycled before! I'm well-paid as a professional, and cycling has many opportunities for sponsorships. However, I worry people might think I succeed because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling rather than making money. I train at least four hours every day on the bike, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is a cyclist too, so he understands the time commitment.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

""Rowing is hard for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most start at 19 or 20, making it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches often stay for only a year, so there's no consistency, and the women's team is disorganized. But it's fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was stubborn and hated being controlled. Now I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours each day with only three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was running out after 95 days. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as risky.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

""Some men have big egos when driving—you see it on highways. When I do well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its downsides. At corners, men think 'I've got to beat her,' so I've had many collisions! You need to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and were seen as unusual. It's great that more women are racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection, always trying to complete a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

""I get up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evening, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous anticipation before a race, and you push yourself hard—you don't feel good if you don't. I've often asked myself why I do it. The answers are: a) I'm happier when I'm fit, b) I'm lazy at heart and would be worse if I didn't do this, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the press, 90% of the article is about the men's event, and only 10% mentions the women's event. The prize money isn't as good either. But we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso, one of the most famous artists of the century. At 18 years old, Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He was low on money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while eating at a restaurant in Cannes harbor, he saw Picasso, who was known to be a private person. Picasso was sitting with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard nervously approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and signed Richard's sketchbook. He even added a playful drawing on the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, using an American woman at the table as an interpreter because Picasso's English was not good.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard started drawing Picasso, who made funny faces to make it difficult for him. Despite the challenge, Richard continued drawing, feeling that Picasso was testing his determination. Eventually, Picasso stopped moving and allowed Richard to study him closely. Richard noticed how youthful and intense Picasso's eyes were, despite his age.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and nodded. Then, Picasso took Richard's crayon and quickly drew a playful face on the paper. Richard was amazed by Picasso's skill and creativity. He asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature.

Looking back, Richard feels very lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. It was a memorable experience for him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers love fresh products. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store look fresh. They might also have a bakery inside, so the smell of fresh bread fills the air. The store might use green colors because people associate green with freshness. Most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't match this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

Where products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas of the store are most popular. They put high-profit items or fast-selling products in these spots. Products at eye level sell better, so manufacturers want their items there. Special offer bins attract people who love bargains. Stores also use 'complementation' by placing related items together, like salad dressings near salads.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets put basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting products. Chain stores do the same with popular items, placing them far from the entrance. They hope loyal customers will look for these items and see other products along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, uses a 'boutique' style, showing fewer items to make them seem exclusive. Even though their clothes are mass-produced, the store design makes them look special.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers care more about the total bill than individual prices. Supermarkets mix low-profit staples with high-profit items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as 'loss leaders.' They also buy in large quantities to get discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice prices more. Pricing something at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This also helps reduce theft, as staff must record the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores use lighting carefully. Chain stores aim for natural light so clothes look the same as they would outside. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh food look better.

**H. Walk This Way**

Chain stores use different flooring to guide shoppers. One type of carpet marks the path, and another marks sales areas. This encourages shoppers to follow the path and explore sales areas. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

When you enter a supermarket, you might see big photos of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that show ads as you shop. These trolleys target impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, aged 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-69, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in a book called ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris contacted Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris the basics of sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while, then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was challenging, but Robin was calm and steady. When they reached a big drop, Chris showed Robin how to climb down safely. Robin, used to climbing down ropes on his boat, managed to lower himself safely.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Although the skipper usually makes all the decisions, Robin asked for everyone's opinion first. Even though most people were too shy to give advice, it was nice to be included in the decision-making.

Chris found the sailing part of the trip boring and difficult. He preferred being on land and wasn't very handy with fixing things. Robin, on the other hand, was a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or the toilet. Chris sometimes felt useless and found it hard to be so close to the crew on a small yacht. When they reached Greenland, Chris led the climbing part of the expedition. He was worried about Robin's safety because if Robin fell, he could pull Chris down with him. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was harder than Chris expected. Robin wasn't a natural climber, but he did very well. On their first attempt, they climbed for 24 hours straight and were so tired they almost fell asleep on steep slopes. Robin trusted Chris completely and followed his lead. Even though Robin was worried about the boat, he was eager to try climbing the mountain again.

The only time Chris and Robin had a disagreement was on the yacht on the way home. They took turns keeping watch, and Chris was supposed to get up at 4 am. Robin decided not to wake him because he thought he could handle it himself. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin quickly reassured him that wasn't the case. By the end of the Greenland expedition, Chris realized that Robin, despite his tough exterior, was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

**Early Apples 8,000 BC**  
People have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, they spat out apple seeds, and 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and wrinkled, known in ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were very different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence 1000 AD**  
The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced the dessert apple, Decio, but most Roman apples didn't suit the British climate. Norman apple varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apples, and many Western apples today come from these varieties.

**Medieval Favorites 1200**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking partner was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the 17th century, giving us the word 'costermonger' for someone who sells fruit and vegetables on the street. However, apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasure 1750**  
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was seen as a medicine man by the Indians and became a folk hero.

**Modern Delicious 1850**  
Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from a dead tree's roots. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

**Granny Smith 1850**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was the daughter of convicts and worked as a midwife in New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith', she managed her family's farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. She said, 'It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity 1950**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, not for taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety of apples. While UK gardeners have preserved many old varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now asking for more variety. We must protect natural diversity in apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

Activities and Interests

Each trip with Explore Worldwide is unique. We have divided our adventures into 8 categories based on activities and interests. Each category highlights a special part of a tour, but many other factors make our trips successful. Unique places, unusual encounters, strange customs, and personal involvement all add to your holiday enjoyment.

Cultural/Adventure

Most of our trips have a strong cultural focus. Some tours emphasize local cultures, ethnic groups, and historical sites. For example, trips to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Belize are rich in culture and history. Short walks of 2-4 hours to less-visited sites are often included.

Wildlife and Natural History

Our wildlife safaris visit some of the world's best game parks, offering exciting animal encounters. In Africa, you can step out of your safari vehicle and explore. You might track gorillas in Zaire, walk with guides in Uganda, climb Mount Kenya, or canoe on the Zambezi River. Most African safaris involve camping, with equipment provided. Some offer hotel stays. In Asia and South America, like our tiger safari in India, we stay in hotels and lodges. In the Galapagos Islands, we live on a small yacht.

Ethnic Encounters

A highlight of our trips is meeting ethnic or tribal peoples. You might meet the Tuareg in the Sahara, the Maya in Mexico, or the Huli in Papua New Guinea. Some groups, like the Bushmen, are nomadic, while others, like the pygmies, are hunter-gatherers. We travel in small groups to promote understanding and minimize cultural impact.

Easy/Moderate Hiking

Many trips include easy walks through the countryside, staying in rented or hotel accommodation. Village-to-village hikes may involve staying overnight in private homes or village huts. These trips are available in places like Spain, Provence, Tuscany, Crete, Corsica, Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, and Venezuela. On longer walks, your main luggage is transported separately.

Major Treks

We offer a few major treks for strong walkers. These may involve high altitudes and significant elevation changes. We might stay with locals or camp in mountain ranges like the Atlas, Himalayas, and Andes. In more developed areas like the Alps, we use campsites and chalets. Support vehicles or porters carry heavy gear.

Wilderness Experience

Exploring remote wilderness areas is a thrilling adventure. We visit places like the Amazon Rainforest and the Sahara Desert. These trips offer a chance to experience exotic landscapes and cultures.

Sailtreks/Seatreks

These relaxing holidays involve traveling by boat. We use traditional sailboats in Egypt, motor yachts in Turkey, and ferries in Greece and Thailand. Our schooner explores Indonesian islands, and a motor yacht visits the Galapagos.

Raft and River Journeys

River trips can last from a few hours to several days. They range from small inflatables to whitewater rafting with skilled guides. No experience is needed, and safety skills are taught quickly. Our river trips in India, Africa, and the Amazon offer unique views of the landscape."
CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British long-distance runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located near Mount Kenya, which is the highest peak in the country. For three years, Richard trained in Kenya's Central Highlands during the winter, but he had never trained with Kenyan runners in their own country until his fourth visit. During this trip, he competed in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This camp is where Kenya's best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. Richard was invited to the camp by Kenya's national team coach after he finished fifth in a World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. 

Training at high altitudes helps runners because it increases the number of red blood cells, which improves how the body uses oxygen. This is one reason why Kenyan runners have been so successful. Richard's first race in Africa was an international cross-country race in Nairobi, the first of its kind on the continent. Although 41 runners finished ahead of him, most of them were Kenyan, and he felt he had performed well. 

However, Richard believes that Kenyan success is not just due to high altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to running. They run with ease, eat simple foods, and enjoy competing. The way they train is also important. At the training camp, Richard learned about their training methods. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The camp is basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with college students, six to a room, in simple dormitories. 

Each day, the athletes have three workouts: an easy run in the morning, interval training in the mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they only run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner include ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers. 

By the end of his stay, Richard appreciated Kenyan success even more. He realized that their success is not just about genetics, upbringing, or altitude. It might also be due to the simple lifestyle, hard training, and passion for success. These could be the real reasons behind Kenya's achievements in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard. The problem is deeper and affects the whole world. Advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers think about mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options appear, target markets have become smaller. Big brand campaigns should focus on smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Consider your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but many won't be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 products available. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For big items like cars, you might buy one every three years, and it might be provided by your employer. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with all the products and services you buy, you likely don't purchase more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare this to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys 400 of these, not all because of advertising. That's about 4%. So, the saying that half of advertising is wasted is wrong. It's more like 96% is wasted, but no one knows which part. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 (6%), so the rest (94%) seem wasted.

You might think you're not influenced by advertising, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. It's unrealistic to think everyone will buy all the brands they see. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste can't be avoided. But advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the few who will respond, even if it's expensive. 

With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who might respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns don't get a 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media. This applies to all types of ads, from personal notices to soft drink commercials.

An advertiser who gains one million new customers (2% of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2% of the population is very successful, but that's still a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Title: Britain's Most Environmentally-Friendly Home

Charles Clover explores Britain's most eco-friendly house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Southwell is known for its ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, which features medieval carvings of 'green' men. The town is also home to the 'autonomous house', designed by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is the greenest house in Britain.

The Vales' house uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into garden compost, and is heated by waste heat from electrical appliances and the body heat of the family and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with its clay tile roof and fits in with the town's historic buildings, even though it is in a conservation area.

The house is super-insulated with special windows that keep it very quiet inside. When you enter, you must take off your shoes, and the house feels very peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. The Vales open special ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very well sealed.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been interested in the environment for a long time. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed their house to produce no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They use composting toilets, collect rainwater, and filter it for drinking. They also avoid using strong detergents.

Robert Vale says they wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is less harmful to the environment without living in darkness. The house's design is modern, but the hall is tall and open like in medieval times. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, they used only a small amount of electricity, costing about 70p a day. They plan to install solar panels to generate even more electricity, enough to charge an electric car.

The only heating in the house is a small wood-burning stove, which they rarely use. In winter, the house stays warm because there are no draughts and everything inside is at the same temperature. Robert Vale explains that people used to be comfortable at lower temperatures because of their clothing.

The house is simple and low-tech, with materials from local builders, making it affordable to build. However, commercial building companies are not interested in this idea."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a logical and scientific person. However, in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were real evidence that fairies existed. He published these photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simple trick challenges the idea that the camera always tells the truth. In fact, it can lie, and it always could. Today, we are familiar with using computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, when cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Blacksmiths

Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and those who work with it, blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs.

In the past 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in blacksmithing, thanks to a renewed interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Still, much of the work seems old-fashioned, with many gates and balconies advertised as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy design stores often sell rusty candlesticks with decorations. Fortunately, there are new options, and several events in the coming weeks aim to promote the blacksmith's craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, 'We could be at the start of a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now.' Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it with ease. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.' About 250 pieces have been made for the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a percentage will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork, says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. 'My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,' he says.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes rigid and immovable again.' Ann Catrin Evans' steel door-knockers and handles seem inspired by the castles seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And it feels like it will last forever.' No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. Iron will likely continue to be used decoratively for many years, as long as we don't have to see more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"Title: THE DAY I QUIT SMOKING

I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was really angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It even surprised me. 

The session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to quit, and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups, and I still am. I had low blood pressure and a healthy family, so I didn't feel sick or cough. I even got over colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking in Birmingham to write an article about others trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't be trying to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, so I didn't expect their method to work on me. I actually enjoyed smoking; it made me happy. The counselor seemed to understand something I didn't.

We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. The messages about quitting made sense to me. Just like smoking had been a challenge because people were against it, quitting started to seem appealing. The idea of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and only lasted for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I needed nicotine to meet deadlines and write stories, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, the hardest part was spending weekend mornings at home without smoking, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; it was an activity by itself.

Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is different, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's biography, finds it surprising that many people in Britain are unaware of Hodgkin's achievements. If a British woman had won a Nobel Prize in literature, she would likely be a household name. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the global spread of science.

When Ferry started her research, she read scientific biographies and was recommended a biography of Linus Pauling, a friend and contemporary of Hodgkin. Pauling was a famous chemist and Nobel Prize winner, yet his biography was not available in a local bookshop. This reflects a common belief that scientific biographies are not interesting, a view shared by some scientists themselves. For example, Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that scientists' lives are often dull to read about. This belief contributes to the idea that there is a big gap between the arts and sciences, which affects how scientists are portrayed in biographies.

However, this is changing. Scientists are now more visible in the media, doing things like presenting TV shows or appearing in advertisements. This helps people see scientists as real people. The publishing world is also changing, with more engaging scientific biographies being written. Books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" show scientists as interesting people with personal lives.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. She solved the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which were major achievements. She won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964. Despite her busy career, she also had a family, with three children and a husband who was often away. Her ability to balance her work and personal life is inspiring.

Understanding scientific ideas can be challenging, but it is not harder than learning a new language or reading complex literature. It is unfortunate that many educated people do not recognize the names of important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they have made significant contributions to our world."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Special Skill

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability often called a 'sixth sense'. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells using machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

This skill, known as dowsing, is the ability to find water, minerals, or lost objects underground. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical reasons like magnetism to spiritual ones. One believable idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers might be very good at feeling these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others say they can smell it, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent dry years, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers whose wells have dried up. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other customers have remote cottages or barns turned into holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. Some are golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where farm waste might get into the water. The water we find is in cracks of hard rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, you have to watch out for iron in the water.' Another important thing is electricity to power the pump. It's too costly to run electricity over long distances, so the well should be near power supplies.

After considering all this, Margaret starts looking for water. On large areas like golf courses, she uses a map and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when there is water below.' After finding likely areas on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick. 'When I'm above water, I feel strange and slightly dizzy. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the stick with both hands and pulls it slightly to create tension. 'When water is right below, the stick rises. It's important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If you drill even a little off, you might miss the water. My husband checks the same area, and we usually agree on where to drill. If we don't agree, we keep looking until we do.'

Margaret is not alone in using this old method in the west of England. Many people are interested in this mysterious skill. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', which is the best way to explain how she finds water so well. Without this 'sixth sense', how could her family continue their well-drilling business successfully year after year?"
CAE_36,"**We changed lives for a day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different? We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. She had to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand in just fifteen minutes. It seemed easy for the other waitresses, but Amanda struggled and dropped the drinks. The other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line of customers had formed outside, and Amanda felt nervous. Luckily, the orders were automated, so she didn't have to remember them. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she found the loud music hard to handle. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised when a waitress said it had been a 'quiet' day. Amanda realized waitressing was tiring and required a bubbly personality and a cool head. She didn't like the pay and didn't get any tips. She was happy to return to her children, finding it easier than waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a 'mum' for the day. She thought she could handle Amanda's cheeky daughters, but it was harder than she expected. After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls, drop Sophie at school, and Katie at nursery. She thought she would have some free time, but Amanda left a note with chores like making beds, cleaning, and doing laundry. After picking up Katie and shopping, she brought Sophie home, and the girls started jumping on the sofa and screaming. Cindy hoped they would tire out, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to look after two small children and realized how much responsibility it involved. Despite the challenges, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher. Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was unsure about what to wear to school. At assembly, she hoped to blend in with the 400 pupils. In a maths class, she helped children work in groups, which was different from her school days. She also assisted with a nature project on snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but found teachers only had a short break. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced on her rusty French. Finally, they had Physical Education, and Rosemary was exhausted. She found speaking in front of the class challenging. Although teachers have more holidays, she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream. Hilary spent the morning in the ice cream parlour, bottling milk and packaging ice cream. She was tempted to taste the treats. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. Sheep need daily checks, especially in winter. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The hardest part was not being able to take time off, as cows need milking daily. Farming seemed romantic, but the reality was different, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who didn't play music, grew up in a rural area of southern Sweden. By the age of 30, he became a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he looks young and is friendly, much like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature focused on his work and growth, filmed in both the UK and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo, and his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and Hardenberger played it constantly. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson. Nilsson, a rising musician, quickly noticed Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher who loved the trumpet and connected with players worldwide.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument with imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are the same. He believes in understanding these imperfections and working with them. From a young age, he had a special sound, which he developed early on. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. Hardenberger's parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.

At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but during his first competition at 17 in Paris, he realized he had a special ability to connect with audiences. Thibaud suggested entering the competition for experience. Hardenberger learned the first round pieces and advanced to the second round, where he knew most of the music. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and noticed that people listened to him, even if he thought he didn't play perfectly.

Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not true. He doesn't try to analyze his ability to connect with audiences, saying that trying to explain it might ruin it. He believes the power of music is in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**A.** The story of Tristan Smith takes place in the made-up country of Efica. It is a special story about human power, history, and humor. The author has created a unique world with its own history and traditions. The book is known for its humor and the author's special way of seeing things. It combines this with deep psychological understanding, making it a challenging but rewarding read.

**B.** Harriet is a middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not meet someone like Sheila, who is from a working-class background and takes care of her elderly father and grandson, Leo. Their lives change when Leo attacks Harriet's son, Joe, on the street. After the court case, neither boy talks about the incident. Leo, who was a good student and never fought before, won't say why he did it. Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, and they form an unusual friendship. The author is good at showing how people deal with big changes in their lives and captures the feeling that mothers have when they feel they can never do enough.

**C.** This book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The story is set against important moments in Scottish history, imagined by the young main character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He disappears at one point in the book but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

**D.** After a recent successful book, the author has written a sequel with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life is a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness. Rosie helps her in her enjoyable manipulation of suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora realizes that time has passed and a new generation is taking over. The author is good at showing the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary parts of life and focuses more on the shadows than the bright moments of human activity.

**E.** Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses impressive descriptive language to show the personal journeys of self-discovery that each person experiences. They return home with their spirits renewed by their time on the ""desert cities of waves."" The author uses surprising images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both confusing and enlightening."
CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical workday looks like.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work by 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I operate all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most head surgeries take three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or using the bathroom. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I do worry about the next day's plans. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it's amazing and makes up for the times it doesn't. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain the operations. I enjoy talking to patients and find it easy. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about my patients, and I dream about operating at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work, any problems, or if anyone needs help. We work in teams. My team has three senior designers, a company partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. The work is about 10-15% design; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client, and if we're lucky, they have clear ideas about their goals, target market, and project form. I spend three to four weeks designing, researching, and developing the project. After presenting my ideas to the client and getting their approval, we work out estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers and ensure the job's needs are met on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well with a wide range of people. Briefing them correctly is essential. When their work comes in, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Managing several jobs at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always close, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and we try to go to the pub. Otherwise, I have sandwiches and work through. It's a great feeling when the client likes your designs and the project works; it's disappointing when you've worked hard, and the job gets rejected. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often at 8:30 pm, and sometimes much later. I find it hard to relax when I get back, especially if I'm very busy.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up at 7 am, but two or three times a week, I meet a long-haul flight from Heathrow or Gatwick and wake up between 4:30 am and 5 am. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Because driving is a sitting job, I have to watch my diet and exercise carefully. I usually have a big breakfast and just snack during the day. People often ask me to recommend restaurants, nightclubs, or shops, so I need to know my way around. Luckily, many jobs are pre-booked, so I can check routes beforehand. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are unfriendly, some arrogant, and some very rude. But most people are well-behaved, and I've built good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving and not listen. The press has tried to make me talk about clients, but I won't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed and landscaped. We do a few commercial jobs, but most work is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local cafe for a big breakfast. I often wish time didn't pass so quickly. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so when I return, I listen to messages and respond to calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I usually arrange a consultation in the evening, around 7 pm or 8 pm. We specialize in using old materials, like old bricks and unusual plants, to make gardens look old. But sometimes people have specific ideas, and they can be quite bad. Still, it's very satisfying to complete a landscape and see all the flowers bloom. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business phone ring. I never have trouble sleeping because the work is so physical that I'm always exhausted at the end of the day. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. Physically, it's a tough job, but it lets your imagination run wild.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. I'm the assistant resident engineer, so I oversee building a couple of bridges and a retaining wall, which stops people from driving off the road into a quarry. I check that the contractors follow the schedule and specifications, with correct safety systems and minimal environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6 am, so my first task is to find out from the clerk of works what's happened since I left the night before. The rest of the day depends on what he tells me. Usually, there's paperwork from the contractors to review, or there might be design questions to answer. Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I tend to eat as I go. The contractors have set mealtimes, and when they're eating, it's easier to check things on site. Because we're checking their work, it can cause conflict, so our relationship has to be open. I see the duty resident engineer once a day. However, if something important comes up, I don't wait to tell them before I act. I usually leave the site at about 6 pm and am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage customer programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards program in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, and concert information. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important to the artists. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly work-related, and I often get home at 1:00 am, where I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques priced from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts once a month and the tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm and it takes me about an hour to relax.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work set shifts, and on early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before switching stations. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we control aircraft movements together. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4:00 am. It's important to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if I'm not feeling well. The work is stressful, and it takes time to unwind after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect me to gather many books based on reviews. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' representatives visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Twice a week, I work a late shift, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8:45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in the region I cover. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly. I type stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any changes before they go online. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm. It's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and brings about change. Leadership isn't about being tall or having a certain background, as people once thought. It's not just about being smart, either. Pat Dixon, who wrote ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen with people who are as excited and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""

B. **Recognizing Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes many people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing these hidden talents. We all have the ability to lead; we just need the right situation to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it can be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

C. **Comparing Leaders and Managers**  
Think about the best and worst boss you've had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and kept information from you, blaming you when things went wrong. The first was a true leader; the second just managed poorly.

D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" says, ""A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization.""

E. **Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you are passionate about and act on it.  
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.  
- Sometimes collaboration is good, but firm leadership is needed at times. Try different styles. If you usually ask for others' opinions, try taking the lead and see how it changes the outcome.  
- Set goals and exceed them. Identify areas in your job where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career.

F. **Developing Leadership**  
- Leadership develops by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.  
- Your leadership style might not win everyone over immediately. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.  
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is important and help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine stuck deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting to compare with Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton’s is a more traditional war movie, and it often stays closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his tough relationship with his sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's version has its highlights. The flashback scene, where the soldier dreams of his wife, is done with a harshness that might work better than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer adventures. It features a great villain in Fabrice Luchini's sneaky politician, who causes chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez plays an energetic hero, though his role is short-lived. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for this fun film, also has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with so much wit and energy that it doesn’t matter.

**D. Character**  
This is a serious story set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costume design make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless when evicting tenants. The difficult relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on period details to fully explore this dark and intense tale.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video shows director Leone's skills at their best. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear and loud. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement. Morally, there isn’t much difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act without much scruple in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic, promoted with 'forty-eight international stars,' is directed by four directors and includes 23,000 extras. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, feel as long for the audience as for the soldiers. Logistically, it’s impressive, but it’s better suited for the big screen. On video, it loses some of its impact."

""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a gripping story. The narrator is a lawyer trying to start a new career after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement and follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets involved in politics, church intrigue, and murder. We always believe he will solve the mystery. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. The main character, Leah Hunter, is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective, Leah is strong and successful. This is a refreshing and exciting story.

**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more thinking than violence. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate a burglary and attack at a famous film star's daughter's house. The author's easy writing style and understanding of human behavior make this mystery entertaining.

**BOOK F**  
""Blood Red, Snow White"" is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features a lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book mixes romance, money, and violence to create an exciting suspense novel.

**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters come together to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels his career is not going well. While Shaw usually entertains, this book is not as good as his others.

**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" by Lawrence Gough is his best book in a while. Canadian police are after a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"At 34, Tim Pozzi decided to leave his good job and go backpacking. He wonders why he and others his age are making this big decision. This summer, he quit his job, rented out his flat, and planned to travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think he's lucky, but he's nervous. It's not his first time traveling; after university, he spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When he returned, he wanted to do it again someday. But life happened—he fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, he realized he was giving up his happiness for money. When he resigned, he felt like he was in control of his life again. Now, he has no ties. Many of his friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with him, they envy his freedom. He's not in a relationship and has no strong career goals, so he feels he should make the most of his freedom, even for his friends' sake.

Why is he nervous? First, he has to make arrangements. How can he let someone else live in his home? How will he organize the rental? And he needs to decide where to go. He's a procrastinator and is already weeks behind his plan. He told himself to enjoy the summer in England and then thought about staying for the start of the football season. Cutting emotional ties makes it harder. He's delaying because he wonders if he can still handle backpacking. Can he adjust to a simpler life? Will he fit in with younger backpackers? Maybe he will. More Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives behind and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people are realizing they can have adventures if they're brave, organized, and confident.

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny is willing to give up job security for the trip. He knows he might not move up the career ladder, but he thinks it's a risk worth taking. When he left his office, he threw his calculator into the river as a sign of defiance. For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a time of change. In the military, there's a set way of doing things. He needed to change this to live well as a civilian.

There are many reasons to travel at this age, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says the workforce is more flexible now. More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose. Some big companies even have career-break policies. They prefer employees to return rather than work for competitors. Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more people in their thirties are rethinking their lives. If you're not happy with your job, it's not about just sticking with it. People know opportunities exist, and jobs aren't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess and think about life.

Is this wanderlust just a sign of not wanting to grow up? Jennifer Cox doesn't think so. She says it's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society. People want a balanced life, not just to pay bills. They ask, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. He's running towards something he wants. But he does feel nervous about leaving behind his comfortable routine, like going to the office every day and having coffee with colleagues.

Tim shares Ben's worries about leaving a stable life. He's not sure he would travel if his boss wasn't so difficult. Jennifer Cox says there's often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel. It took a push for Tim to start, but now he's excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, he'll be happy he took the chance. He believes many older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from her journalism career and felt disconnected from the new technology. She shares how she turned her home into an efficient workplace. The Christmas before last, when I turned 37, I realized I needed to restart my journalism career, which seemed outdated. My resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, using old technology like typewriters. It seemed impossible for me to work with computers in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for desktop publishing experience, which I didn't have. I felt more likely to teach nuclear physics than to design a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators confused me, and I couldn't use the video timer. Clearly, I needed to act fast to save my career. I thought leaving home before the kids would be hard until I entered a local newspaper competition. Like a story you hear about but never expect to happen to you, my family won a computer package. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We quickly learned about cyberspace, the Internet, and surfing. We started chatting with people worldwide online. The kids stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take the kids to school. The kids were comfortable with computers from school, but I was hesitant, afraid of losing my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. I learned the basic skills I needed, and it was all logical and easy. With practice, I learned more each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds. How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always messy, and I lost important notes. The computer made me organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help track income and expenses, and pre-made invoices and letterheads save time. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide. But there is a downside to working from home. You can feel isolated from people. There are distractions like house chores, and when the kids are home, we argue over who uses the computer. However, more people are buying multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and entertainment. In my street, a new type of home business is growing because people don't have to commute to the city. So, what defines home workers as we move into the next century? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, and 32% have a CD-ROM; 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I seem to be ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or should I say cyberspace, is the limit."
CAE_59,"The Tartan Museum

The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh has modern buildings that look very different from the historic area around them. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see if the inside was as interesting as the outside. The museum is easy to spot with its large, yellow sandstone tower and unique building shape. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building's design, with some praising it as a masterpiece and others not liking it at all. Now, as the museum is about to open, the exhibitions inside are expected to get similar reactions.

The museum tells the story of Scotland with many interesting objects, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver. It has a timeline to help visitors understand the history, but it doesn't focus too much on national pride. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to visit more than once. Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no imaginary scenes or mock-ups. Instead, the museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some multimedia to tell the stories of the objects.

Inside the museum, the spaces are impressive. The galleries are different sizes and shapes, with pale walls that look like stone and deep display cases. Natural light comes in through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy the exhibits. The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of 9- to 12-year-olds from all over Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a hands-on center for kids.

On the top floor, there is a Twentieth Century gallery, which will change every three years. It features objects chosen by Scottish people and others that have impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Some items include an electric guitar, televisions, and favorite toys. While the idea is fun, it might seem less serious until the computer system with personal stories is ready next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can show the past better than anything else. The modern architecture of the museum works well from the inside, but whether it fits the historic location is still a question."
CAE_54,"The end of print newspapers might take a while. The word ""transition"" suggests a smooth change from the present to the future. However, the shift from print newspapers to online versions is not smooth or certain. Many people think it will happen because print sales are dropping while website visits are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8% to 10% in a year, but their websites are more popular. 

However, the situation is not so simple. The World Association of Newspapers reported a 1.1% increase in global newspaper circulation last year, with Asia's growth balancing out declines in the West. News magazines also saw a 5.4% increase. Books show a similar trend: e-reader sales are rising, but physical book sales only dropped by 0.4%. 

Young people are still reading newspapers. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read national dailies in the UK. Different countries have different trends. In the UK, print sales fell by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop was only 7%, and in France, just 3.1%. 

In the US, online advertising was expected to support online newspapers, but digital ad revenues are now falling. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to get paying readers is to offer both print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions and earns much more from advertising than online versions. 

Maintaining both print and online editions is challenging and costly for newspapers. However, print still gives newspapers a strong presence, which is harder to achieve online."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well can be challenging. Besides technical and artistic skills, photographers need to pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.

**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or take the photo from a higher angle.

**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff and awkward. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you are not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first, and might feel flattered. However, they may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A picture can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away from the camera.

**D. EYE CONTACT**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask your subject to look into the lens, but they don't have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny or unexpected to get a natural reaction.

**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something in the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are interesting, and the subject's expression is important.

**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about the subject. A laughing child makes the viewer smile, while a sad expression can make the viewer feel sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. SITUATION INTEREST**

Photos that show a person with their background can add interest and information. When using a background, exclude irrelevant details or blur them. Make sure the subject stands out and isn't overwhelmed by the background. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. INTERACTION**

When two or more people are interacting, there are opportunities for great photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams working or playing sports make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake, or wait for an expressive gesture.

**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**

Many photos of people are taken on holiday to show the places they visit. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask your subjects to stand close to the camera, forming a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help balance the subjects and the place.

**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all formal poses. Candid pictures of events are more lively, and you can capture natural shots when you know the subject well. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, Sarah talks about her work and her approach to art.

Sarah Janson is one of the few artists who doesn't sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes the artwork is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and sometimes acts like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a bit shy during interviews. She doesn't like to talk about herself and feels uncomfortable being photographed.

However, once she feels more relaxed, the interview becomes interesting and fun. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she wasn't satisfied with illustration, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil piece, and she found her passion.

Sarah's skills in observation and attention to detail, which she developed through illustration, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil work. She believes that no one can teach you trompe-l'oeil; it's about observing life. She is always learning and believes that if you think you've mastered something, it's time to stop.

Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, like her difficulty in painting bread, which she says looks like grey concrete. She also struggles with math, which was a challenge when she worked on a large project for a chapel ceiling. She often questions herself and talks about her work as if someone else did it.

Despite her modesty, Sarah's work is exceptional. Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are much better than those of many others who have tried this art form. She has completed many important projects for both companies and private clients. Her work is often inspired by architecture, like a dining room painted to look like a Venetian palace or a corridor painting that makes it seem like there are more rooms.

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must first trick the viewer and then keep their interest. It should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients and believes that good ideas come from their interaction. Some clients know exactly what they want, while others need more guidance. Sarah listens carefully to understand their vision.

Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working on their projects. She appreciates her clients, especially those who trust her with their walls. Even though she doesn't like to boast about her talent, her clients are very happy with her work, which keeps her busy.

Sarah repeats that she doesn't like to talk about herself or her work too much. She believes that things that shout for attention can become boring. However, her work is anything but boring and deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman talks about the 'people skills' needed to succeed in your career.

**A** The way we are judged at work is changing. It's not just about how smart we are or our training, but also how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is important for deciding who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who might become a top performer and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs, no matter what field you work in. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams doesn't matter much here. This new measure assumes we all have enough intelligence and technical skills. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence.

**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, and the idea of a 'job' is changing to 'portable skills'. Personal qualities are becoming important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills' before, but now we call them 'emotional intelligence'. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your own and others' feelings, and use them to guide your actions. At work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice', but sometimes it means being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. It doesn't mean expressing all your feelings freely. It means managing them so they help people work well together towards a common goal.

**C** More businesses see that emotional intelligence is important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. Without it, technical skills and intelligence might not be enough. Some people succeed without strong emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and team-based, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today's workplace, with a focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is essential for success everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people get better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others as they age. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can add these skills to help us succeed, especially when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence isn't a magic solution for struggling companies, ignoring it can make everything else less effective."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often first appears on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images when events happen quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Even though there is official advice that images on social media can be used without permission in special situations or if there is a strong public interest, people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, so UGC is clearly important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture's Origins and Use**  
Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health issues, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**Understanding Acupuncture**  
In traditional Chinese medicine, health is seen as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can cause illness. An acupuncturist will try to find where the Qi is out of balance by checking your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health and lifestyle. They use fine needles inserted into the skin to help restore the flow of Qi. Sometimes, they also use heat or pressure on certain points.

**Acupuncture Points**  
The points used in acupuncture are related to the meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. There are over 300 main points on the meridians, with many more used less often.

**Scientific Explanations**  
Even without accepting traditional Chinese medicine, Western doctors recognize that acupuncture can help with pain. They have scientific explanations for how it might work. For example, acupuncture might block pain signals from reaching the brain or release natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments don't work. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This convinced some Western doctors of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to reduce pain without the side effects of traditional anesthesia, like nausea, and allows for quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
Clinical trials for acupuncture are hard to conduct, but some show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with these results but acknowledge it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, though some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.

**Different Views on Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They spend time diagnosing and finding weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider external factors like weather and the type of pain. This approach is different from that of most Western doctors.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**  
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others use scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional methods can deep, long-lasting changes be made. When choosing an acupuncturist, ensure they are qualified and will refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer. She seems calm and confident, like she could have been the headmistress of a girls' school if she hadn't become a writer. However, she admits that her confidence hides her shyness. Her famous detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is based on how she imagines she would be if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, and needs privacy to do her best work.

P.D. James is known worldwide for her 12 detective novels, but she is humble and doesn't see herself as Britain's most famous crime writer. She enjoys reading books by her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine, and other female authors like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively. She also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, a student at the university. Her life has had its challenges. Her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped by taking care of the children during those tough times.

While working full-time for the National Health Service, she managed several psychiatric clinics. Later, she worked for the Home Office in the Police Department and the Criminal Law section, dealing with juvenile crime. During her time in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but it was the structure of writing crime novels that interested her, not death itself. She always wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to learn how to write serious novels. She believes that writing detective stories is about bringing order to chaos and that solving a crime shows the value of life, even if the person who died was not well-liked. She also thinks that nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

**The Study of Handwriting to Reveal a Person's Character is Gaining Support**

In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting could help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help show certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and reveal psychological and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many big companies hire graphologists to study the handwriting of people applying for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are still unsure about the value of graphology.

Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, believes doctors should take it more seriously. She thinks handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental ability and potential, whether someone should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a devious or open character.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in identifying possible criminal tendencies. She says, ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have stopped developing emotionally. This often appears in childish handwriting and in going over letters several times. I can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees.""

She also mentions that young male offenders often have very high ascenders in their writing, showing they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can tell if violence might happen, if the writer is under a lot of pressure, or if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can even predict potential suicides. Heart and lung problems can also appear in handwriting. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A big emotional upset can also show in a temporarily changed signature.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. People whose letters form ""threads"" instead of being separate are often devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves. Light pressure shows sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting, or how much it differs from standard script, shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures show inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a call for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this must be combined with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She thinks this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a person's whole history, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer incorrectly.""

While this sounds interesting, there is little solid evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is a result of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught, and it has no other meaning."
CAE_41,"Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy, healthy team, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions:

Office A: Advertising Agency  
- **Building Health Consultant**: This office is very simple, with no central heating or mechanical ventilation. Windows open directly to the street. The team of seven people seems happy and adapts to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, like at home. They have created a homely environment without much outside control.  
- **Ergonomist**: The furniture is mismatched and often leads to bad posture. Chairs are old, not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the varied work schedule, including office work, client meetings, and presentations, helps reduce fatigue and boredom.  
- **Occupational Psychologist**: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They find the office the right size—small enough to know what others are doing, but big enough for personal work. The office is attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service  
- **Building Health Consultant**: The office is comfortable and not disliked by staff. Air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
- **Ergonomist**: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal with grey, bare walls.  
- **Occupational Psychologist**: Walls are bare except for planners and a maternity rights poster. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are okay. The office could improve by rearranging desks for better information sharing and displaying success stories or project information.

Office C: Bank  
- **Building Health Consultant**: The office feels like a glass case, with mixed reactions from staff. Despite smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air is not stale.  
- **Ergonomist**: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements, but this is by user choice. Computer screens are on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is outdated.  
- **Occupational Psychologist**: Staff support each other and have good technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood paneling and brown carpet give a slightly serious look. The office is busy.

Office D: Newspaper  
- **Building Health Consultant**: The building has many issues. The air-conditioning is poor, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and desks are too small. The office is dusty, and the roof collects dust that falls on people.  
- **Ergonomist**: The furniture is more suited for a workshop than a high-tech office. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially shorter people. Many chairs are old, lack adjustments, and have armrests that keep users too far from the desk.  
- **Occupational Psychologist**: The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning, especially with many smokers. Few conversations were happening; everyone seemed stressed by deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and used by people from all walks of life. In the United States, people chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. Let's explore how this ancient habit turned into a big business.

Each stick of chewing gum has less than ten calories. However, it is considered a food, so it must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. Modern gum is mostly made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. But this wasn't always the case.

The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in the Central American rainforest. Chicle gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to the growth of the gum industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances in humid conditions to collect sapodilla sap. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Using just a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero can climb a tree quickly to collect the sap. They carry the sap to a camp, where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with a simple diet of maize and local alcohol.

Despite the difficult conditions, chicleros worry about their jobs. The United States used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to cut costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are also finding new ways to market their products. They claim gum helps you relax, boosts energy, and reduces tension. During both world wars, soldiers were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms and causes decay. Saliva neutralizes the acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used in gum. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. In the U.S., 137 square kilometers of land is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian cultural elements. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests. The facilities are simple, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel is on New Zealand's South Island. I discovered it by accident while climbing. After a long climb down from a glacier, I was surprised to find this hotel in a beautiful, wild, and high-up area. It was amazing to arrive tired and find such luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**  
Located on the southwest of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel passes empty beaches with only fishermen. The hotel is not small, and many people enjoy the free watersports, but you can find solitude on nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone leaves, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL, ST LUCIA**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia is in a dramatic Caribbean setting. It is quiet and remote, standing 1,000 feet high, with open rooms offering views of the Pitons and the Caribbean Sea. The style is colonial, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture, and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**

CAE_47,"**The Hotel Inspector**

Sue Brown works as a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her do her job. Just one minute into her yearly check, things start to go wrong at the Globe Hotel. The receptionist is busy telling room prices over the phone and doesn't notice Sue, the real guest, waiting. Sue whispers, ""Very poor,"" because the receptionist hasn't even acknowledged them. This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from the Globe Hotel because it has three red stars, which means it's one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide her organization publishes.

Even before the cold welcome, Sue is not impressed. The way from the car park to the hotel is through an empty door with a buzzer and a long, empty corridor. ""Not what I expected,"" says Sue. Things get worse when the receptionist says they have no record of Sue's booking. There are 15 rooms in the hotel, and 12 are empty that night. One room on the top floor is not to Sue's liking. It's stuffy, and there's a big hole in the wall behind a wardrobe panel.

Sue was known for being tough when she started her career. ""The Woman in Black,"" she recalls, even though she never wore black. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel's general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks terrified. Before she says more, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge, saying there's probably a blocked drain. Sue suggests they should not take guests to that room and use another lounge instead. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He's been at the Globe for only five months and finds it hard to believe Sue when she says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who shared interesting facts about the hotel's 400-year history. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks what they need to do to get three rosettes. Sue suggests, ""Not serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves' brief hope fades.

Sue's job is to say the complaints that other guests are too afraid to mention. ""Sometimes it's a delicate situation,"" she says. Once, a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served her apple pie with his fingers. Sue often receives letters with false accusations, but it still hurts. She has to tell the hotelier her findings and also send a full written report. Hotels pay to be in the guide, so they want honest feedback. Being in the red-star category is worth it. Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue won't recommend removing the Globe's red stars. However, another inspector will return in two months to check if everything is fixed. ""Good,"" says Greaves, not very convincingly. ""We'll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,"**Seven Up: Climbing the Seven Summits**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. Here is a summary of his journey:

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
My journey to climb the Seven Summits started later in life. I climbed Mt. Everest with my partner, Dougal Haston. We stayed in a snow cave near the top, and due to lack of oxygen, we experienced strange conversations. Despite the cold affecting my feet, I felt confident with Dougal by my side. We reached the summit by maintaining a steady rhythm.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
Known as one of the most dangerous mountains, Dougal and I climbed it in April 1976. We carried all our equipment and food on our backs, a style called 'alpine style.' The climb was tough due to low air pressure, making it feel higher than it was. After a challenging ascent, we finally reached the summit.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, I climbed Kilimanjaro with Paul Braithwaite. We got lost in the jungle, which was dangerous due to the lack of water. We found our way by following arrows and rubbish. We attempted a difficult route but switched to an easier one to reach the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, my wife Sharu and I climbed Aconcagua. We joined a group taking a less crowded route. Due to time constraints, we avoided the Polish Glacier and took the standard path to the summit. Meeting other climbers inspired me to consider climbing all Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
In November 1992, I realized climbing all Seven Summits was possible. We traveled to Antarctica, where the sun never sets at that time of year. Despite harsh weather, we reached the summit in eight hours, though visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In the summer of 1994, our team climbed Elbrus. After acclimatizing, we took a cableway partway up and then hiked to a refuge. We thought we reached the summit but discovered another ridge to climb. We returned to the refuge as night fell.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
On this expedition, we aimed to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, we climbed the mountain, which is near a large gold mine. We reached the summit by 11 am, completing my goal of climbing all Seven Summits. Mission accomplished!"
FCE_15,"**Style Merchants**

Style is important in our lives today, from clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**

Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He suggests choosing simpler styles instead of traditional, stiff, or frilly dresses. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. Besides wedding dresses, he also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer something traditional, he offers a classic navy-blue summer suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes for most of the 20th century, but with a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer and has no formal training in jewelry. She started designing jewelry when she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous people seek her pieces. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century jewelry. Recently, she started using diamonds. At 36, she says, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**

Lily Grimson entered the competitive fashion world four years ago with only a basic art and design course. Two of her handbag designs were chosen for a major exhibition. Her bags, made in the UK, are always noticed. They are glamorous, made from fine calfskin or heavy silk. A mix of style and quality makes a Grimson bag special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He says most women want natural-looking hair that is easy to manage at home. His unique approach ensures clients don't look like they just left a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain. She also provides floral ideas to top restaurants. She has no formal training in floristry and left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her simple yet modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She advises keeping flower arrangements simple and strong, with few leaves. For wedding bouquets, she says the flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this hotel. This allowed them to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like guest preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. 

Room temperature is a common complaint from hotel guests worldwide. At the Merrion, a high-tech system lets guests adjust the temperature within a small range themselves. Additionally, the front desk can change the room temperature between 14°C and 25°C. 

Business travelers will appreciate the technology in the rooms. MacCann believes that up to 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables. TVs are rented, so they can be updated easily, and DVD recorders can be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this technology, the rooms are designed to be comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. 

The food at the hotel must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He got to design a new, modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel benefits by having a popular restaurant without financial risks. 

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to succeed."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her house is surrounded by a large garden, which gives her many of her painting subjects. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures, especially in the two long flower borders along the path that goes from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden. We got along well. At first, he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" about some plants I wanted, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood.'

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, 'I don't set everything up at once. I take one flower and paint it, which might take a few days, then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She is also fascinated by how flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, 'you bring them in, put them in water, and after a day, they form different shapes. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change with twists and turns.'

Susan has always loved plants. 'I studied botany at school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked like fake ones made of silk or plastic. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was amazed by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem as comfortable in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This changed how the town center looked, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been upset too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forgetful and bad-tempered. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy to get his medicine and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when the medicine started working and he felt better, that he realized the walnut tree was gone and the living room looked different. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The garden made it feel private. But now, the storm had changed things. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it made nice patterns of light and shade that hid the old furniture they brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was also bad. The tall house next door, which the tree had hidden, was now visible with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It had many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"Living in the Valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling up and was close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded the nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow and usually everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only occasional overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the large clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviewing—novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything he was asked to do for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and TV. Tom hired him, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his staff. 

At first, Tom's idea was to have a team of critics handle art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose what artistic material to cover, and there would be guests to make it more social. It all felt like a dream then: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It felt just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help him personally and was pretending to employ him. This showed his lack of self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with one of his reviews, he didn't know where to look.

Tom's original plan for a team of critics never worked out. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to link a reviewer with one subject area, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have come up with the current arrangement, where Mark writes a long weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him well. He wouldn't have been interested in the usual film critic's role, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That routine would make him bored quickly. He would soon be sitting in his seat on a Monday morning with a sigh, ""What boring rubbish must I watch now?""—a type of sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide.

The space he is given allows him to expand his argument—or forces him, in a dull week, to make something out of nothing. But what is his role in the public space? He assumes people choose films based on the stars, the publicity, or the director. There is also loyalty to a 'type' of film or its opposite. It rarely happens that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a fan of love stories avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say. So if a film review isn't really a guide for consumers, what is it? He doesn't feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. Nor does he think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All he has to do is present an argument. He's not a judge, and he doesn't want to be."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because she thinks it's fun. A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner. The partner should be a sports enthusiast, preferably female, and interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoys winter training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (likes 100km rides). The ability to do all three without resting is important. 

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It attracts large crowds who are amazed by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km without stopping. But why do triathletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a smart 17-year-old girl, with excellent grades, choose this challenging sport? 

Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that athletes often use. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then get on your bike while still wet, which makes you cold. After cycling 40km, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you're tired. But it's great fun and worth it in the end.""

Melanie did her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, although she was the only junior competing. Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. She had the second-fastest swim and the fastest run but didn't place well because she got lost during the cycling part and ended up cycling 20km too far. She cried during the run but didn't give up and is determined to keep going. 

Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching, admires her determination. He says, ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard on the running machine that it threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, but unlike most people who stop when they can't go further, she kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running but slower in cycling. That's why she's working hard on it. She is trying to convince her parents to buy her a £2,000 bike for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, hoping to improve her cycling.

Her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I keep in touch with the other girls in the team by phone and letters."" 

What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about the times we're achieving."" Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon 'sprint,' which is shorter. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's surprising, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about her love for collecting things and why many people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults taking part. It's a world full of passion and excitement. But if you want to start collecting, remember: only collect things you truly love.

People have been collecting since ancient times. Early humans collected pebbles for their beauty and wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for the same reason.

I have been a collector all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. My parents would take me to a local museum filled with interesting objects from the past, which fascinated me.

Many people share my interest in collecting. The reasons for collecting are varied. Some people collect because it gives them a sense of control. For me, it's simply something I enjoy.

Famous collectors include the Duc de Berry in France, who had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't need to be rich to collect. I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a tulip I wanted, but it was later stolen by another collector.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next day, I was sad to see the remains of my furniture and collection.

I'm interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet becomes valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. Sadly, I threw away both the boxes and the toys."
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work: Four People Talk About Their Jobs**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. First, I learn about the exhibition topic and talk to experts to decide on the main themes and goals. I choose which objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure everything is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents for students to learn the routes needed for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are learning how to plan journeys. They find the most direct route using the correct one-way streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When students are close to the test, I challenge them by asking for different routes, even if they have to think of new ways because of road closures. This helps them think better.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but mostly I am by the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out on a boat to help them understand sea life better. This often changes their views because it is different from just looking at a computer screen. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. However, since I work for a charity, we always need more money, so I can't do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books we publish. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and these need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, the four of us spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have added to the building, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it's quite a coincidence. ""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" These are the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that, while her husband handles redecoration and repairs. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and then returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June, Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the cliff path to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we developed this routine. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is in her second year working as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. Known as Pilch, she works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors staying in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a long-term career but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to meet successful people every week,' she adds.

Sarah doesn't live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing a full breakfast for the guests, including porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After the guests finish breakfast by around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys skiing as much as possible. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.'

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she avoids napping. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans up and loads the dishwasher. 'I hate coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,' she says. Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week fantastic, but some weeks don't go as well.'

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We usually start at Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps end the night at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. However, Sarah doesn't stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. 'It's a tough day,' she says, 'and you don't want to cook breakfast with a bad headache.'

On Sundays, work starts earlier because breakfast for departing guests must be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet thoroughly. 'We clean everything - clear breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready.' If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I think the mountain air affects them,' she jokes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it's time for dinner again, and maybe a drink afterward, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,' she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was about six years older. She visited Seymour's factory one day. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a lot of curly hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if he thought the student was very serious, by giving them a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, these children had visited the factory from their rural school, 50 kilometers away, so Marie's father could show them how he made gloves. He showed them Marie's favorite spot, the laying-off table, where workers shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'.

Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it into the right kind of leather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' Rita said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered, 'Well, you need to visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you if you'd like. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. It's said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; he's the one you should talk to. Start him talking about gloves, and he'll go on for two days. That's typical: people in the glove trade love everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' Rita replied, 'I can't say I have.' Seymour asked, 'Never seen anything made?' Rita said, 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. She was innocent but eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. Marie had a good-natured intelligence that filled the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned. She remembered everything, neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. Seymour said, 'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to show you the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,"**Is it a tough job?** Chris Arnot talks to four people with dream jobs to see if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. However, she has one small problem - she doesn't like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork, like organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance, which led to a job offer. She took a secretarial course in the evenings at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy because he loves golf. However, there are some downsides. Caddies get a small fixed fee plus a percentage of the golfer's winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first worked as a caddy for the golfer Greg Norman. ""You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the golf course."" His skills in accountancy were noticed by European Tour Productions, who made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies' scorecards for each day's play. These results are wanted by TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers themselves.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food at the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember forever than buy a microwave."" His talent as a cook led to an offer to write a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director at an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession."" He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his weight under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. ""Before that, I always loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a story called 'The Fox Busters,' which was my first published children's story."" Where do his ideas come from? ""Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,"" he says. ""That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not an early riser, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend a couple more hours typing out the morning's notes - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter instead of on a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that's the part of being a writer that I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were made into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles covered the yard all the way to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof onto the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to follow him. Laughing, he watched them from the roof, looking scared, but one by one, they jumped and felt relieved. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one friend said, ""Let's go up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and jumped off again, except for Michael. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the roof, nervous and smiling awkwardly, wondering why it seemed so high this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and then jumping, but it didn't work. He tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. After a while, his friends started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour as the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating nervously. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to come home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, barely heard her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy with your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change jobs are now turning to careers advisers. These advisers ask you to write a short history of yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, they give you a summary of the results and suggest different careers, along with any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a big company that offers career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was with about ten other people, answering questions quickly. I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I had a long talk with an adviser. Using the test results and our conversation, he wrote a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, although I was a bit upset to learn I didn't do well in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. It's probably good that I never became a nurse. However, it was comforting to hear that I made the right choice in becoming a journalist.

Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company after five years. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts for help. 'Losing my job was a great chance to step back and review my career,' says Donna. Some results surprised her. 'I didn't know I had a talent for design. But I had to consider the cost of retraining in design against my financial needs,' she says. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my existing skills and move into something better suited for me than insurance. Now, I work as a Public Relations officer. I might have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to several friends, who are all happy with the service.'

Some people feel they wouldn't have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make big life changes. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and needed a new challenge. I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course in it later this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier now and more positive.'

However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I reached a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many new ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary cut or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"Title: 'Enjoying Your Visit to the Dentist?'

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you'll notice bright paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit during their check-ups. Jerome explains that half of the people only visit the dentist when they are in pain because they are scared. To change this, he has created a friendly environment to help people feel less afraid. He doesn't wear a white coat because he believes it reminds people of pain. Jerome thinks dental visits should be relaxing, interesting, and even enjoyable.

This idea might surprise many people who usually think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome believes that if patients are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their past bad experiences. One of his new methods is using virtual-reality headsets. His practice was the first in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Jerome examines their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth, which most patients find interesting.

Another important feature of Jerome's office is the pleasant smell, like a perfume shop, instead of the usual dental smell. Today, it smells like oranges. Jerome says he wants people to use all their senses to realize that his office is different from a typical dentist's. He believes smell is important because the usual dental smell can make people nervous.

Although Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but the quality of treatment is the most important. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It might feel strange at first, but it doesn't hurt if you are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. He discovered that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for dentists. He believes his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a change towards less formal dentistry in Britain.

As a patient arrives, Jerome greets him, offers tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it's easy to see why. Jerome's office feels more like a fancy beauty salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,"Title: The Rise of Chocolate

Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a huge global business. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought at this time, with only Christmas seeing more chocolate consumption. 

Chocolate production on a large scale began in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a spelling mistake from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar as we know it started in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. Later, a Swiss company added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add some French style. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, first called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular with clever advertising linking it to the healthy milk from the English countryside. This made it a strong competitor to the French brands.

Today, chocolate consumption in Britain is about four bars each week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers, like turning chocolate bars into ice creams, soft drinks, or desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices from the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke, at 83 years old, has become very skilled in his art. He still wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the last ten years. 

As he shows me around his apartment, he says, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" However, Peter is not boring at all. He is enthusiastic, charming, and his work is beautiful. He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace and says, ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I love them. I never planned to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends visited and said, 'You should have an exhibition. People need to see these. We'll talk to an art gallery owner.'""

This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The pieces are expensive, with some ornaments costing around £2,000. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he doesn't set the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else in the world makes work like his. The gallery owner told him, ""One day you'll stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more.""

Peter wishes he had started this art earlier in life. He feels he could have created even more amazing things. Although he still has ideas, he finds himself more physically limited now than when he began. Despite this, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which has led to creating boxes covered in tiny shells, small pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers.

Peter has developed his own method and uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" but the detail, color, and symmetry in his work show it is not accidental.

His search for beautiful, especially tiny, shells has taken him beyond the Norfolk shore to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people crushing them with their feet faster than I can collect them; and the sea breaks up the rest. I would never collect shells with living creatures in them or dive for them, but once they are empty, why shouldn't I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially when considering the beauty of his work compared to the natural shells."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer isn't traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, she's probably studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm sorry, Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I was trying to ignore all the negative things I had read about models, like being difficult, vain, and unintelligent. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided going to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira wasn't wearing expensive designer clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. She didn't seem selfish at all; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mum, very proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. Her older sister was the one who decided she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When she got the call saying she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she did great. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Kira now finds it hard to balance her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, some unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This must be hard for Kira, as she is not self-important. But she says, ""They think that because I've become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even finish their school exams. As I finish the interview with the girl who has it all, I ask what she would like to do if she didn't have the beauty that seems sure to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat to find valuable metals. Terence, an explorer, and his son Chris, a mineral expert, think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find a lot of gold; we just need to dig a few more meters to reach where it is concentrated.""

The Maddens have spent their lives searching for gold. Their journey began when Terence read about gold worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing the land and finding small pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running out of money. They have used their savings to follow their dream and need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it seems difficult, but we have some people we can contact.""

As news about the dig spread last week, the idea of finding gold excited both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would bring more people here if they are right, but if they find gold, I hope millions won't come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, like finding hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she goes on dives in a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to explore underwater volcanoes three kilometers deep in the ocean. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can easily touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they can't stand or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button to release a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested this yet, and it might not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was setting up scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers,"" another name for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a speed of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel recalls being scared once when she was diving with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest parts of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere under all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more stress. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign schedules, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere I wanted in Europe. Once you've learned to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds never feel the same. The train's rhythm rocks you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to throwing away socks that are too smelly and getting rid of books when you're done with them. This way of thinking fits the spirit of Inter-Rail, where common sense and reasoning can be ignored, just like the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to feel this free is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I didn't realize the possibilities of this train ticket at first. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting because there was always just one more country over the border, always a little further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in planning our own schedule, we left out everything except the most easily available sights. This was a chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I was proud that, in many places, all I bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of a place that was just a name before. It's as if the city you arrive in never really existed until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and noticing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everyone knows what's there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos are so boring. While the train trip won't let you discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to realize this, though in our case, it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your baggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Airlines don't often say how many bags they lose, but regular travelers know that losing luggage happens sometimes. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will always be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes. 

Here's how the system works: Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to go through the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, the system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights, which can cause the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with most moving between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports. Even in the United States, Miami airport is known for luggage going missing when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who knows a lot about kingfishers. These are beautiful blue-green birds that live near streams and rivers and eat fish. The area where they live has old trees that hang over the water, creating a mix of soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher moves quickly and directly through this scene, like a flash of light. It disappears in a moment, but the image stays in your mind because of its strong impact.

Charlie fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He can't quite explain why he is so drawn to them, but they are part of many legends. In Greek mythology, a kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top turned blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. Scientifically, kingfishers don't have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, their feathers reflect light in a way that makes them look blue or green, depending on the light.

Many wildlife photographers are fascinated by kingfishers. They are colorful and, although they avoid people, they can be watched from a hidden spot. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket he used to cover himself while waiting for a kingfisher. The bird came close, but it took him four years to take a good picture. During this time, he spent as much time as possible by a stream full of kingfishers, even skipping school, which affected his studies. However, his passion for kingfishers was noticed, and at 16, he became an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant editor and then became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Charlie dreams of making the perfect kingfisher film, with no words, just beautiful images. He loves the simple approach and enjoys photographing parts of the kingfisher's wings. Even after spending so much time with these birds, they still fascinate him. His photos show some of his feelings, but he knows there is more to his connection with kingfishers than his work can express."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she asked to watch Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna. She ended up replacing an absent assistant and later helped with another opera. ""I wasn't nervous,"" she says. ""I've always been comfortable leading an orchestra."" Manson, originally from the US, works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has worked with Abbado on several projects since then.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after failing in two others. ""If I had won earlier, I might not have succeeded,"" he reflects. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition. ""If in three years I'm still just the 'competition winner,' I'll be concerned,"" he says. ""But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting me back, which is a good sign.""

Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods in opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Learning from Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""Seeing someone my size conduct was inspiring,"" she explains. She appreciates the complexity of opera, including managing singers' personalities.

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly fascinating. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, a new experience for him. ""It was easier than I thought,"" he says. ""I knew the music and what I wanted it to sound like."" Vignoles values his musical experience and is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys.

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, then a young assistant, and recommended him. Marshall, now 32, quickly found himself conducting a musical in London with little preparation. He even had to deal with musicians who were not paying attention. ""I was firm with them,"" he says. ""I always gave a clear beat and got the best results I could."" Marshall has never formally studied conducting but is confident and knows what he likes. ""If people see you're worried, it gets worse,"" he advises."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you want to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try out some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns family**

Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with its exciting trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and closed their eyes, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is great for younger children. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small, which was a relief for us! The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge family**

We arrived at 1 p.m. and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**

The park advertises 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very noticeable, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, and the older children went on them several times. Sarah was too small for a few rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but not all were welcoming. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared to tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"Running a Business in the Countryside: Five Women Share Their Stories

A. Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly income of over £200,000 and four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Having worked with computers before marriage, her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. Christine was careful with spending and informed the bank if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, and local customers usually pick up their work.

B. Maggy Sasanow enjoys being independent and works from home designing greeting cards. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no such jobs in the countryside where she moved after marriage. So, she started her own business, creating 50 different greeting cards sold to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is the constant chores, like mowing the lawn. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. People send work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more advantages than disadvantages.

C. Delia Turner has faced challenges with her curtain-making business. She started eight years ago when the business was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She managed six full-time workers but had to let them go due to the economy's decline, which was hard because jobs are scarce in the area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and hires women who work from their homes. Delia is ready to lower prices when needed and explore new opportunities.

D. Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the country. Tessa enjoys flexible working hours. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to stop working. She publishes children's books from different cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely because all her professional experience was in London.

E. Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly income of £250,000, employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, interested in health, making fruit cakes with quality ingredients. Friends and relatives began requesting cakes, and soon she was sending them nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made by a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg no longer cooks but manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as they didn't have much money to start with."
FCE_1,"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The Watkins family is special because the sons are talented musicians and composers, and their father makes musical instruments. This is not something you see every day. John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, because he was getting really good at playing. But buying a cello was too expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one myself."" He found out about the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years.

After trying to make violins and violas a few times, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. Dad made me another one later, and I used it until a few months ago."" John has now retired from teaching to make instruments full-time. He makes up to twelve violins a year and even sold one to the famous American violinist Jaime Laredo, which was a big achievement for him.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were very young. Paul first played the piano: ""As soon as I was big enough to reach the keys, I started playing,"" he remembers. But soon, he wanted to play the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin because they needed another violinist for their music group. Paul tried the violin for six weeks but didn't like it. He was inspired by the cellist in his dad's group and started taking cello lessons from him.

Huw, now 22, is also making a name for himself as a pianist and composer. He says, ""My parents were supportive and relaxed. I wouldn't have liked being pushed. Instead of feeling jealous of Paul's success, I saw it as something to aim for.""

Paul's cello, made by his dad, helped him win the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul says, ""Dad hasn't said anything about me using a new cello, but he did admit that my new one is quite nice!"" The new cello is 304 years old and has a powerful sound that can fill large concert halls.

Paul will soon be on television playing the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto for a new series called Masterworks. He says, ""The history of the performance doesn't change how I play. I always play it my way."" However, Paul won't be able to watch himself on TV because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall the same evening. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. 

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. This is important because wardens work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his family's farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden job on the Lleyn Peninsula, but Gareth got it because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. He says it's helpful that he still farms with his parents, so he understands farmers' problems and can relate to them.

Gareth's farming background also helps him with the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes now that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault because they were following government advice.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. Gareth believes they are close to working together. Conservation is a big part of Gareth's work, along with allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He enjoys seeing projects completed, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, even though he is always on duty. He especially enjoys talking to the public, although he finds some people's attitudes frustrating. They sometimes act like they own the place, which annoys him. But as Gareth says, it's all about common sense. If you have a lot of common sense and like working outdoors, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. However, don't expect a job to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day like she has had for weeks before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't people look at you strangely?"" She replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down from the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

""My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships,"" says Kendra. ""I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible."" These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have support from home, which is very special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Because we're playing here, there will be more pressure than usual. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but it will be exciting to play them. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there's no rest between games like in a series. You can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready to make the most of it.""

In the fifteen years she has been playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. ""You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,"" says Kendra. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It's essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.""

""From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,"" she says. ""So I decided some time ago that this competition would be the end of my playing career."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is likely to have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should you help a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always easy to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. While most schools can handle children who are very good at academic subjects, musically talented children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a main focus there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

There are five specialist music schools in Britain, which are quite new. They offer a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one-third to half of their day on music activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and second instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours a day in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. However, students can study more subjects if they want.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high number of teachers compared to students. Most children at these schools are boarders, meaning they live at the school full-time. This allows them to spend their important growing years with others who have similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One clear issue is the cost; boarding fees are high (between £12,000 and £17,000 a year). However, schools try to help parents of very talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors are unsure about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their main goal is to develop 'well-rounded and balanced individuals.'

There is a risk that separating musically gifted children from others at an early age can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a feeling of failure. But specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and offer help if needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the excellent music teaching, some worry about the limited academic program, which is less important than music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very smart and can handle academic challenges, so they might feel frustrated if their academic needs aren't met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before choosing a specialist education. Those who are also good at academics might do well in a less specialized school with a strong music department or by combining regular school with music training at a junior music college. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with great teachers and experience in orchestras and chamber music. However, this option might not be possible for families who don't live near London or other big cities."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her house is surrounded by a large garden, which gives her many of her painting subjects. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures, especially in the two long flower borders along the path that goes from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well. At first, Danny didn't agree with some of the plants Susan wanted, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood her vision.

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She doesn't arrange everything at once. Instead, she paints one flower at a time, which can take a few days, and then adds another flower to the painting. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. ""They all bloom together, and you're so busy,"" she says. She is also fascinated by how flowers change as they decay. For example, tulips change shape when left in water for a day. They open up and look amazing. At first, they might seem boring in a vase, but they change with twists and turns.

Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She preferred wildflowers because they grew in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"Title: Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is in her second year working as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. Known as Pilch, she works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors staying in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a long-term career but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah doesn't live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After the guests finish breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is ""the worst part of the job."" By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can, sometimes until 4:30 p.m.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she doesn't nap. ""It's fatal if you do,"" she says. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans up and loads the dishwasher. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she says. Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. ""Good guests can make a week brilliant, but some weeks don't go quite so well,"" she says.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,"" she says. However, Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""A frightful day,"" she says, ""when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted."" Work starts earlier on Sunday, with breakfast for guests ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. ""We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready."" If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. ""I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them,"" she says. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests needing boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it's time for dinner duty again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,"" she says."
FCE_12,"**Changing Lives with a Stranger**

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't usually stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking that I would normally be cleaning cages or handling rats. I find magazines interesting, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in leather boots and dark blue trousers. They gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, because of my shifts, I don't see daylight. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I was more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint, but I was surprised that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it was very satisfying.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different—people suddenly respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was surprised at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see that some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Journey Memories**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It offers amazing views of the sea. No matter the weather or time of year, it's always beautiful. From the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unreliable—we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train appeared, hundreds of people rushed to get on, even climbing onto the roof for free. At night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite train memories as children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important to me. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming was on an old, unused part of the line, maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I returned last year, it felt like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Are you trying to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, has some advice for you. Many readers ask us, ""I've written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" The first thing you need to do is research the market and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Selling your writing requires understanding the publishing world. No matter what you write, you need to know the market you are targeting. The best way to do this is by reading as much as you can. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what publishers are looking for at any time. Keep updating your knowledge because new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. 

If you're not sure what to write, let's say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories and get recent copies. Learn what kind of stories they buy and who their readers are. Editors focus on what their readers want. Writers often ask me, ""My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone, but the work might not be ready for publishing. Most new writers send their work too soon, before they are ready. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. 

When you send your work for the first time, start writing more stories while waiting for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more. Each one will be better, and you'll start seeing yourself as a writer. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I also suggest not showing your work to others, especially at the beginning. Remember, every successful writer faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible."
FCE_4,"On the last day of a difficult year, I was at the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. The station was busier than I expected. Usually, it felt airy and clean, but now it was crowded. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. 

A well-dressed, grey-haired man was walking around, talking to strangers. He looked wealthy, with tanned skin and nice clothes. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her something. Then he came to a girl near me with long blond hair. I had thought about talking to her myself. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

She replied, ""I'm going north, yes."" 

""But to Philadelphia?"" he asked again. 

""No, New York,"" she said, ""but I'll be..."" 

""Thanks, anyway,"" he said and moved on. Now, I was curious. I heard him ask an old lady, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She said she was going to Wilmington, and he moved on to another couple. 

I stood up and moved closer, pretending to look at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me. I guessed he thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then walked away, looking stressed. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" 

She looked up from her book. She seemed about thirty-five, older than me, and like a schoolteacher. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Could I ask you a favor?"" he asked. 

I stopped nearby, pretending to check my watch, even though I didn't have one. I could tell she was cautious. The man noticed too and said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 

They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, pulling their bags. I heard the man explain, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, then went shopping, and when I got home, my wife was upset. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the Philadelphia station, not knowing what to do."" 

The woman listened sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet to see what he wanted. 

""So I told her to stay there, and I would find someone here to take her passport,"" he said. 

I thought it was suspicious. Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? 

""Why don't you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair,"" he replied. 

This seemed like a weak excuse to me. It was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a padded envelope, not a regular one, which seemed odd. It was the size of a paperback book and looked stapled shut. I thought to myself, ""Be careful, lady."""
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef.

I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory, and I was upset because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife focused on taking care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This has been very good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.

Gary was a very active child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into our corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs, and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had a lot of money at school. He was disciplined. He used to wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was excellent in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He would make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he had a talent for it. So when he told me, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for my school course,' I sent him to a friend who has a restaurant.

Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can do well. He understood when I told him: 'Gary, if you want to achieve something in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it might be too late.'

Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He had prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping other people. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. I'm very proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one gives you anything for free. He saw the opportunity he was given and took it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even ten percent of what you've told them, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding a good flat in Dublin at an affordable price was very difficult, like finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often helped. But if you were new to Dublin, like Jo, you had no personal contacts and no one to tell you about available places. So, you had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going; everyone at her school assumed she would leave. Who would stay in a small, boring town? That's what she heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, see the world, and have a real life. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle. But no one from Jo's year was going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed in the hostel permanently because it was run by nuns and safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn't know they were still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a long line for this flat because it was more like 'Third Girl Wanted' than 'Flat to Let.' The mention of 'own television' made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who had obviously been rejected, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Pauline was a punk, which amazed Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but never talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work at the post office, and I called about the flat.' Nessa said they were about to have tea and offered Jo a mug. One mug had 'Nessa,' another had 'Pauline,' and the third had 'Other' written on it. 'We'll put your name on it if you stay,' Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,"People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them at seaside marinas, in movies, and on TV. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are declining. Dolphins are special to us because they are very intelligent, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" have made us love them even more. But these shows don't show the real problems dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas today. 

For example, the number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine areas, but this is not true. Without plans to protect them, dolphins might face one of the biggest wildlife disasters ever.

There are 40 different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two types usually live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups. We don't know much about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in places like Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress.

It's hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are going down because their habits are complex. Overfishing is a big problem because it reduces fish stocks, which dolphins need to eat. If fish are caught in one area, dolphins may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they can't see. Modern fishing uses large nets that float or are pulled quickly through the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall, showing marks and cuts from these nets.

Pollution is another problem. Waste in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them. These poisons can then be passed to their young through milk. There is a case where a young dolphin died from its mother's poisoned milk.

The most debated threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. Noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better in water than in air, which might disturb dolphins in ways we don't yet understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but it's really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise and not many reasons not to, for most people.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It increases muscle power and helps you stand or sit with good posture. Good posture is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. Exercise also helps prevent muscle problems that can cause injuries. It can quickly improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It also makes your heart, lungs, and blood circulation better.

You might have heard these reasons many times and feel bored. But here's something interesting: exercise can help with depression and tiredness, and it helps you sleep better. It also helps control stress and can improve some medical conditions. By now, you should see that exercise is good for you. Even common sense tells you this.

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, lifting free weights, or using weight machines. Remember, training too hard or with too much weight can cause injuries, so start slowly and carefully. If you're unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is important for your body shape. A stiff or sagging body doesn't look good, lacks energy, and can have minor health problems. If you slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This helps lift your chest for better breathing and makes your body look slimmer. When standing, if your chest is balanced, you should be able to see your ankles.

Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps you move easily. It also helps you keep good posture and prevents muscle injuries. Stretching four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit. So, stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine. Do it slowly and carefully.

The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? It's their search for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest people to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had almost continuous rain for six months, causing unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive tool so that when their vehicle gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull it out. Their teamwork has created some of TV's best wildlife films, like their popular film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's shyest cats was being shown, they were already back in the wild, this time following the equally shy jackal.

This is common in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been going around the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I talked to Newman about their partnership while he was briefly meeting other people at a safari lodge. 'We sometimes argue, but we get over it quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they both view animals in a similar way. 'When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.' Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so food can be a bit of a worry,' says Newman. It can be tough, but being alone in remote areas lets them get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman remembers filming a lion family where one lioness would greet their car as part of her routine.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later, they went to film Arctic foxes as a team. Since then, they spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create films rich in atmosphere that bring the true spirit of the place and animals to life and touch people's hearts. I believe it's better to evoke an emotional response from people than to appeal only to their minds.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is preparing for the World Championships next month. Her typical day includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location and asked if people stare. She said, ""I'm too focused on my movements and feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that's it.""

Kendra's life is all about being her best for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to get fit. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure and expectations from the home crowd. People expect us to start well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" England is ranked fourth in the world, but the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance.""

In her 15 years of playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the game, we're all friendlier.""

Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. As captain, she believes in having a strong mental attitude and leading by example. She supports and encourages her team.

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, teaching and researching marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers down into the ocean in a small steel vehicle to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very tight. Rachel can touch the two pilots sitting next to her. They can't stand up or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive lasts about 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.

If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant ride.

Rachel remembers her first dive. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, she has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, they studied a large area of underwater volcanoes, where black smoke comes out of the chimneys. The Russian team was setting up equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When Rachel isn't at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. The water flows at one meter per second and is 350 degrees hot.

Rachel was only scared once, during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. But nothing happened, and they were relieved to be safe.

Diving to the ocean's deepest parts is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she sees the chimneys through the porthole, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing things no one else has seen before. After studying black smokers for her Ph.D. for three years, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best."" Many people forget how important it is to have a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't even get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before applying again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't matter.""

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job immediately. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't refuse. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have gotten more if I had controlled my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company's activities. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in bullet points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I didn't plan to leave for another five or ten years, but I was suddenly made redundant. I didn't get a big payout, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm happy not to be in an office anymore, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counselor I spoke to was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We moved to the north of England, where we knew no one. It meant leaving our friends, but our friendships have survived the distance—many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**  
After working for five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients. ""Being a lawyer was fun and paid well, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that never happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and seasons, so you need a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss socializing with colleagues, but I love being responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, it's my fault. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I've always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you can't party late at night. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it's worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a job presenting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in style, and sometimes people say we act childishly, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters often care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home, hang out with friends, and do normal things. You can't focus on the sport all the time; it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I've only been recognized in public a few times. I wouldn't want to be a big celebrity. I get nice letters from people asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on the court. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans, but I still enjoy being recognized when I'm out shopping. However, it can be difficult. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport and be professional. It doesn't bother me too much now. I'm happy to focus on my game and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says it's very hard because her children want everything they see. They ask for things like sugary cereals, Disney videos, and comics. She can't afford all these things and feels bad about buying unhealthy food. She also feels guilty for saying no all the time and gets upset even before they leave the house. She tries not to take them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. She feels like she can't win.

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when the ads are so convincing.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with advertisers and feel bad about disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, the goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something, even if they can't directly tell children to ask their parents.

Some parents find it stressful to decide which of their children's requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements. Her son is critical of ads, and they look at labels together. Because of this, they have fewer arguments in the supermarket.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of two, says they refuse to buy sweets for their son because it's unhealthy, but they buy treats for themselves. He says it's normal for children to want nice things, but he still gets annoyed by their demands. His response depends on his mood; if he's feeling good, he's more likely to say yes. It's hard to always be consistent.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without their children's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this hotel. This allowed them to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like guest preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can record guest preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint in hotels. At the Merrion, a high-tech system lets guests adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in any room between 14°C and 25°C. 

Business travelers will appreciate the technology in the rooms. MacCann expects 65% of the hotel's business to come from this market. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be updated easily. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this technology, the rooms are designed to be comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the hotel must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This benefits both him and the hotel. He got to design a new, modern kitchen and has better parking facilities. The hotel benefits by having a popular restaurant without financial risks.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to succeed."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share how they do it.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I think excitement gives me energy. I need to be doing something challenging. When I'm learning something new, I feel full of energy. Anything with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, also energizes me. Dance is wonderful and expressive. If you're bored, you might feel tired and think life is pointless. Being effective, even in small ways, gives you energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a chore. If you like what you do, you won't feel down, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep to feel great. When I only get six hours, I feel a bit tired. Exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to start. I do yoga once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I get tired in the office between 3 and 5 PM, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily for energy; I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I can't stand negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and live in the moment. Enjoyment is important. You need to set goals and achieve them. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with lively young people, which is energizing. I enjoy taking photos and writing imaginary song lyrics for fun. It's a good way to relax my mind when traveling.""

**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do at work and home. Being positive helps. I love working with kids because they are full of energy and resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical that comes from interacting with others. Smiling at people and getting a smile back is thrilling. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise plan. I get active by playing with kids.""

FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. People used these bone skates until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was stylish and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie showed a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can only go faster as you get better. Your body position is key to keeping balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your body weight. This means your body leans a little forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It's quite easy, right? As you practice, you can slowly make your movements longer.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should learn. Even the best skaters fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall. This reduces the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up. Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is to learn figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves and then the turns, jumps, and spins of freestyle.

If you watch a good or professional skater, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this, you should practice an exercise program regularly. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises are important. Focus on exercises for the legs, back, and shoulders, especially the ankles and knees. After a long or hard session, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very emotional. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15,** won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard right now. I don't have time to watch TV, hang out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to focus on each day. When I'm extremely tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

**B. Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People often say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she's met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""

**C. Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love show-jumping events; they are exciting and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

**D. Sarah's mother** says, ""Sarah's passion for horses started when she was 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, you have to compete all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happiest on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10,** is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting a big head. I don't talk about my success at school because I don't like being embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game at 5. My father suggested it, and she loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop tomorrow, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to put her down because she's exceptional. If she has this gift, she should reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"It's true - we're all getting taller

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More and more tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're becoming a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from when we were cavemen. We are now overcoming the effects of generations of poor diet, which is having a big impact. ""We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,"" says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. ""We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many different sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. This lifestyle is still followed by the few remaining tribes of hunter-gatherers. One study found that they ate 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, farming was invented, which had serious consequences. Most green areas on the planet have been taken over by farmers, and now just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has badly affected human health and growth. Over the centuries, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Some anthropologists say corn was a public health disaster, not a blessing of the New World. However, farming spread because it could support ten times more people than hunting and gathering. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by wealthier countries. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now similar to our ancestors' rich diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it also brings problems. Heights have increased, but the world hasn't changed much. Standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers have to keep updating their products. The question is: where will it all end? We can't grow forever. There must be a natural limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller because of better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller, which helped them stay warm. Since the climate has warmed, we have become slightly thinner and smaller, even with good nutrition. As the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even more. In other words, global warming could counteract the growth of human beings."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences: What It's Like to Be in One**

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a regular part of TV life, but many people don't know much about them. When we see them getting excited on game shows, we might wonder, ""Who are these people?""

Some people think studio audiences are not very important. I've heard that even TV workers don't respect them much. One cameraman said they treat them ""like cattle."" I used to think studio audiences were just people looking for a quick moment of fame. But actually, there's no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life, different jobs, and income levels. TV shows try to attract different kinds of people for different programs.

Many of us who watch TV at home can't understand why someone would want to watch it in a studio. Why would anyone get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch something they can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came because it was a chance to be on TV. Another reason is that people are curious to see what happens behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was simply, ""a friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit close to strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when told. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, ""We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is ""more exciting,"" and Charlotte liked feeling involved with live TV. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you see him on TV at home, you miss out on a lot."" What I missed was seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were filmed so far away that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

I don't like wild landscapes without any human touch. I find the human element important. When I travel, I prefer lovely villages with old temples over empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, the landscape felt familiar but different, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery isn't spectacular. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and along a canal. But I always look forward to one part of the journey when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we can see people doing everyday things like making tea or doing the dishes. I see myself as a woman in a tiny train, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinary landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer to find something that opens my eyes.

The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and full of rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to enjoy the sea's majesty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through beautiful damp valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many people living or visiting there. It's an unknown, empty, and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found the area by chance when I was a student, and since then, I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted pure peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"Title: A Day with Animals

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she found a beautiful pine snake. She asked if we could keep it, and I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals we found, so we could admire them and learn about them from our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting for help from their bedroom. I rushed in to find our cat, Domino, with a white mouse in his mouth. The mouse was a Mother's Day gift for me. Domino was running around the room, trying to find a place to enjoy his catch, while the kids were waving their arms to stop him. I tried to help but tripped and fell on the floor. As I was thinking about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank.

The room was chaotic with the cat, mouse, kids, and now the snake all moving around. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen was boiling over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the room. I managed to catch Domino by the tail and saved the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life.

Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I turned my attention to the snake. It was difficult to handle, but I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed, and I carefully picked it up. I took it to the end of the garden and pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would leave. But instead, the snake wrapped itself around my shoulders like a scarf.

We stood there, my four children, the snake, and I, in the evening light. My eldest, DJ, explained why the snake stayed with me: ""You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it finally climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed it up for all of us: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Send me a letter! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old way of writing letters is disappearing. But for me, getting a letter is special and different from any other way of communicating. There is the excitement when it arrives, the joy of seeing who sent it, and finally, the pleasure of reading it. Writing letters has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. My mother always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote once a week, and so did my mother. Sometimes my father wrote, and it was always fun to get his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday things happening with my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but I remember the letters most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I often had boyfriends who had to work or study far away, and we could only stay in touch by writing letters. But instead of hurting the relationships, writing letters seemed to make them better. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can improve my French (she doesn't speak English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a friendship could last so long through letters. The local newspaper even thought it was important enough to put on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

In the French Alps, at Mont Bego, there are tens of thousands of ancient rock carvings. These carvings, which are about 4,000 years old, include pictures of cows with horns, fields, and gods and goddesses. Scientists are worried because these important drawings are being damaged quickly by careless tourists. They fear that if this continues, the drawings might not be there for future generations.

The site, once a place for prayer and worship, is now popular with tourists. Unfortunately, some visitors are ruining the carvings with graffiti. Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says that people think the drawings will last forever, but at this rate, they might disappear in 50 years. He has seen tourists walking on the drawings, which wears them down. Some even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. When tourists can't take good photos, they rub the drawings to make them clearer, which damages them further. Some visitors also scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.

Experts have different ideas on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way is to close the mountain to the public, except for guided tours. He believes this will save the site and allow important research to continue. However, Jean Clottes disagrees, saying that this strict measure will upset local people. He believes they should do everything possible to protect the site without closing it completely.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He thinks the best solution is to let people visit but admits it's hard to stop them from causing damage because the area is large. He suggests charging a fee to help pay for guards, but there is no government funding available.

Annie Echassoux, another researcher, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach, more damage will occur. She suggests roping off the area and providing guides. She insists that money must be found to protect the site because it is classified as a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture. If nothing is done, future generations might lose these valuable drawings."
FCE_32,"Shopping with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says that when she takes her kids to the supermarket, they want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty if she buys them. But she also feels bad for saying no all the time. She tries not to take them shopping, but then worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a shopping trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when ads make products look so appealing.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell kids to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to make people want to buy products, so even if they can't directly tell kids to ask their parents, the ads still have that effect.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse can be stressful for parents. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements, so they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says he refuses to buy sweets for his son because they're unhealthy, even though he buys treats for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent because his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their kids aren't with them, the idea of shopping without their children's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,"Title: Climbing Walls: From Mountains to Indoors

In the past, climbers went to mountains to climb. Now, you can find challenging climbs both indoors and outdoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, the crowd watches as French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by his fingertips on a climbing wall. This arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, and both events feature a climbing wall. This is possible because of new technology that has developed quickly.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, top climbers needed to stay fit all year. When cliffs were not usable, they used brick or stone buildings to practice and keep their fingers strong.

Soon, sports centers started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls used bricks with special edges to hold onto. Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, built one of the first climbing walls in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He used natural rock set in concrete blocks for the wall. Many similar walls were built in sports halls during the 1970s, but they had design problems. They could only be built vertically, unlike natural cliffs that have overhangs and angled rocks. Also, once built, these walls couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the same holds.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like natural rock. These shapes could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls, but steel frames could be set up anywhere. This system allowed climbers to have endless new holds to try."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. And they are right; acting is a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your friends might say you're crazy, but others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But choosing to be an actor is a personal decision, and only you can be responsible for your choice and your dream. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even if you finish your training, there is no guarantee you will succeed. Success depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new faces and talent, and acting can be exciting, glamorous, and sometimes very rewarding. People often ask me to explain what talent is. I think talent is natural skill plus imagination, with imagination being the hardest to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is central to all acting and motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeeded, they might just shrug. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they don't take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and their fame might not last. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes, or waitressing. Suddenly, you get an audition, but even if you want the job badly, you might not get it. So, actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of competing for roles and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, the chance of rejection is there from the moment you start auditioning professionally. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it's up to you because if you don't care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

I'm happy not to be stuck in an office, but it's surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and I'm still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I realized it was more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy and becoming an artist seemed logical. The career counselor I spoke to was very helpful. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don't want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work immediately for money. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We moved to the north of England, where we didn't know anyone. It meant leaving all our friends, but we've been lucky that our friendships have survived the distance—many of them visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**  
After working for five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients. ""My job as a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were terrible. I realized I didn't want to become a senior partner, working even more hours, so I left. Many people said I'd get bored, but that never happened. The secret is to have deadlines. Since it's a fashion-related business, there are always collections, next year's styles, and the season—there's always too much to do, so you need a very organized schedule. I feel happier now and definitely less stressed. I do miss things like social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I'm totally responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, I'm the one to blame. Of course, you care when working for a company, but when your name is on the promotional material, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline, but the work was never rewarding. I was almost made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the world's best gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I never used to feel in control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That's the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Onto a Winner**

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with big beards, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, the family was playing the game almost every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, they were 'having the best time ever'. 

Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But they did not forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he made from old wooden food crates, and they kept playing regularly. When visitors came by, they were often interested because the game was unknown in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed the old pichenotte board was cracked and worn out, so he decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. Curious about how popular the game might be, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People there started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!'

When people started asking about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found out that the game probably started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. It was adapted into a game called 'squails' played in British pubs, and a century ago, British people moving to Canada brought the game with them. Pichenotte is the name of the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. Pichenotte, which can be played by two to four people, is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. Three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight tiny posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts just two minutes.

Seeing how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships began to take place, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards began to sell quickly. The brothers decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and started making boards. They have made more than 450 so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. As Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of use.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website.

There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will one day hold a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will make them rich."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that a few years ago, this was just a piece of unused land, flat and covered with wild plants. For a long time, people thought it was worthless. But with careful planning and hard work, one man, with the constant support of his wife, turned this land into the beautiful place you see today. Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. Bulldozers and digging machines helped, but a lot of hard work was also needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.

Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they needed to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims, and he made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting from when the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics to handle all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself.

You will notice that all models are made to the same scale, and even the smallest details are carefully done. This was achieved through patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high-quality work and upkeep. The techniques used here have been used in other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses.

All the model buildings show traditional British architecture and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, similar to those found in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small mistake can mean hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to see the models move.

At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models are not as good as the others. We are always updating and replacing models, so your feedback is important. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about us!"
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures cause a lot of harm to famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization created to handle such issues. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where privacy is expected, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It is shocking that the PCC did not investigate on its own. They should also look into the recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. These decisions would be reported by other newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would no longer be profitable to hide and take pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', which it could, there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to make a complaint? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC realistically monitor all British press: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. There might be a worse story they have kept from the press, and they fear it could become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might seem like an enemy. A British comedian also suffered when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"There is a lot of advice for college graduates starting their first job. This article is about moving to a second job. We are not talking about those looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those leaving a bad job in the first few weeks. We are focusing on those who are ready to take a real step in their career, choosing a job that matches their goals now that they have some experience and skills.

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. Ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to higher positions, or switch to a different field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility.

If you feel like traveling, now is a good time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again soon.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after college working for three lawyers. It was a great first job because they were supportive. She learned about office work and improved her computer skills. But there was no chance to advance, so she quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. In two and a half years, she has grown a lot in her job. Her boss wanted to help her develop from the start. Her job title is the same, but her duties have changed. She went from mostly typing and answering phones to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. She also deals with different questions, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda involves her in all her work and gives her specific projects and events to organize."
FCE_17,"Confident people: What's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but most of them have learned this skill because they needed to. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

A. Jenny: When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I did well. Someone there suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

B. Michaela: Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive and impatient. I thought that's how confident people acted, but I learned that confidence means believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel bad about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to overcome those fears.

C. Lisa: People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. In TV, looking confident is very important. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and we feel better when we talk to someone friendly. My mother once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves.' I remember this advice. You gain confidence by facing things that scare you. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I wouldn't be that scared again.

D. Barbara: My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over the years. If you keep going and learn from mistakes, you'll be more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. They also encourage setting achievable goals. It's helpful to see you're achieving something real, rather than aiming too high and getting nothing.

E. Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak up in meetings. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my opinions. When I started in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' I also wrote down notes to help me, like a comfort blanket. Everyone feels a bit nervous about public speaking. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"Paul Forster visits Malaysia for a kite-flying festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali, a local, smiles as Paul returns his broken kite. Adnan tells Paul to keep it because it's a tradition that if a kite's line breaks, the finder keeps it. Adnan has many more kites, all beautifully decorated and made of tissue paper and bamboo. They sit under the trees near the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, watching Malaysia's biggest kite festival. 

On the beach, there are 10 platforms where helpers hold up kites. Competitors wait for the signal to release their kites. When the whistle blows, the kites fly up like rockets. Over 500 men and boys compete, each with four kite designs judged on decoration, stability, and flying ability. Adnan explains that flying kites is easy, but making them requires skill. He invites Paul to his home to show him how it's done. Paul accepts the invitation and enjoys cold tea and fish crackers at Adnan's house. Adnan asks Paul to return the next day to help rebuild the kite, but Paul has other plans.

Paul explores the southern part of Kelantan, driving towards Kuala Lumpur through mountains and rainforests. He takes a wrong turn and ends up at a river. A boat is there to take people across. Paul sees a sign for 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km' and decides to follow the path. The path is steep and slippery. At the end, he meets Baba, who runs a tented kitchen and bamboo huts. Paul decides to stay the night, despite the insects. The night is dark and full of sounds, with a waterfall nearby. In the morning, he enjoys a view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rains heavily, and Paul gets soaked. He worries about his car being washed away but finds it safe, covered in mud.

Back in Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, people are friendly and ask Paul many questions. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but Paul remembers it for the kindness of its people."
FCE_48,"**What kind of shopper are you?**

Everyone goes shopping, whether they like it or not. But people shop in different ways. Do you know what kind of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people about their shopping habits.

**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**  
I'm a shopping addict—I can't spend enough money! When I have money, I go shopping, and it makes me happy. I find it hard to ignore sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple!

**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**  
I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he wants. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and don't tell my husband the real price—I always say it cost less! The real price always sounds too high.

**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**  
I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and would rather be doing something else.

**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**  
I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and try to shop quickly. I do have some mistakes hidden in my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes buys the wrong thing!

**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**  
I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and messy, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish quickly!

**F. Lisa, 22, actress**  
I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my friends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I'll buy it.

**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**  
I'm a careful shopper—I like shopping, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and don't go crazy. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much!

**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**  
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it's too busy. I'm a careful shopper. I usually know what I want and never buy things immediately. I look in other shops to find a better deal—it takes me a long time!

**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
I'm an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city center, the shops don't interest me anymore. When I have to shop, I do it quickly and don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Sometimes the clothes I buy don't fit, but I don't mind. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of time shopping!"

**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by Dutch 18th-century artist Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778 because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons to paint them. Miss Violet Churchman donated this picture in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. The exhibition also includes Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition is open until 31 May.

For a group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning how to cook seriously. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to eat the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. Then my mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.'

Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skills to make food for themselves when they leave home.'"

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' so people could trade more easily. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

PET_27,"Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses, and they are found everywhere on Earth. They are the only flowering plants that can live in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands support many kinds of animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This is why large groups of animals can live in one area. After they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh meal."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, who has always loved fashion, recently won the Young Achiever of the Year award at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis, and they sold very well. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. Kal's parents were supportive of her career change, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates clothes for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels very fortunate and says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,"SUNNINGDALE HOTEL

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has been a great place for people from all over the world to stay. In the last 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have visited. The hotel is on a main road leading to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes by bus to get to the center, and buses to many parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Be careful not to take buses with the blue sign ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is an underground station less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 comfortable, centrally-heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of all corridors. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. There is parking available in the hotel drive. Free daily newspapers are provided, and you can buy stamps at the office.

Guests staying for a long time must pay for their stay weekly in advance and give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get room priority. Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. During the week, if you are studying or working late, you can request dinner until 11 pm by writing your name on the late list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires (for cooking or heating) are allowed, and guests should respect others' comfort. If you have tapes or CDs, please keep the noise down, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If you arrive by train, it is best to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main railway station."

When Bo the cat decided to explore a furniture van, she had a bigger adventure than she expected. The driver found her after he had driven over 500 kilometers. It was the end of a long day, and both the driver and the cat were hungry! He gave her some milk and started asking around. He called his last customers, but none of them had lost a cat. It was getting late, so he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital.

Meanwhile, Bo's owner was also trying to find her. After looking everywhere, he remembered the furniture van that had delivered something to a neighbor. Luckily, he remembered the name of the company. He called their office, and soon Bo was safely returned to him."
PET_49,"The Ghan Train

Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin in northern Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm north coast through endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs. However, this line often had serious flooding, making it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. A transcontinental railway is rare, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners who were eager to board. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the Ghan waited for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip up the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have delivered everything the advertisements promised, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time climbing Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is 600 meters high and is probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard it feels like ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to get attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. 

The path soon went up, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb in the future. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and all the way to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, we were not so lucky because a mist came down. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as challenging as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to slopes that are too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns doing that job. That first time, I only felt I enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. But this new school is special because it is one of the first in our country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched it being built. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land for the school, although it meant losing some nice open space. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are much bigger than the ones in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town when they need it for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside, and it keeps the sound in too. So, when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that there is a tree on the school roof! The builders put it there because it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that you can see it from far away! We took some pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the new school building, some parts are still being added. For example, we are putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places, and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would do. Half of us spent the morning caving, while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but felt happy and excited about what we had done.'"

Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old, I was far from home, and I was very worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong, and I explained what had happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the telephone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had my handbag and offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with everything inside untouched. I would like to say how wonderful everyone was who helped me that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty. Mrs. B. James, Newport'"
PET_60,"Sharks

Sharks are some of the scariest animals in the ocean. They are very good at finding food underwater because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.

Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if you turn a shark over on its back, it can stop moving completely. This is helpful for scientists who study sharks because it lets them learn more about these interesting animals."

PET_53,"Text: 'Joining the Kirov Ballet I'm Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around and asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they started talking in English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once to talk to her because I felt a little lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. That makes me confident I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD finishes. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy. Right now, we are preparing for a new production, and there's also a competition for young dancers that I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people thought the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit opened an art show in a special igloo (a snow building) in Jukkasjarvi, a small town on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, some foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside with natural winter materials, the finishing date can change because of the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and lots of wool socks. It's a good idea to wear shoes that are bigger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

The store's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. A police officer who came to the store said: 'The police knew a big crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store filled up quickly, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly until there was room for them inside. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. What surprised me was that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store. This caused the road to be completely blocked.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

PET_34,"Tanya Streeter is a famous free-diver with four world records. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep and returning to the surface without help. She had gone deeper the year before but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive at different depths. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents, but Tanya believes safety and training are most important.

Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine stays the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land at the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking to stay fit. When she practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, with a rest day between each dive to avoid getting tired.

When not training, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products and supports environmental causes by doing research or making films. Growing up on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. She is well-known in some countries, so people listen to her about environmental issues. In her thirties, Tanya plans to keep breaking her own records.

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the movie screen. With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people in the movie industry thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors came up with some new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy together. However, not every cartoon film was a success. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again."

Caroline Benson shares her experience of acting in her first TV role. She says, ""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays before, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother always said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I dreamed of playing her. 

Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. 

The outdoor filming began a week after university started, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on my essays. I didn't tell my university friends about the filming, but they found out and thought it was amazing. It was a fantastic experience, and I feel very lucky. 

After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I don't come from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles but haven't received any offers yet. I don't know how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I didn't know what to do with my time. Since then, I've acted in two college plays.

PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than 300 types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. Honey was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who even used it as money. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that it can help prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. But honey is not just food - it can also be used for sore throats and is an ingredient in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had become one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has been a popular center for different religions, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is quite small compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. With a growing student population and success as a modern commercial center, Norwich offers a wide range of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's attractions is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the middle of their city as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth so that the roof of the Mall could become a city center park with water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are successful, showing that Norwich has managed to combine the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, about twelve hot-air balloons took off from a parking lot in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at the current location outside the city.

What to See

The pilots of the balloons stay in contact with each other by radio and light up their burners at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow' and is a great chance to take amazing photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am when the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to take off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, and some are shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take a cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere and offers a great view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

The Albuquerque Box

This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

Practical Advice

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long lines at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you are not using a digital camera, you will need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."
PET_51,"The Eden Project

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular places for tourists to visit. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many products we use every day come from plants, like wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. There are over 135,000 different types of plants grown here. Even if the weather is cold outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always damp because of a big waterfall. Another zone copies the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to build a desert zone soon."
PET_11,"Text: 'No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I don't understand why. Having 500 pages of original writing for just £6.99 is amazing! Most of the book is fiction, with parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable pieces by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the less famous writers seem to write mostly about food. Be careful with Jane Harris's Those Nails - don't read it right after eating. It has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset your stomach! There is also great work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can find parts of novels being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a bit of non-fiction, including a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers, and an extraordinary piece about herself by Ursula Owen. This is an exceptional collection, and I can't wait to see what next year's collection will have.'"
PET_14,"Text: ""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when you are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to start teaching children at three or four years old, but she sometimes makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. 

Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, once every two weeks. In addition, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents also need to attend the classes. It is important that parents show interest in the lessons. From the beginning, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists, and she often suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance tune, it's clear that the band is moving away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans, but they could easily become hit singles because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems. This issue has caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets should not worry because all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the ones that make you want to dance. However, I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as good. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."
PET_36,"San Francisco

San Francisco is on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was discovered from the land, not the sea. In 1849, thousands of people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But it wasn't the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made money by owning banks and law firms, and they built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

He also writes about himself, even about his faults - he often slept during church or looked at the pretty girls. He describes his home life - a quarrel with his wife and how they became friends again, and his worry about her illness. Besides books, he liked music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and lots of fun. Pepys was a busy man who had many important jobs - he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work for the British Navy.'"
PET_33,"The History of Shoes

In the past, people didn't care if shoes were comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins that people wrapped around their ankles when it was cold. We still use leather today, but other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on what is trendy.

It was only 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either the left or right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, even though some shoemakers still use traditional skills, most shoes are made by machines in big factories. The invention of sewing machines helped the shoe industry make a lot of cheaper shoes for more people."
PET_20,"When I hurt my back, I had to stop my running career for a while. I wanted to help more women try running, to show them how fun it can be and to help them feel confident to start running. I decided to create a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with how some race organizers acted. They often complain that not many women join races, but they also don't provide separate changing rooms for women. I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were of different ages and fitness levels. Most of them wanted to lose weight, but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined it would be hard and painful. They didn't think about running while chatting and smiling in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned from other runners about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to support women's running, and I have enjoyed watching their progress almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built and grew fast. One of these towns was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. 

During the summer, boats could bring important supplies to these towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could rest and eat, and feed their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main way to travel. However, the dogs had one last important job in 1925 when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot skilled enough for the flight, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. 

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete it. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a reliable guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to go further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made of ice. You can even get married there if you want. The bar is also made of ice, so it's not a good idea to put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are about -4°C, but guests get special sleeping bags to stay warm. If needed, the hotel can also provide warm outdoor clothes. The hotel is never older than six months because it melts in the summer and is rebuilt each winter. Building the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."
PET_29,"Maria Mutola

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" A local newspaper wrote about the story, and Jose Craveirinha, who had helped other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and found her playing football outside the club. He quickly saw that she was very fast. ""He talked to me about athletics. I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot.""

Jose visited her parents and convinced them that Maria could be successful in athletics and that it could help their family out of poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an offer to train in the United States. She had said no before because she knew she would miss her family. Her life was very different from the girls she met in the US. She says, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and especially to enjoy the view. The view is amazing, and the Skywalk makes it even better. The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform with glass walls and a glass floor, so you can see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of people have visited it. You need to wear special shoe covers to protect the glass from scratches. Walking on the Skywalk makes you feel like a bird flying high in the sky."

The Rocky Mountains stretch almost the entire length of North America. They begin in the northwest but are only a few hundred miles from the center in the more southern parts. Even though the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are just as amazing. There are many roads through the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. You start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful big cities. This city is special because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains. People living in Vancouver can go skiing just 15 minutes by car from the city center. In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day on the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still a great adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but some of the most beautiful views are at night."

In the early zoos, animals were often trained to perform tricks for visitors. This does not happen anymore because now zoos aim to show animals behaving naturally. Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with the idea of zoos. People who support zoos say they help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, which we couldn't do otherwise. On the other hand, some people are against zoos because they think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also argue that in poorly managed zoos, animals live in dirty conditions and eat the wrong food.'"
PET_59,"JAZZ By Katie Atkins, aged 14

I play the trumpet in my school's jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, while others wore bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were used to performing in competitions. The quality of playing was amazing, especially since everyone was so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played!

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join can. Only about half get accepted. However, anyone who is eager to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot.

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. I find jazz exciting because it's both new and old. You can create your own music, but you also feel part of its history, playing on stage like great jazz performers before you.

My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we wouldn't get far with our music!"

Recently, many winters have been dry, so when it rains, the local people are happy. Marrakesh's parks and gardens don't rely on rain. Instead, they get water from a network of underground channels dug in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year. Places that are usually dry but get water this way are called oases. If you travel further south from Marrakesh, you reach Skoura. Here, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, covered in snow during winter, provide a beautiful background.'"

PET_52,"Eight-eighteen News

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to big and local newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website if they are accepted by newspapers and TV or radio stations.

We have three centers around the country where young people can meet other members and join projects. We plan to open more centers across the country. Our news agency started in 1994, and we were first called 'Young News'. Since then, over 2,500 young people have been members.

Sophie, a former member, says: ""I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities the young journalists had. Age didn't matter; they were trusted to do the stories on their own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, checking articles before they go online.""

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you'll receive training and attend monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and over who train new members in basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are supported by older staff who go with them on these trips.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with all levels of reading and writing skills. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

**About the Flights**

During the short Antarctic summer, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. We use a large passenger plane, a Boeing 747. Flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, you can change your booking if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. After about four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have lived in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history and answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you the view from the cockpit on the video screens from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a window seat?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will move to the seat on your second pass. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. Over Antarctica, we encourage you to walk around the plane to share the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' so everyone can see the sights well from both sides of the plane.

**What if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the satellite cloud pictures and chooses the route with the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife is at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica to protect the environment. To see wildlife, you would need to take a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can take photos. All cameras are welcome. We also offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"Little Chefs

For a group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning how to cook seriously. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to eat the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. Then my mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.'

Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skills to make food for themselves when they leave home.'"
PET_5,"Winter Driving

Winter driving is dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly when you go over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. 

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make your car hard to control. So, when you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it.

Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid trouble."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law but decided to go to art school instead. At art school, he found traditional drawing classes hard, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. There, he became interested in early Italian artists, which influenced some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. To do this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, but he says he never knows exactly how it will turn out. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors you put next to each other.' Unlike some artists, he never makes drawings before starting a painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why he prefers models who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he hasn't felt connected to the Scottish painting scene. He says he doesn't want to follow any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we didn't like the idea because of the noise. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. ""Okay,"" we said, ""but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Because drums are hard to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our house with their guitars and other electric equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music sounds a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical skill—after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did when I was a teenager—but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain—Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives young people important experiences outside the classroom, as well as the chance to study for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from all over the world. They study in the morning. In the afternoon, they do useful activities like helping on a farm, taking care of people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is that its students come from many different countries and social backgrounds. Since not many can pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, there are grants available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they get help from the government.

""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides its students with an excellent education using methods that really seem to work."
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an older student At 32, I have just finished my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly and have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I was earning a good amount of money, but I was bored because the job didn't challenge me. I felt stuck and unhappy in my job. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy and full of hope. I wanted to be part of that. Now that I am a student, I find it hard to connect with younger classmates. They often think I am a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel different from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am happy to study because I know I need a qualification to get a good job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. There are also benefits like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I sometimes worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school at this age was a good decision.'"
PET_48,"Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he didn't like farming. At fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cheap cars that ordinary people could buy. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant fewer choices. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family to travel to Asia with other climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is tough. ""You have to carry everything on your back,"" she said, ""so you can only bring what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and I didn't even take a toothbrush. I usually like to be clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!"" When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. She suddenly became famous. Now, she has written a book about the climb, and people often ask her to talk about it. She also has a new job on a science TV show. Rebecca is well-known today and has more money, but she still lives in the small apartment in south London with her pictures and books about mountains."

KET_13,"CANADA GEESE

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to warmer places. The winters in Canada are so cold that the birds would die if they stayed there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn."" Bill had a small plane, so he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he took short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather came in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to return. They didn't come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but couldn't find them. When he got back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without his help!"
KET_16,"Esther's Story

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, but Esther used the money from her aunt to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and some glass jars to make her own jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and quickly doubled the £500 from her aunt.

At first, Esther's parents didn't want her to spend her time making jam. They thought she should study and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor one day. But Esther didn't listen to them and continued making jam. After a few months, she started selling it at the local market. Then she began making orange juice, which she sold to a school where one of her friends worked.

After two years, Esther's business grew very large, and her parents were very happy with her success. She made all kinds of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to hire some people to help her."

KET_46,"Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they don't get too hot. 

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer, and the weather was hot, so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everyone loved them because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. 

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers, so she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, all the socks are made by machines. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favorite gift. On the walls of Jenny's office, there are many letters from happy customers all over the world."

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave a door or window open by mistake. He explained that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home then. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark, and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch other houses on the street when people are not at home and to call the police if they see anything unusual. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help is free.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were always moving to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages slowly got bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and then some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes.'"

After nine months, she started working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later joined British Airways as a flight attendant. Four years later, she got her current job as a manager. Here is what she said about her job:

My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check flight times on my computer, and then I talk with some of the flight attendants. Sometimes I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are doing. That's my favorite part of the job, but I also like office work. Traveling can be tiring.

KET_62,"The Weather

People are interested in the weather for many reasons, and it is important for people in different jobs. For example, the weather is very important for farmers. Many years ago, farmers spent a lot of time looking at the sky, animals, and flowers to try to understand the weather. Now, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, many people still believe in old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will rain soon."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small town in Canada. They have always been friends and classmates. Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework. They have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin, who had trouble with reading. Kevin learns words better by seeing pictures and hearing information than by reading. Frazer wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make a computer game, and now it's ready to use. It's a game with speaking and pictures. For example, if you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their computer game, and it will soon be sold worldwide. Many schools are interested in buying it."

KET_58,"Bollywood

'Bollywood' is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It makes almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is more than the USA, making it the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians prefer watching films over any other free-time activity, and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films usually tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of every film. Indian films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they do not earn as much money. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make, while a Hollywood film is never made for less than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but usually only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years."

KET_2,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes came to England over 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer arrived more recently. The name ""Giant"" fits well because these dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs to be cut often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use them to help with sheep. They are also used by the police because Schnauzers are very intelligent. A Schnauzer is a nice family dog. It is friendly and very good with young children."

This is because he has written for French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend money on lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much harder to cook for fifty people than for your family, but he is sure he made the right choice.'"

Many young people called the radio station to ask for his songs to be played again. In Japan, John uses the stage name Jon Otis.

According to Fiona Lever, a teacher, ""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you have two feet and can walk, then you can do it!"" You don't need a partner because you dance in groups. It's a great way to make new friends. In my classes, there are both young and old people. The boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet during the dances!

KET_4,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE

Today, there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700, London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London started to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid, and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others."

Many tourists come to the Festival to see new films and plays and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, you can watch over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries.

KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake turns into ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,"" he says. ""First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet some nice people here!"""

Her uncle was a doctor who made wax figures of people. He opened a museum for these figures in Paris, and Marie helped him with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was put in prison. While in prison, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette.

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became less expensive, many people started buying them. People began riding bicycles to work and during their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles because cars are much faster and you stay dry when it rains. However, some people still prefer to cycle to work. They say there are too many cars in city centers, and it's hard to find parking!"

It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their trainers and stood in front of big white cards. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started painting on its card. Sometimes, the trainers gave them a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, following their trainers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the trainers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest ones live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Big Cats

There are many different types of cats. They come in different sizes and do not look or behave the same. Tigers are the largest cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers often lie in water when it is hot! Lions are the only cats that live in large family groups. Several lions may work together to find food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and easily follow other animals. All cats need good eyesight because they catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong."
KET_36,"Dear Mrs. Brian,

I'm sorry, but I can't attend your class anymore because I have to go back to my country. My sister is getting married next month, and I want to help her choose a dress. My parents will prepare a big meal for the guests, and there will be a lot of work in the kitchen. I'm sad to leave the English class. You are a great teacher. Please say goodbye to the other students for me. Thank you again.

Best wishes,

KET_33,"Dear Lorna,

How are you? I'm happy because I got a new job in the city center last month. I work in a Tourist Information Office, and it is very interesting. I start work every morning at 7:30, so I have to get up very early! I love this job because I meet people from many different countries. I enjoy telling them about our city. Here is a photo of me. I'm wearing my new uniform. Do you like it?

KET_20,"The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Ostriches have wings like all birds, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn while running. Ostriches can run very fast, between 65 and 90 kilometers an hour, so it is hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. Now, at 23, she has won many snowboarding competitions. We talked to her last week at a competition in Switzerland and asked why she began snowboarding. She said, ""I've always liked sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It's easy to learn, and you can become really good in just a few months.""

We asked if she practices a lot. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because they are so beautiful. But free-riding, which is snowboarding for fun without competing, is the best thing for me.""

We also asked what is important when learning to snowboard. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you fall down a lot!"""

Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to book a room at your hotel for three nights, from September 15th to 17th. I need a single room with a shower and a telephone. Could you please give me a quiet room on the ground floor?

I will be driving to the hotel. Is there a car park available? I expect to arrive at around 10:30 p.m. Could you tell me what time the restaurant closes in the evening? If possible, I would like to have a meal when I arrive.

Thank you for your assistance.

Yours faithfully,

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is thought to be the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro make it to the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it might be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can move in the water at more than 10 kilometers an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, which allows them to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very polluted, so many fish and insects died, and the otters couldn't find food. But today, there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again.'"

KET_59,"People have always built different types of buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We use museums to keep beautiful things safe. Many people work together to create a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures to show their ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof. It looks nice from every side, not just from the top. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a famous roof. This interesting building looks like a tent made of glass."

On one of these hills, there is a picture of a very large man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the village next to him is called Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think it was a very long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.'"
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to compete in the 10,000 meters and maybe the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in big races. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for that. Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She won with the fastest time of the year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he injured his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him and he can't catch up. Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. But she always takes a break from running on Sundays. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. His mother started teaching him piano when he was six. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began his first song.

Oleg Gagarin was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he started piano lessons with a teacher in his city. Oleg quickly began winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years, then returned to Russia.

Josef Heptmann's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he started playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef always loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now, but he hopes to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he started writing children's books at 60 years old. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. His ten grandchildren don't live nearby, but they also read his stories and say if they are good or bad. This way, Bill has learned what young children like to read. Bill writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His fifth book is his favorite: ""The Sheepdog"" is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are so clever; they learn very quickly."" Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles on them, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap, and the pictures on them are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed pictures of things in the news that week, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures at that time.'"
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur because they died out about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. We don't know exactly why they disappeared. Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs looked different from each other. There were more than 5000 types. Some were very small, while others were huge. The biggest dinosaurs were larger than any other land animals ever. For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because of its long back legs.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can kill a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well and, like most animals, they find food by using their noses. There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in Southeast Asia. But not all black bears are actually black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard for them to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm parts of the world, like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You often see many crocodiles together in big groups. They eat anything they catch, such as fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat large animals or people. There are more than ten different types of crocodiles. All of them have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much bigger. Crocodiles can live for a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon that could carry people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first airplane with an engine and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Airplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, airplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometers an hour, making the trip from London to New York only four hours long. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen loved going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to see the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors ate, talked to their friends, walked around during the show, and some people even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"

I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water there is very warm, and I love swimming. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home!

See you at the end of September.
