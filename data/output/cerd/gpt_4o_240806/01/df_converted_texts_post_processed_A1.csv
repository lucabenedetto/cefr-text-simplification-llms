CPE_15,C2,"'Charging families for each bag of rubbish they make seems like a good idea for the environment and money. But it might not be. In many places, people put their rubbish in bags or bins, and a special truck takes it away. This service is usually free because people pay for it with local taxes. But families that make a lot of rubbish pay the same as those that make a little. More rubbish means more trucks and workers are needed, and this costs money. If throwing away rubbish is free, people will make too much rubbish. A simple solution is to make people pay for each bag of rubbish. This way, they might throw away less and recycle more. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea does not always work well. They studied some American towns that started charging for rubbish. People had to buy stickers for their rubbish bags. Only bags with stickers were taken away. In Charlottesville, Virginia, people paid 80 cents for each bag. The number of bags went down by 37%, but people just put more rubbish in each bag. The weight of rubbish went down by only 14%. In other towns without this system, rubbish went down by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying. Recycling went up by 15%, but many people were already recycling. In another study, the economists found that higher sticker prices only reduced rubbish a little. A 10% price increase cut rubbish by just 0.3%. People would need to buy less of everything to make a big change. Other things like income and education might also affect how much rubbish people make. Richer towns throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. Charging for rubbish is not a bad idea, but it is complicated. Simple ideas can have complex results, and sometimes they do not work as expected.'"
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin talks about how work might change in the future. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. Does it make you happy? Does it help you grow? If your job makes you boring or too busy to learn new things, then money and status are not enough.
Zeldin wants to find out how work can help people feel fulfilled. Work should not just be about making money. It should help people discover new talents and meet different people. This change would not mean getting rid of unemployment. People want jobs that are interesting and make life better. Work should be like art, with happy people at the center.
Many jobs are not as good as they used to be. Doctors are stressed, accountants worry about ethics, architects can't be creative, and managers feel stuck. Companies are getting smaller, and employees do not feel connected to their work. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company's values.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He wants to find better ways to work. Many experts focus on making companies last longer and earn more money, but we also need to think about what makes us happy as people. Are we really happy at work, or are we just working because we have no other choice?
For example, hotel workers often have low pay and long hours. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep. They could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could do more than just simple tasks. They could help guests connect with the city and each other. But accountants often say hotels should focus only on making money.
Zeldin believes work is about relationships. People want to be independent and choose their jobs and colleagues. They need to talk to people from different backgrounds. Good communication is important, but real conversation is even better. It helps people understand each other and feel equal. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Spread of a Technology**
Broadcasting first meant spreading seeds by hand. It is a way to think about growth and sharing. Broadcasting is about sending out information to many people. This idea started when new technology could send words and pictures electronically. 
Television is like the telegraph and telephone, which are two-way communication tools. But, from the start, TV was made to send information from one place to many homes. This fit well with how people lived in modern societies. 
There were some different ideas about how TV could work. In the 1930s, people in Britain tried to use TV like a telephone. Magazines showed how to make TV equipment at home. But big companies set rules that stopped these small experiments. 
In the USA and other countries, people watched TV in public places in the 1930s. This was before most people had TVs at home. But companies wanted to sell TVs for home use, so TV became something people watched at home. 
As people got more money, they could buy TVs and other things for entertainment at home. This happened in many Western countries and is now happening worldwide. 
Broadcasting helped governments share important information with everyone. It also helped create a sense of community in countries. Broadcasting was seen as a way to give everyone access to information and help them take part in society. 
Today, TV and broadcasting are changing. The way we think about broadcasting might change too. It might become just a way to talk about how we used to share information in the past."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can get out of control. Modern ads make us feel like we need more to be happy. They tell us, ""If you don't have this, you are not good enough."" Try not to look at any ads next time you walk down the street. Ads are everywhereâ€”on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, shirts, and the internet. They all tell us to buy more and more.
**Caves**  
People all over the world study caves. They want to know how caves are made, how water moves in them, and what lives inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and we want to learn more about them. Many people study caves, both professionals and people who visit caves for fun. Studying caves can be hard because you need to be fit to go inside them.
**Weather Watch**  
A long time ago, people watched the weather with just their eyes. This helped start the study of weather, called meteorology. Today, we use satellites and computers to learn about the weather quickly. Weather science uses big words, but simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience helps turn computer data into weather forecasts. People can still notice things about the weather that help scientists understand it better."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
I used to think opera was mostly about theatre. But now I know that music is the most important part of opera. I come from the theatre world, where the actor and their words are the focus. In theatre, the actor and audience usually speak the same language. 
At music events, like concerts or operas, many people do not know much about music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. Watching a great musician is like watching athletes; we see they are doing something much better than we can.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They might not understand an actor's skill and often think they could do it too. They are not always impressed by long speeches, but they do ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" 
Theatre and music audiences can be the same people, but they meet the performers differently. In theatre, they are more equal. Music could learn from theatre about this relationship. Music performances are full of emotion and can be like theatre. But music events often feel formal, with strict dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists. 
Sometimes, audiences clap at the wrong time, which can interrupt the music. But many people are working to make music more welcoming. For example, Jonathan Dove's opera ""In Search of Angels"" was performed in different places, and the audience was part of the show. 
I wish music had more of the excitement and risk that theatre can have. Sometimes, using new or unusual places for music can surprise both performers and audiences. It might not be comfortable, but it can be exciting. 
I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
I think sand is amazing because it can become things like glass and concrete. But I don't like sand on the beach. It is a problem for me. Sand blows in your face, gets in your food, and hides things like keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step on a towel or get in a car, sand falls off everywhere. For days, you find sand in your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a long time. I do not like sand.
**Lock and Key**  
People want their homes to be safe and private. Long ago, people used a big piece of wood to lock doors. Now, we have electronic locks with many combinations. But people still like using a key. Some companies tried using smart cards to open doors, but people did not like them at home. They want to use a real key. So, one company made an electronic lock that also uses a metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I was worried about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because I do not understand modern art. I like some art, like furry things, neon lights, and big photos. I think art should talk to you, but it does not work for me. The new gallery helps visitors understand art better. They have labels that explain the art and what it means. This helps me understand the art more."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
When books become movies, many things are changed or removed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see new things. When I worked on a movie script, I saw that I could take out a lot of talking and details from the book, but still show the same idea. This doesn't mean the book's words were not needed. It's about how each type of story, book or movie, needs different things to help people understand. In books, we often see the same character details or words like ""he said"" to help us know who is talking. In plays, which are mostly talking, sometimes the words don't tell us much, but they help show that people are talking to each other.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are in a different world. For a short time, we forget about real life. But when the movie ends, we come back to the real world. Some people used to think movies were just for fun and not real art. They liked watching movies but didn't think they were important like other art forms.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because everything looked the same. There were three main doors, but only one took you where you wanted to go. It was confusing for new people, but the people who worked there knew their way. The workers made movies that helped people forget their problems for a while.
**Film-makers**
Many people want to make movies. There are books and classes about how to write scripts and make films. Some people, like Robert Rodriguez, made movies with little money and became famous. He made his first big movie when he was young. In the past, movie makers took more time to learn their job. They worked on small projects before making big movies. Now, people often have to work on their own to make movies."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, many council houses were on the west side of the city. They were small and not very nice, made of orange bricks or white stucco. In summer, a factory two miles away made the air smell bad, like sulphur. In the morning, you could see a paperboy holding his nose because of the smell.
I don't remember much from my early life. But I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses. I also remember faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that wasn't ours, and snow falling on a big mansion.
My mother was a small, often angry woman. I didn't understand why she was angry. She liked to be alone, even in a room full of people. She wanted everything to be proper and clean. She told me to 'behave proper,' which meant not going into neighbors' gardens and sitting quietly for a long time.
My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who liked the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn't talk much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They talked about things like bad weather and children who didn't behave.
Growing up in West Earlham was the same for everyone. Until you were five, you stayed at home. After your fifth birthday, you went to school. Some kids had a mother with a bike to take them to school. My mother let other kids take me.
I remember the summer holidays. Sometimes, I saw things outside West Earlham, like a man who told stories about the Merchant Navy and a charity event where a woman gave out lemonade. My mother didn't like the charity because she thought they just wanted money.
My mother didn't like politicians. She thought they were greedy. But she cared about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum. We looked at paintings, and she even made a joke once about a Roman soldier in a painting."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue. It was getting dark, and the air was wet and sticky. I felt like I was sneaking around. I knew this street well. My neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, lived here. There was also Han Kieffer's grocery store and the houses of my first friends. I used to play here when I was a child. I remember the little paths in the cement where rainwater flowed. I would skate or ride my scooter over them.
As I walked, I noticed the houses changed. The porches were lower, and the yards were smaller. Over time, some houses became stores, and some stores became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these places now.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has big doors and brick walls. He didn't want one big open space, so he used a large plastic sheet to make a hallway and hide his office. This way, the kitchen is in the middle, where he can cook for friends or make coffee for clients. He used light wood for the floors and mixed modern furniture with old pieces from his parents.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" was very special. It was a travel book that felt like a story. Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories more interesting. He believed that traveling could help us learn about the past.
**Swimming**
One summer, it rained a lot. I went swimming in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles on the water. I thought about swimming across Britain, following the rain to the sea. I wanted to explore and feel free. Swimming, like walking and cycling, helps us see the world in a new way. It lets us find places that are still wild and mysterious."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children become close. Many people think children cry because they feel helpless. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than seeing someone cry. In early human groups, crying might have helped people trust each other and feel connected. We can cry for other reasons too. We might cry to show we care about people who are treated unfairly. Sometimes we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially when we are with others. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
Global warming is making the Earth warmer. We know this, but we are not sure how much warmer it will get or how it will change our lives. A warmer Earth means the weather will change everywhere. This will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and live. So, changes in these resources are important.
In the last 100 years, humans have put more gases into the air. These gases make the Earth warmer. Scientists think this is not natural and is because of pollution. They use computers to try to predict what will happen with the climate. These predictions are not perfect, but they help us understand what might happen.
Scientists think the Earth's temperature will go up by 1Â°C to 3.5Â°C by the year 2100. The sea level might rise by 15-95 cm. There might be more extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts. These changes can affect where plants and animals live and how we get food and water.
Some changes might be good. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have helped grow more wheat. But many changes might be bad. Less water might be available, especially in dry areas. Glaciers and ice might melt, affecting animals and people. The Arctic ice might melt completely, which could be dangerous.
The biggest problem might be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds more water to the oceans. Many people live near the coast, so rising sea levels could cause flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could have problems. Small islands might disappear, and people might have to leave their homes. This would be very difficult for them and for the countries that help them."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong and healthy. This is the plan of millionaire Dennis Tito. He wants to send a spaceship to Mars on 5 January 2018. The spaceship will go 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars's gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. This is important because the next chance to go to Mars is in 2031. New technology is needed for this mission. If everything is ready in time, the spaceship might go. Even if it doesn't, the work will help future space missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**Aesthetics**
Art is something we see in things like buildings, books, paintings, and statues. But sometimes, we forget that art is more than just these objects. Art is about what we feel and experience when we see or use these things. 
Some art is very famous and has been admired for a long time. This can make it hard for us to see it in new ways. When art becomes ""classic,"" it can seem separate from the people and times that created it. This makes it hard to understand what the art really means.
Art should not be separate from everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our daily experiences. People who study art should help us see how art connects to our lives.
To understand art, we need to look at everyday things that make us happy, like movies, music, and comics. These are also forms of art, even if we don't always think of them that way. 
Many people think art only belongs in museums or galleries. But art is everywhere, in the things we enjoy every day. When we see art as part of our daily life, we can appreciate it more."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often think lions hunt in groups like a team. They imagine lions hiding and then jumping out to catch their food together. Lions seem to work well as a team to get their next meal. But after watching lions for many years, we see things differently. We started studying lions in 1978. We wanted to know why lions hunt together, take care of their babies, and scare other animals with loud roars. If animals work together, it should help them have more babies. But sometimes, helping others can be bad for one animal. So, why do lions work together? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. It took us a long time to learn about them. Lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now finding answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
Bedrock's third album was very important for the band. The album, called ""New Life,"" changed rock music in the country. The old style of music was serious and loud. The new style was lighter and mixed different sounds. The album had funny and clever songs. Bedrock wrote songs about things like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. The album's best songs were about deeper feelings. One song, ""So Low,"" was about the weather. Another song, ""To the Brink,"" was a serious ballad. ""New Life"" had 16 great songs with no bad ones. It was a very good album.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I loved stories about ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from the past. My mother told me a story about one Sibyl. She offered nine books to a king for a lot of money. He said no, so she burned three books and offered six for the same price. He said no again, so she burned three more. He finally bought the last three books for the full price. This story taught me a lesson about life. I was often lonely as a child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they said no. My mother told me to do something fun so other kids would want to join me. It worked, and I learned from it. Later, I wrote a travel book. I wanted to write about something I liked. I don't like traveling much, so I made a list of places I didn't want to go. I like to think about the past, so I wrote about old places.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you send your book to a publisher, it goes into a big pile. A young worker or an older person working part-time will look at it. They want to find something new and good. If they like your book, they will show it to a more important editor. The editor will decide if your book is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about if you can write more books in the future. Publishers like to meet new authors before they decide to publish their book."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising Challenges in the 1990s**
In the early 1990s, people working in advertising had a hard time. The economy was bad, and many people lost their jobs. In Britain, in 1991, the economy went down, interest rates were high, and many people stopped buying things. Over 500,000 people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. All businesses were affected, especially car and building companies.
Advertising workers felt a lot of pressure. They had to do more work with less money. Even though times were tough, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on making products that people wanted, not just what was easy to make. This made marketing more important, but also harder.
In the 1980s, advertising was very successful. But in the 1990s, it was difficult. The bad economy made companies look closely at how much they spent on advertising. They wanted to know if it was worth the money. Many companies were not sure if advertising was helping them.
Companies wanted better advertising strategies and creativity. They wanted the best people working hard for them. Advertising people had to find ways to do more with less money. This was hard because of the economy and other changes, like new laws and changing customer needs.
Some companies also started advertising in other countries, which was a new challenge. Everyone wanted to make sure their advertising worked well. But finding help or advice was not easy. Many companies kept their successful ideas secret. Books and seminars did not always provide good advice on how to make effective ads."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not common among my friends. Cooking is not an easy job. Chefs work long hours, the job is hard, and the pay is low. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and I did not enjoy the social life. Cooking seemed serious and honest, unlike my university life. I also loved the art of cooking. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started reading cookbooks and cooking fancy meals instead of focusing on my history degree.
**The Swimming Lesson**
The swimming teacher at school was a small, strong man with tattoos. He used to be a drill sergeant. I asked him to teach me how to dive. He told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this for an hour. Next time, I stood up and dived off the edge. The teacher was strict. He told me to look up, keep my legs straight, and point my toes. The next week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I was scared. I tried to remember what the teacher said and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, my dive was not good, but I felt very happy. I understood what it means to feel 'free as a bird'.
**The Traveller**
Some people love adventure. They like to climb high mountains, sail alone in the sea, and eat strange food. They live with danger and the unknown. Many people think these travelers are strange. They live in a world different from ours. We like our comfortable beds and safe lives. We think these travelers are not important. We are happy with our microwaves and phones, and the only danger we face is crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time sailing. He is not the best sailor, but he is good. He sails because he likes to write about it. His boat has a device that tells him where he is on the sea. He likes this device, but he thinks other sea tools, like the compass, have changed how people sail. Before the compass, sailors had to watch the waves and feel the sea. Now, they just follow the compass, and the sea is just a space to cross. Raban thinks this is why he can look at the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two big joys: going on holiday and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel at home in the world. We see our own experiences in stories from long ago or far away. In books, we find our thoughts and feelings. Authors write about things we feel but cannot say. They use clear words to show what we feel inside. This is amazing, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We thank these writers for helping us understand ourselves.
When we travel and read, we break away from our usual habits. Our eyes see new things in a new place, just like when we read a great book. Books help us notice things we missed before. We see the sky, people's faces, or feelings we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel stories were in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made small changes to some parts, but not much. I fixed a few mistakes. In one story about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it didn't. I didn't change the story because it was true at that time. Travel shows us the world, even if we don't know what will happen next. We learn from what we see.
**Ecotourism**
""Ecotourism"" is a popular word in travel. It started in the 1980s when people cared more about the environment. Tourists wanted to travel without harming nature. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean many things, like living with tribes or a short boat trip. It includes culture, nature, and adventure. The idea was good, but without clear rules, travelers can get confused.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my Transylvanian travel notes for 50 years. I found them again by luck. They helped me remember my trip. In Transylvania, I stayed in friendly homes for a long time. I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to say. When I moved, I wrote short notes. I worried about the order of events, but then I decided to let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is not just a new thing. It has been around for a long time. Many people think fashion started in the 1800s and 1900s, but it is older. Fashion, like style and design, has a long history. In the 1500s and 1600s, people started trading more, and fashion began to grow. As societies grew bigger and more complex, people made more types of clothes. Clothes started to have more meanings. Today, it is hard to say what clothes mean. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.
**Writer**
Many people think writers make a lot of money, but this is not true for most writers. Some writers have other jobs during the day and write at night. This way, they have money even if their book does not sell well. Other writers, like me, do many small jobs. I teach, do workshops, and write articles. I heard about a job writing for a chocolate factory, but I never got it. I write my books by doing many part-time jobs and getting help from friends.
**Sudden Fame**
Our small shows were selling out, and many fans came to see us. We had to use secret doors to get into places because of the fans. On days we did not have shows, it was hard to go outside without fans following us. In a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched us, and our managers took care of us. Even though I was shy, I started to feel more confident. But I was still not used to being famous."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music and the Future**
Technology is changing how we live and enjoy music. In Britain, people can listen to music on the radio, TV, CDs, and online. Because of this, there are fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians. Music is important for everyone. It is part of big events and personal activities. Music will always be here, but it might change. People might still want to learn instruments.
The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain. Playing music can help people in many jobs, especially in media. Learning music can also help children with skills like thinking and working with others. Playing an instrument can teach good habits like practicing and being on time.
In the future, music might change in two ways. First, people will listen to many different kinds of music. New styles will mix old ones. Second, technology will help people make music. This might mean fewer live shows, but more people will want to make music in their communities.
To prepare for the future, music teaching needs to change. More people should learn to play instruments at any age. Music teachers need to inspire and teach all ages. They should learn to work with big groups and have skills for community work. This is different from how music was taught before.
Music is important in our lives, but we often forget this. People in the music world need to work together to show how important music is."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
People sometimes make fun of actors. This happens because actors often talk about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often say things that sound silly or are just gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, said that acting is only interesting when you do it, not when you talk about it. Each play is new, and actors learn from the characters and the writer. When a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next one.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man between boyhood and manhood. His acting is simple and confident. He is very good with the text and controls his body and mind well. Lester plays Hamlet as a young man who is angry but also funny and lovable. His performance is very good. When you watch him, you see how he uses his body to show his character. Acting makes us ask questions like: What is acting? What is behavior? Who controls the actors?
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors listen and think about the words. When it's their turn, they read the line, think about it, and then speak. For example, if the line is ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" the actor breathes, imagines the scene, and then speaks. The director says not to plan too much and to trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre makes you feel like you matter. Going to the theatre is special, and the staff should feel that too. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well. The theatre should fit the human voice and body. Old theatres often do this well because they feel like they have history. You can't please everyone with a play. People want to see something new and surprising."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was very popular with young people. But it also changed the lives of older people and the middle class. It helped create new rock stars. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, listened to this exciting music on the radio. Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party, played this new music. Many young people, like John Lennon in England, loved listening to it. Paul Simon was very interested in the music and wanted to make his own songs.
**Snow Adventure**
I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I walked on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what could have happened if the hole was deeper. I sat by a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. I had walked half a mile in one hour. I knew I had to change my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books about qualitative research. These books talk a lot about collecting data but not much about how to look at the data. Many people do not know how researchers study their data. We asked different social scientists to talk about how they do it. We wanted to understand the process better, not just make a guidebook. This is not easy, so we let the scientists share their work in different ways, like telling personal stories or using more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look like a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was copying a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn't remember much. Many people like learning on the internet and computers, but is it a good way to learn? One father tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words, but the son just played with the pictures. The father thought, ""If he read a book for ten minutes, he might have learned something."" TV, like my son and his noodles show, gives ideas but not much learning. Research says learning happens best with teachers or parents talking with children. New technology can help teach, but schools are still important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's movies were made in Hollywood. People living there didn't like it at first. They thought the movie people were rude. But they accepted it because movies made a lot of money. Hollywood knows a good movie when it sees one. A good movie can make someone a star and make a lot of money. In less than 100 years, Hollywood became as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. It changed a lot. A long time ago, you could walk through orange trees to the store. Now, it is a busy place. People in Hollywood talk about movies, who is dating who, and who is working on what project. Successful people often want to leave Hollywood to live somewhere else. But many people in show-business still come to Hollywood.
**Photography**
Photography was invented in the 1800s by artists. They wanted to make pictures of what they saw. They used light, a lens, and chemicals to make pictures. These pictures were more real and detailed than paintings. Some artists didn't like photography at first. They said it wasn't real art because it used machines. But photographers knew they found a new way to make art. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils. They showed the world and people in a new way.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, all children's books had pictures. Even books for older kids had pictures. But over time, there were fewer pictures in books. Children's books were made with little money, so some pictures were not very good. But the best artists always did their best work. The old black-and-white pictures are like a mix of junk and treasure. They are fun to look at and study. Some of these treasures are coming back. Publishers might make new books with these old pictures. They might also show them in exhibitions."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. It said that when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also telling everyone, even people you don't know, that you are not at home. This made people think about the problems of sharing too much online. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. This can be exciting because we might become famous or rich. So, we start sharing our secrets, photos, and stories online. But then we realize it can be dangerous and confusing.
Don't worry, though. Some people have already explored this online world. They were the first bloggers. They learned the hard way by losing jobs and friends and dealing with being famous. They did this before social media was popular. We can learn from their stories.
In 1994, a student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. He wrote about everything and posted photos. People loved reading about his life. But one day, he had to stop because his girlfriend said, ""It's me or the blog."" He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong wrote a blog about her life and job. But someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. Heather stopped blogging for a while but later started again, writing about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger"" and earns money from her writing.
Heather learned that just because we can say anything online, it doesn't mean we should. We need to be careful about what we share."
CPE_23,C2,"'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired. In busy and rich countries, people often do not sleep enough. In the USA, 40 million people have sleep problems. Some books in Britain talk about people who cannot sleep. People are interested in sleep and why it is important. A sleep expert says, 'People need more sleep. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' 
A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep. In England, a university studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise affects sleep, and how tired drivers are dangerous. They ask students to help with their studies. Students get paid and change their sleep for the study. 
Dr. Louise Reyner works there. She says some people worry because they put things on their heads to study sleep. But they only look at physical things. In a dark room, there is a car simulator. People drive it after little or no sleep. They try not to fall asleep, but they do. A video shows a person trying to stay awake. They blink and nod off. The car goes off the road. Coffee can help. Two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. Dr. Reyner suggests coffee, energy drinks, and gum to stay awake. 
We know some things about sleep. People sleep in cycles. There are four stages of sleep. Dreams happen in light sleep. The brain stops the body from moving during dreams. Scientists think sleep helps the body and brain, but they are not sure. Women sleep more than men, and older people need less sleep. 
In the past, people slept differently. From 1500 to 1850 in Britain, people had 'first sleep' and 'morning sleep.' They woke up in the night for an hour. They used this time to think or do things. As lights became common, people started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer, so they slept less. In some places, people still sleep in short times, not all night. They wake up to watch for danger. Many people need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I had a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a real cowboy. I came from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy. But when I saw a real cowboy at the airport, I knew I was not one. He wore an old T-shirt and carried a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots and left without saying anything.
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore. I don't know what to do now. I tried to be a commentator for races, but many other drivers wanted that job too. I also tried to sell old cars, but nobody was buying them.
Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a champion. Even if I was a champion, people would only listen for a short time. I miss driving fast cars and being famous. Now, I have a lot of free time. 
In the desert, I saw some birds singing. I realized I have a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people like to walk in the city. If you walk with them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has nice weather, beautiful places with the ocean and mountains, and it is clean and safe. There are also good schools and jobs. Some people complain about new buildings, but new people and tourists have helped the city grow. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a starting point to other places. Now, it is even more of a gateway.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists like me are not good at writing letters. Some say it is because we do not get paid for letters, but I do not think that is true. In our work, we try to make a big impact, so writing a simple letter is hard for us. Real artists do not have this problem. They know how to use words well. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about using big words, but he was still a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A famous person would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open all the time, so they do not need famous people. Last week, at a new Superbuy store, people did not care who opened it. They just wanted to be first in line. The first five men got a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women got flowers. People at the front of the line were happy, and people who came late were jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
The movie ""Citizen Kane"" came out in 1941. At first, it was not very popular. People were worried because the movie was about a man like William Randolph Hearst, a powerful newspaper owner. But later, TV made the movie famous. Many people who make movies today say ""Citizen Kane"" inspired them. This is amazing because it was Orson Welles's first movie. Welles said he didn't know what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, like cameraman Gregg Toland and writer Herman J. Mankiewicz. Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a movie about a newspaper boss like Hearst. Welles was excited to direct and act in the movie.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting strange that morning. He told her he might be late and might stop at the golf club. He needed to talk to someone there. Carmel just nodded like she didn't really hear him. Dermot asked her what she would do that day. Carmel said she had nothing to do, so she would walk around town and look at shops. She thought it was nice to relax. Dermot said she should enjoy herself and not worry about making dinner if he was late. Carmel agreed.
**Job Titles**
A study showed that job titles can make people feel jealous at work. Many bosses and workers say titles can cause problems. The study found that many workers would rather have a better job title than a pay raise. People want titles that sound important, like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator."" This shows that people don't like being called less important."
CPE_55,C2,"I was in Vienna to take photos. Taking photos was my job and my passion. I loved how light looked on things and how one photo could show the feeling of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo. I had a lucky moment once when a photo I took of smoke from an oil well was wanted by newspapers everywhere. After that, I worked for myself, but things didn't go as planned. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was still happy to take photos and get paid for it.
I got the Vienna job by chance. I had taken photos in London for a book about four cities in four seasons: London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer quit, so they asked me to take his place. I was free, and they liked my work. Things at home weren't good, so I was happy to go to Vienna.
They put me in a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was busy and hot, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in cold January, it felt different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos.
The first day, I just rode the trams around the city to see everything. I wanted to make Vienna my own. A photo is a moment, and I waited for the right moment. The next morning, I went out early. The snow made the city look beautiful. I wanted to take a photo of the big cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one picture. Still, I knew it could be magical. Photography has always felt magical to me, like when you watch a photo appear on paper. Even when you know how it works, it still feels like a mystery. That's why what happened that morning didn't surprise me."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**
Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It is now a place full of wonder. This change is not because of a big, expensive show. Instead, it is because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art in the 20th century. It shows that art with movement has been important for many years. The exhibition has paintings, drawings, documents, and films. Guy Brett, who knows a lot about kinetic art, put it all together. There are not many explanations, so visitors can enjoy and discover things on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is an artist many people like. His art is easy to understand because it shows real things. People might like his art because it is about fun and escape from everyday life. Some people might like Hockney because he is funny and interesting. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. But maybe he is popular because people like him, not because his art is bad. Hockney knows he is not the best artist. He thinks only time will tell how good his art really is.
**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**
I have seen many art shows. Some are great, and some are not. Some shows try to say all the artists think the same way. I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. We called it ""Window-shopping."" Each artist made their own art. Sam Cole made knitted cats that moved on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley used a video camera until it broke. These artworks are very different, but they work well together. I did not try to make a big statement about art. Art is personal, and each artist decides what they want to do.
**Art History**
Some people love looking at paintings but do not want to study them. They think studying might ruin the fun. Some art historians focus on theory and not on enjoying art. But knowing more about art can make it more enjoyable. Our likes are not just about us; they are also about what society values. Enjoying art is important, but thinking about it can also be interesting. In the past, people thought art was different from thinking. But now, we know that enjoying and thinking about art can go together."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age found metals. They might have found a shiny yellow stone, like gold, by a river. It was not like other stones. It was soft and pretty. People liked it very much. They also found copper. Copper is good for making tools. People learned how to get copper from rocks. This was an important skill for them.
**St Ives**
We walked down a small street in St Ives. It was very windy and cold. The sea waves were big and hit the road. No one was outside. The houses were closed up tight. We came to St Ives by train. The weather was bad. I wanted to show my friend the nice coast and warm fires, but the weather was not good.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. We cannot see how people lived long ago. We can find old things, but we cannot test ideas about them. But now, we can use computers to help. Computers can make old places and people. We can see how they might have lived. We can change things, like rain or people, and see what happens."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the leader male monkey saw a new male monkey near their trees. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the leader might lose his place. The leader monkey had a smart idea to keep the new monkey away. When the new monkey tried to come closer, the leader made a loud call. This call means a leopard is near. The new monkey got scared and ran back to his trees. This happened many times. But then, the leader made a mistake. He made the leopard call while he was walking calmly. 
**What Cats Catch**
In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: are there still enough birds? The answer is yes. People feed birds in winter, and birds have places to live in gardens. Cats do catch many birds, but they are not destroying the bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make tired sounds as they go to the water. They stand at the edge, making noises about the hard day ahead. Finally, the leader buffalo goes into the water. They move slowly and look tired, but they swim to the reeds. They spend the day eating green plants in the water.
**PICASSO, Pablo**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish while he was in a fishing town. The painting shows a fish seller's table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive. The painting is flat with soft colors, like an underwater world. But there is tension. The fish and crab look like they might fight. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling. There is a sense of danger in the picture."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography
For about 150 years, photography has helped us see and remember many parts of life. It lets us see things that happen quickly and things that are very big or very small. We can see pictures from faraway places on Earth and even from space. Photography shows us the world and helps us understand life.
Long ago, people made pictures on cave walls. These pictures are very old, about 35,000 years old. We don't know why they made them. Maybe they showed hunting, helped with magic, or were just for fun. But pictures have always been important to people.
When photography was invented in the 1800s, people thought it showed the truth. The camera works like our eyes and can make a picture that looks real. This was a big change for art and culture. People thought everyone could understand photos, no matter where they were from. But we still wonder if photos mean the same thing to everyone.
Photos are very common now. We use them to show things, like when we say, ""This is my grandson,"" and show a picture. Since 1839, photography has changed a lot. Photos used to help us remember things, but now they are also part of history. They tell us about the people and times when they were taken.
Photography is not just about taking pictures. It can help change the world. Like in the past, new ways of seeing things helped change art and culture. Today, photography is a big part of our media and helps us see the world in new ways."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. There are no strict rules, but reading a lot and writing often can help. Some people need to feel happy to write, while others write when they are sad. Some write every day, and others wait for a special idea. All ways are okay if you listen to your own voice inside. This voice will grow stronger with time.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if needed. A memory can help move the story forward. Dialogue, or talking between characters, can show different sides of a story quickly. Every word in a short story is important, so make them count.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know what will happen next. But as you play more, you start to see the whole game. You learn about strategy and patterns. The more you write, the better you understand how it works.
**Looking at Writing**
Speaking is natural for humans, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons. Writing systems were created by a few old civilizations and have changed over time. Not all children learn to read and write easily. Writing is like a tool that we need to learn how to use."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a book with more worry. I call it a book because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only sometimes, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up things to fill the gaps and make the story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write what I know. To protect people who are still alive, I have changed their names and made sure no one can recognize them. The man I write about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When he dies, he might not leave any mark on the world, like a stone thrown into a river leaves no mark on the water. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong and kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was special. Then, people who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book will help people who want to write about my friend. I don't say that the conversations I wrote are exactly what was said. I didn't take notes, but I remember well, and I believe I have written them truthfully. I have made up some parts to make the story more lively, like historians do. I want people to read my book, so I have tried to make it interesting. Readers can decide for themselves what to believe. Another reason I am worried about this book is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is hard to know people from other countries. People are shaped by where they are born, the games they played, the food they ate, and the schools they went to. You can only really know them if you have lived like them. Because of this, it is hard to make them seem real in a book. I usually write about people from my own country. In short stories, you can give a quick idea of a character and let the reader imagine the rest. In this book, I don't pretend my characters see themselves as I see them. They are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**Poetry Readings**
Today, there are many different types of poetry and ways to share it. Some poets write poems to be read in books, while others like to perform their poems in front of people. This has created two groups: poets who focus on writing and poets who focus on performing.
In the last 20 years, more people have started to enjoy poetry readings. These events happen in small towns, schools, and festivals. Some poets write simple poems that are easy to understand when heard. These poets do well in performances because their poems are made for listening.
Other poets write complex poems that are best read on paper. These poets might not be understood well in a live reading because their work is more detailed and deep. They might choose to read their simpler poems to connect with the audience quickly.
Listening to poetry is fun and can help people enjoy it more. It is good to hear poets read their own work, even if they are not great speakers. It helps listeners understand the poems better. Sometimes, poetry readings include music to make them more enjoyable.
The main goal of poetry readings is to show people that poetry can be fun and for everyone, not just for a few people who study it a lot."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are using more oral stories, but this has problems. When someone tells their story, it is not always a clear picture of the past. The historian and the person telling the story can affect each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is influenced by the historian's position and how they understand history. Historians help create new evidence, but the person telling the story is also not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with things they heard from other places, like TV. They might remember the past as better than it was or feel upset about things that happened later. Feelings can make the story seem true, but they might come from later events, not the past.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: looking at how their bodies work and looking at their behavior. Physiologists study how nerves, muscles, and senses work together. People who study the whole animal look at how animals behave and what affects them. In this group, psychologists study how animals learn, often in labs with rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural behavior in wild animals. These two groups are now working more together. Physiologists think their methods are very important, but even if we know how every nerve works, we still need to study behavior. Behavior has its own patterns that we need to understand. Describing a bird building a nest by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
When students start learning social sciences, they need to do two things at once. They need to learn the content of the subject and the methods used to study it. This means understanding the information in textbooks and how this information is found and organized. Social sciences are not just common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of social life, uses different study methods, and has its own ideas. These ideas help social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and make each subject unique.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He used some Greek words for these ideas, which came from earlier Greek writings. Vitruvius did not focus on how useful buildings were, but on their beauty. Classical architecture started with simple huts in Greece and Italy. These huts were not artistic but gave important ideas for later buildings. Even if a classical temple looks fancy, it is basically a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily drove around the area, sometimes making mistakes like bumping the car. Chen found out but was amused. He said, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought Chen should be upset, but he was happy and planned a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday morning and come back by midday to not lose customers. Lily practiced driving, and Mui bought a map with a discount, which impressed Chen. 
On the trip, Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was ready to give directions, agreed. Lily overtook some slow cars, and Chen clapped. They reached the seaside and parked. Lily was careful about parking rules and paid a fee to avoid problems. She locked the van doors carefully. Chen joked that no one would want their old van, which upset the sisters. Chen then took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. He thought about Man Kee's future, wanting him to have a good education and own many restaurants.
Chen saw a ship through a telescope and told Man Kee it was special, like them. He said it would take them home one day. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily tried to see the ship, but it was gone. She only saw seagulls in the telescope."
CPE_43,C2,"Title: The Well
I read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I asked you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket and climbed in. I told you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough. You held the handle, but when I moved the bucket, I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights. Later, I realized they looked like stars in cartoons when someone gets hit.
At first, I was confused, then scared, then angry at you for letting me fall. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back, but you called again, sounding scared, and I stayed quiet. You ran to get help. I climbed out of the well and hid. I heard voices from the castle. I saw water drops on the ground from my wet clothes. I was scared they would find me.
Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was screaming, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. I hid in the shadows, feeling excited but also worried. I saw the water drops shining in the sun and couldn't believe no one noticed them. I knew I had to do something. I came out of hiding, pretending to be hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out.
Father asked me to repeat my story. I added that the tunnel collapsed, so no one could check it. Father didn't believe me. He looked at me like he was seeing me for the first time. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me sadly, knowing I was lying. His look made me feel bad, like my father's words. I realized they both saw through my lie, and it made me think about how lying was wrong."
CPE_51,C2,"**Moving Day**
Susan is a widow. Her children are grown up. She has to leave her family home. A van is outside. It says ""Removers of Distinction."" Fred is the removal man. He is packing everything in boxes. His fingers are big but gentle. His helpers are not so gentle.
Susan's house is lovely. It has four floors and looks at a small harbour. She remembers her children growing up there. Robert, her son, is helping. He is now an adult. He remembers asking, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is careful with the piano.
Fred says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred says, ""Yes, they cry when everything is in the van. But they are fine at the new place.""
Susan remembers when they moved in. The piano got stuck on the stairs. Her husband, Peter, fixed the problem. They used a crane to bring the piano through a window. It was expensive, so they couldn't tune the piano for months.
Now, Susan is moving out. She is sad but also happy. The piano is the last thing to move. Fred and his team carry it out. Susan, Robert, and Francesca laugh with relief. They walk down the path together, arm in arm, laughing. The only tears Susan has are tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**
Writing about books online: is it just for fun? When the Internet started, anyone could share their ideas. You could write about anything or start a music channel. But you needed some computer skills back then. 
One area that became open to everyone was book reviews. On Amazon.com, a big online bookshop, anyone could write what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a great idea because people could see what other readers thought, not just what the publisher or professional critics said.
Amazon was the biggest online bookshop, so it had the most reviews. But this also meant some people tried to cheat. Many reviews were posted every day, so Amazon couldn't check them all. They had rules: no bad words, no spoilers, and no personal attacks. But people could still be sneaky. 
For example, some writers wrote fake good reviews for their own books. One writer, Lev Grossman, did this because he got bad reviews. He wrote nice things about his book until he got caught. 
Authors could also comment on their books. Most just said they hoped people would like their book. Some even shared their email to talk to readers. But Amazon didn't always check if the comments were really from the author, except for famous writers.
Sometimes, readers got very upset. When James McElroy's book about cheerleaders came out, some people in the book were angry and wrote bad reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days.
Amazon liked that people spent time writing reviews because it helped their business. They watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were usually on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" got funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a computer term.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious and helped people decide if a book was good. The writer George Orwell once said that writing too many reviews was hard because you had to pretend to have feelings about books you didn't care about. So, letting everyone write reviews was a good idea."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last 200 years, people think artists must be different from others. We like art that is new and surprising. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But today, we sometimes say an artist's work is not art. The media often say this, and we agree. We want artists to be special and different. In the past, people asked artists to make art for them. Now, artists work alone, and we get upset if they try to be like everyone else.
**Picture This**
Let me tell you a story and ask a question. An artist picks some words from a book about art. The words say there are many kinds of pictures. The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the words on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th
Artists often stick to one style to be successful. People like to see the same kind of art from an artist. But some artists try new things. Picasso and Hockney did this. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He used to paint still lifes. Now, he paints the London Underground. He likes trains and started drawing them in the 1980s. His new show has 40 paintings and drawings of the Underground.
**Extract from a Novel**
I went to an island with some books. People say only a sick person would go to such a quiet place. I am here to feel better. A woman from the village comes to clean the house. I am alone. I am not happy or sad. I think about the past. Art is not always useful, but it can make us feel better. Artists can change reality with their work. Art helps us understand life better. It is not to escape life, but to see its true meaning. Why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"Title: Family Talk
My dad said, ""This is not good!"" We were driving back to London. My dad and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school. I had won two prizes at school: one for Latin and one for doing well in exams. My dad talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What is not good?"" I asked, but I knew what he was thinking. My dad usually talked a lot, but he was quiet now. ""You will do what you want,"" he said. ""You have many certificates. They say you can get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said. ""Isn't that good?""
""I hear you want to be a barrister,"" he said. A barrister is a lawyer. My dad knew a lot about lawyers. ""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I didn't know what else to say!""
""They say you are good at talking and understanding things quickly,"" he continued. ""You like performing.""
""I don't know,"" I said. ""I just watch TV shows about it.""
""Anyway,"" he said, ""I think you won't want to work in our family business. You will go to Oxford, and then you won't want to join us.""
I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to try different jobs, but I didn't want to upset my dad. I was his favorite, but he was still a strong person.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""You won't want to join us,"" my dad said. ""You have the brains and the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business.
""You can help us during holidays until you finish at Oxford,"" my dad said. ""It will give you some money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to not make a decision now. My dad would get upset if I said no.
So, I helped during holidays, never more than twice a year. I became a smart student with nice things. In my last term, my dad visited me. He said he needed me for one last job. It was important for our family business.
""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on them.""
My dad didn't understand. He thought I was leaving him when he needed me. I saw how focused and smart he was. He was like a genius. I respected him.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake after living there for a year with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois got a raise at her advertising job, making thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space and a garden. They could have found a bigger place in a cheaper area, but Lois wanted a better address for their social status.
Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as his. They needed both their salaries to maintain their lifestyle.
Now, their life could be ruined by Venetia, who was very angry with Simon. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, bribed the jury four years ago and did nothing about it. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancÃ©e before the trial. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty and scared. He wished he had been prepared for her accusations. He knew he should have said Cartwright was lying, but he panicked and lied instead. Venetia didn't believe him, and he worried she could ruin his career."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose to live here because I thought people wouldn't notice me. I hoped they wouldn't care about broken houses or messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops started to recognize me. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. I usually stay inside, but tonight I am watching birds fly. I cleared some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are scratched. It's a small London garden where plants grow tall. 
My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She writes books that aren't published, and I sometimes talk about them because I teach English. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask about your work so much,' she says. 'I'll bring a drink down,' she adds. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz knocks on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in a chair. 'Cheers,' she says. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' 
'So, what plans for the holidays?' she asks. I feel worried about the empty days. I think about walking to the shops and sitting alone in the park. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask. 'Of course,' Jaz says. 'If I'm around,' she adds, knowing she will be. 'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun,' I say. It's not true, but I often deal with stories. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks. I haven't read much of her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans. I like the title and tell her. 
'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks. 'Try writing about nice people, people who want to be good,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz says, upset. 'I keep a journal and write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,' Jaz replies. I have a life. I work, go out, and read on the train. When we go inside, I remember my old teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who would wink and say, 'I've had my moments.' We laughed a lot."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is about feeling connected to the past. We often know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about our past helps us understand our future. Heritage is like a bridge from the past to the future. It is part of our history and culture, passed down from many generations. Even if there are parts of our heritage we don't like, it is still ours. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It includes customs and things we use. In the past, we learned about heritage through stories from our ancestors. Now, we also learn from old buildings and places. It is important to keep these places safe to remember our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I wrote a book called ""Waterland"" about a place in England called the Fens. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, but I found out they are not. The Fens are a special part of England, both wild and full of life. They are mysterious and different from other places. I did not visit many places in the Fens, but I imagined them in my book. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a feeling.
**Museums**
Museums show us real things from the past. Before, museums just put things in cases with long labels. Now, they try to make displays fun and interesting. Museums should be for everyone. They can lend objects to schools and help people with memory problems. Museums have real items that were used in history. This makes them different from theme parks or books. Museums that make their displays exciting will help people want to see the real things.
**Architecture and Environment**
People have always wanted to keep things from the past. Today, towns change quickly, and this affects us. Some people want to keep everything the same, while others think about how towns should be in the future. People who lived through big events, like wars, may want to keep things stable. If people need to keep things the same, planners should think about it. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in towns show changes in our lives and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**  
If you ask someone to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used in ads for smart things like computers and books. Many people don't know much about what Einstein did, but they know he made theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand. Einstein helped change how we think about science. He looked at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before Einstein, people believed in Isaac Newton's idea that space and time were the same everywhere. Einstein said that time and space are not the same for everyone.
**Young Readers**  
When we were kids, Lydia and I did not like books that won prizes because we thought they were boring. Our mom did not like this, but our dad would give us money to read these books. He also gave us some good books as gifts, saying they were not just for fun. We thought most of these books were for boys, but we did read some short stories and poems.
**Language**  
In 1851, Jacob Grimm said that the start of human language is a big mystery. Many people have strange ideas about how language began. In 1928, Charles Caller said early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. Some people thought these sounds became words like ""malaria"" for ""fever"" or ""mors"" for ""death"". Because of these odd ideas, many people did not talk about how language started. But now, it is an important topic for research. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. People used it to talk to each other and for power. Sharing information was not the main reason for language at first."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Reviews are short and often forgotten quickly. They have deadlines and must be short. When published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they are in. People often think writing reviews is not important work. Some writers do it for extra money or because they can't work on big projects all the time. But writing reviews is a skill. It is different to write a short review for a newspaper and a long one for a journal. Reviewers must think about who will read their review. They need to know a lot about many things and write clearly. Many reviewers also write other things, like books. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews when he is not writing novels. He collects his reviews in books. Some people think reviews should not last, but others like to keep them. Kermode, who is a professor, writes reviews and books. In English-speaking countries, it is normal for professors to write reviews. This is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It is also good for professors because it helps them communicate clearly. Writing reviews is a secondary job. You can do it well if you also do other work well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. It was dark and quiet inside. Even after three years, he sometimes felt unsure about owning it. When he first bought the apartment, he was excited to come home. He wondered what the apartment was like when he was not there. It felt like a safe place for him. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment was always waiting for him. Sometimes it was tidy, and sometimes it was messy.
Ralph started to see the apartment as part of himself. It was a place where he could relax. Sometimes there were letters by the door or messages on the answering machine. He was glad nothing bad happened to his apartment while he was away. From his boring office, Ralph looked forward to being home alone a few nights a week. After work, he felt like himself again on the bus ride home. At work, he wanted to be alone, but when he got home, he felt empty.
Ralph often read books or listened to music at night. He wondered why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and thought he could have done something different with his life. After university, he wanted to make a plan for his future, but he just wanted to get by. He applied for jobs his friends talked about and followed their paths. He went to one job interview for a local newspaper. He was happy to have a nice talk with Neil, his boss. Neil gave him the job because he was the only graduate who applied. Ralph thought this was a compliment."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving to the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. A place was marked for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides to watch. Some people tried to keep the goats in order. It was hard because goats like to eat everything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I was scared about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in. We did not see any villages or huts since morning. In the moonlight, we used a torch to see the cliffs. The torch batteries were low, so we put in new ones, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley saw a light, and we were happy. But it was just moonlight on the water. We heard loud water, but we could not see it. Time felt slow, and we kept moving.
**How to be Good at Presentations**
I am not good at making presentations. But as a managing director, I need to present to my colleagues and shareholders. How can I get better and feel more confident? You are not alone. Presenting is different from running a company. Many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince others, you must believe in what you say. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework. Test your ideas before. Ask colleagues about hard questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and slowly reach your conclusion."
CPE_64,C2,"Some things take time and cannot be rushed. If you hurry, you might make mistakes. For example, if you add oil too fast when making mayonnaise, it will not turn out right. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot gets worse. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things we can do quickly, like solving puzzles. But other things need more time, like thinking deeply or solving big problems.
There are three speeds of thinking. The first is very fast, like when you react quickly to something. For example, if you are about to fall, your body moves fast to keep you safe. This is called using your 'wits'. 
The second speed is slower and involves thinking things through. This is when you solve problems or make decisions. We call this 'intellect'. People who are good at this are often called 'clever'.
The third speed is the slowest. It is when you think in a relaxed way, like when you are daydreaming or just sitting quietly. This is important for creativity and wisdom. Sometimes, thinking slowly helps us understand complex problems better.
Scientists are learning more about this slow thinking. It can help us see patterns and solve difficult problems. It is important to give our minds time to think slowly, just like we need time to rest."
CPE_29,C2,-9
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. 30 years ago, there were not many charts or books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good. Now, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Computers help make charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. But, some things are not as good. You might need to travel far to see a clear sky. Airplanes make trails in the sky that can turn into clouds. This makes it hard to watch the sky during the day and night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are many things to do and buy. New products come out very fast. This can make people feel tired and stressed. More choices mean more stress and less time. People now look for simple things that make life better. But, it is hard to make life simple because there are too many products. There are many types of soap and cereal, and many phone plans. It is hard to keep track of everything.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we stay for two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother. We do not let anything change this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are old-fashioned and polite. I do not like rude shop assistants or waiters who act too friendly. I know many guests at the hotel because they have been coming here since they were children. We greet each other politely but do not talk much. It is nice to have privacy and respect, which is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
A special show of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" moved from Stratford to London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show started last spring. I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and I was wrong about his acting. I still think Othello should be older than Desdemona, but Ray Fearon's acting is great. The whole cast is great. There are memorable scenes, like when Cassio plays games with other officers and things get out of control, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very moving. The show is exciting and full of tension. Don't miss it.
**Lake Vostok**
In the middle of Antarctica, it is very quiet. There are many penguins, seals, and birds at the edges of the continent. But in the center, there is no life. Except for a big hidden lake called Lake Vostok, under almost 4 kilometers of ice. It is the coldest place on earth. The water has been without air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are excited to explore the lake and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, scientists from around the world have been planning to discover the lake's secrets. In the next few years, we will learn more about Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was something interesting on the radio last week. Some scientists are talking about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn about everything, like atoms and black holes. They wonder why science can't explain why we want to know things. It is important to know if what scientists do is right, instead of just talking about why we do it. Science is a tool, and we should decide how to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Food is important and makes us happy. Many people like cooking. You don't need a special day or a fancy dish to cook. You can make a tasty soup with carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is better than buying soup in a packet or can. Instead of buying chocolate mousse with many chemicals, you can make a delicious one in five minutes. Cooking shows care and love. We often eat together at parties like birthdays and weddings. We don't eat takeaway food for these special days.
**In the Elevator**
Alistair tried to clean his office, but papers were everywhere. He had many tax forms and papers for his apartment building. Books and journals were not on the shelves. He knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She liked things to be neat and on time. Alistair wondered what she would think of the mess. Mrs. Wilson, the cleaning lady, came while he was cleaning. She did not want to clean his office. She only cleaned his apartment.
**Karen**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. When she was twelve, her brother hit her eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the doctor said she was okay. She had a few stitches. Her mother talked about miracles. Karen felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty walked across the grass, feeling both happy and sad. She learned something new in her small village. She was sad because Dr. Bailey, her doctor, was not well. He helped her with her throat problems every year. Dr. Bailey was kind and listened to his patients. The village loved him for this."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She also writes books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is very good at playing the piano. She plays many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it for him. 
Joanna cares about how children learn the piano. She wrote a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" for beginners. Even though she is very busy, she made time to write this book. She believes the first lessons are very important. Joanna wants music to be for everyone, not just for very talented children.
When Joanna was young, many children came to her house to learn piano from her mother. She saw children from different backgrounds wanting to play all kinds of music. Joanna thinks everyone should try to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.
Some children learn piano quickly, but others take more time. Joanna is interested in helping all children enjoy music. She worries that some parents push their children too hard to be like kids on TV. She wants children to enjoy music, not feel pressure.
Joanna's books are colorful and fun. They have stories and CDs with music to help children learn. She thinks learning should be fun. Children should try different things on the piano, like playing high and low notes.
As children learn more, they need to practice reading music. Joanna knows practice is important. She practices a lot now, but she didn't always. She says practice is the most important part of her music life. She suggests setting goals for practice and mixing easy and hard pieces."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that writing without effort is not enjoyable to read. Good writing is hard work. When I look at my old school essays, I see few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. Writing by hand was hard, so I wrote carefully. Computers make writing easy, but also sloppy. Many writers spend a lot of time fixing their computer drafts. Emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. But emails have brought back love letters. Many people now write love emails. But words on a screen can feel boring. People who write on computers often exaggerate. Printed words written quickly lack the care of handwriting.
**The CD**
I looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the disc was shiny. Mr. Warriston said CDs are amazing because they hold a lot of music. He showed me how to play it. He said some people think CDs sound too clean, but he likes them. I asked if you need to turn them over like records. He said no, you only play one side. He didn't know why both sides aren't used. He thought it was a good question. He wanted me to sit in the best place to hear the music. I was happy to ask a question he couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said if matches came after lighters, we would think they are better. People say electronic text is a big change like printing. But changes take time. In 1979, a book said books would disappear in the 1980s. That was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not fun, so people don't do it. Computers make people read small parts of text. Some say this is a new way to tell stories. But many books are not read from start to finish, like religious texts and dictionaries. Computers don't encourage reading everything.
**The Office**
Charles walked into a tidy office. The carpet was clean, and the desk was neat. Kathleen was organizing files. She told Charles to use computers because there was too much paper. Charles admired the room and did not think about computers. He and Kathleen often talked about this. She didn't understand why he didn't like technology, even though he was good with computers. He wrote an important paper about computers because of her. She was very good with software and could make it do anything she wanted."
CPE_32,C2,"Lancelot's secretary shouted, ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" She knew he didn't because she had made him coffee many times. Lancelot was at the office more often now. He used to meet authors and playwrights for lunch, but now he was always busy and had trouble finding a parking spot. 
His secretary gave him a folder from a man in Los Angeles. It was about a book called ""A World History of the Short"" by Ian Cuthbert. Lancelot didn't want to see another summary of the book. Ian had been paid a lot of money to write it, but he hadn't finished it yet. 
Ian was once a very talented writer, but he was difficult to work with. He had been given many chances to write for magazines, but he never finished anything. Lancelot thought that asking Ian to write the book might have been a mistake."
CPE_65,C2,"'Breakfast in England
Breakfast is very important for health, say experts. But in the past, breakfast was not common in England. In medieval times, people did not often eat breakfast. Sometimes, travelers ate early before long trips, and sick people ate breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the 1500s, breakfast became more common. Some people think this is because there was more food. But there were also big changes in society. People started working for set hours, often starting very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for rich people.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, ideas, and the culture around them. In this book, we will learn how these things change the style and meaning of a photo. We will also see how people look at and feel about photos. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they see photos. But we can ask if the photo shows the real scene or the photographer's view. Is the moment in the photo important, or does it show something bigger about the world?
**More than a game**
For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves a lot. You need to focus if you want to be the best. You have to work hard and not give up. Sport is tough, and you have to do it yourself. Sport teaches you to work hard and be strong, but it also shows you how to work with others. My sport lets you be good alone, but it is also a team game. Like in life, you can do well alone, but you must remember other people too. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has shown me new things and places. But you also have to give up some things for these good things.
**Tuning in**
Some memories stay very clear in our minds. For me, one special memory is from a night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a bird singing in a tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song was so beautiful that I stayed awake. The bird's music reminded me of jazz and Indian music. It felt like the bird was making up the music as it sang. I listened and enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always talked about birds. Birds are important to us. Paul Evans writes about this. A small brown bird is hitting the glass of a greenhouse. It is a wren. Some people think wrens bring messages or signs. Maybe it is just a bird stuck in the greenhouse. Both ideas can be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people watched wrens to know if they would have good or bad luck. Today, we see wrens in pictures and decorations in many homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, people still like wrens. A forest without wrens feels empty. 
People have stories about many birds. These stories are old and show how people lived with nature. Sometimes, the way people see birds changes. For example, red kites were once common in London. They took food from people and were protected. Later, people thought they were pests, and they disappeared from many places. Now, red kites are protected again and are important for nature in Britain.
Our connection with birds is very old. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also made them think about dreams. Birds are important to us because they can fly, sing, and seem free. We like these things and they help us understand ourselves. Some people think these feelings are not important now, but they are still part of us. Birds show us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because we lose not only birds but also culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are in poems and stories. Losing them is losing part of our culture.
Stories and legends about birds are important. They help us feel connected to birds. These stories are more powerful than scientific words. They make us feel and think about birds in a special way. Watching birds on TV or in our gardens is exciting. We cannot explain this excitement with science. Birds are interesting and make us wonder. The wren in the greenhouse is like a puzzle. It connects the past, present, and future with its song."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
A map shows where things are on Earth. It uses distance and direction to do this. Long ago, people used time to talk about distance, like ""a day's walk"" or ""a day's boat trip."" This told more about how easy or hard it was to travel than the real distance. 
Direction is also important, but for most people, knowing ""Where do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" was more important than exact direction. Because of this, people used written directions instead of maps for a long time. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions.
Early maps used signs to show important places. These signs could be big or small to show how important the place was. Different maps used different signs, so it is important to know what each map's signs mean.
Making maps has become more accurate over time. People used science to help make better maps. For example, they used a compass to find direction. They also learned that the Earth is not a perfect circle, which helped make better maps.
Maps are used by many people now, like soldiers, historians, and geographers. They need maps for different reasons. Today, maps show many things, like weather, land use, and more. This has made map-making very important.
Map-making has not always improved quickly. Sometimes, old ideas stayed for a long time. Map makers needed better tools to make better maps. Sometimes, people just copied old maps because it was easier.
Maps are important because they show us how people thought in the past. Studying old maps is interesting and teaches us a lot."
CPE_35,C2,"'TIM RICE I went into a young man's nice room. The rest of the house was messy, but his room was very nice. It was like moving from a cheap seat to a fancy one on a plane. He had many records, a stereo player, and nice things like wine glasses and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He got a scholarship to study history at Oxford, but he had nine months free before starting. He wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for women, money, and fame. Andrew's dreams were very serious to him. When he asked me to write lyrics with him, I said yes. He played me some of his music, and it was very good. He needed someone to write words for his music. I didn't have much to show him, but I had written a song that was recorded by a pop group. We decided to meet again and write something together. I thought Andrew was very talented and determined. I didn't want to miss the chance to work with him. Even if we didn't become famous in musical theatre, we could try to make pop music together. The next day, I was back at my job training to be a lawyer. I still looked for bands needing a singer and wrote simple songs. I thought I would probably become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. But I wanted to see Andrew again. It would be fun to write musical lyrics with him. Andrew was interesting and liked good food and old buildings. He also liked a football team called Leyton Orient. He had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who helped orphans. I wasn't very excited about the idea, but Andrew's music was good. He believed in his music, and it made me excited too. I didn't know much about musicals, but I wanted to try. I started writing lyrics for his songs. I even skipped work to write. I didn't know it then, but I was changing my career.'"
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**  
Humans have a special skill. We can use language to talk to each other. Language is very important in our lives. If you see two or more people together, they will probably talk. Even when alone, people talk to themselves, their pets, or even plants. I think language is like an 'instinct'. This means people know how to talk naturally, like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders did not learn to make webs from school or special training.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather are made by the air around us. They are very important for animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places have many plants and animals, like in a jungle. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day and makes the climate. Air moves because the earth spins and because of the sun. The sun is a big reason why air moves.
**Coffee**  
I worked in a restaurant and had to serve drinks. I also had to make coffee, which was hard. In Melbourne, a restaurant needs good coffee to be popular. I learned a lot about making coffee and using the espresso machine. Making a good cappuccino is not easy. After one week, I thought I would only clean tables. But my boss was kind. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science. You need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does TV often not do well with shows about art? Painting and sculpture are good for the camera. The camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in to see details. But, there are not many TV shows that show the joy and complexity of art. An example is Robert Hughes's show about American art, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British viewers American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the show would focus on great art pieces. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are seen in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer. I became known for taking risks. Metals are not as controlled as other markets. With luck, risk-taking, and market knowledge, you can make a lot of money. Risk is a big part of this business. This fits well with a free-market economy. But now, free-trade economists see that the market does not keep metal prices high. More minerals are being taken out, and raw material costs are going down. Adjusted for inflation, metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. I was recently asked to check claims against a big company that benefits from cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. They go from Florida to Cuba. Each island is unique and has something special. To get around Abaco, you need a boat. If your room does not include a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat. Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World.' The calm waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and beaches stretch for 200 miles. At night, the lights of restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Title: Make Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
At the Bamboo Bike Club in London, you can build your own bike. Engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan run the club. They help you make a custom bike frame over a fun weekend.
The workshop is in Hackney Wick, east London. It is the only place in the UK where you can build a bamboo bike. Bamboo is a new and exciting material for bikes. It has been used since 1894. But buying a bamboo bike can be expensive. James and Ian wanted to make it cheaper for everyone.
They spent years working on their idea in Wales. They wanted to sell bamboo bike frames. But then they decided to teach people how to make their own bikes instead. Now, they run the Bamboo Bike Club as a hobby. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.
The course is affordable. You get a custom bike frame and a fun weekend of building. On the first day, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You glue the bamboo tubes together. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks.
James and Ian help you with every step. They make sure everything is done right. If you make a mistake, you can try again. Bamboo is easy to work with, and you can choose how your bike looks.
On the second day, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them. This makes the bike strong. You also add a waterproof coating. Then, you can add wheels, brakes, gears, and a seat.
The bamboo bike is strong and lasts a long time. Ian rides his bike to work every day, and James has tested his bike off-road. The bikes are very strong.
Bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They have a unique style. They are great for a relaxed ride. The bikes are light and smooth to ride. The cost is less than Â£500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps men and women talk to each other better. Many people in America want to improve their lives, and self-help books like this are very popular. These books are important for New York publishers. In Britain, many self-help books are also sold. Some books are not very good, but many are rejected because they are too similar to others. Editors look for books that can sell well. They ask questions like, ""Is the author easy to promote?"" and ""Is the idea interesting to many people?"" A good title is very important.
**Autobiographies**
An autobiography is a book about a person's life, written by that person. The writer and the reader should trust each other. The writer should tell the truth, but sometimes they don't. There are many reasons for this. Some things are too embarrassing to share. Some things might seem unimportant. Sometimes, writers make up stories to show the truth better. Some writers call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. Readers might think they read a true story, but it is fiction.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories became popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These stories show the problems in society. A crime in the story shows human desires like greed. Solving the crime helps society work well again. In Hammett's stories, society is not perfect. The detective and the criminal are similar. They understand each other. The detective is not completely good or bad. He is both a criminal and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels guilty, and sometimes he is very eager to catch the criminal.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at a hotel to talk about writing. We both felt out of place there. Gould said that to write well, you need to understand the culture. Science is like its own world. Only scientists can explain it well. If you don't know the rules, it is hard to write about it. Gould believes you should not talk down to readers. You can use simple words, but you should not change the meaning. If readers feel you are treating them like children, they will not like your writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in London, it feels very cold because of the air-conditioning. The gym uses a lot of air-conditioning to stay cool during the hot summer. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. Many places use too much air-conditioning. Instead, they could use other ways to stay cool, like using natural light and air, or having thick walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun. People are interested in them again as we start a new millennium. A long time ago, sundials were important for keeping time. But when clocks and watches got better, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people like them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, says they are special because they connect us to the planets. When a sundial starts working, it feels magical. They are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I once saw older women painting china cups with flowers. They were very good at it, and their hands were steady. I thought only very talented people could do this. But when I went to a china-painting class, it was different. The people there just wanted to have fun. Even the teacher did not want to paint quickly like a machine. Everyone was there to enjoy painting, not to be perfect."
CPE_47,C2,"Title: The Wrong Country
Uncle found a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price. They would fly from Gatwick Airport and stay twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they booked the trip, the travel agent said they would be with a school group learning Italian.
But something went wrong. Instead of Venice, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland at the Edelweiss Hotel, Room 212. At Gatwick, a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane.
When they arrived, a woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on."" But the coach stopped at the hotel, and they were given rooms. They were tired and did not ask questions. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist said they could enjoy the lake and take a boat to Interlaken.
Keith told the receptionist there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said they were booked for twelve nights in Switzerland. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping to fix the mistake.
Mrs. Franks, a woman they saw at Gatwick, explained that many holidays have similar tickets. She laughed and said they couldn't end up in a wildlife park by mistake. Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland.
Mrs. Franks left, and Keith thought about what happened. An old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, said they slept well because of the fresh air. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They realized their holiday was with elderly people, not what they planned. Uncle had said they needed a break from the elderly, but now they were on a tour with them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American business leaders are learning from the explorer Ernest Shackleton. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. In America, people are just starting to learn about him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton 'an Antarctic explorer whose achievements were mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century.' But now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being written, and a big exhibition is being prepared at the American Museum of Natural History. Columbia Tristar is also making a movie about Shackleton's life. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with admiration and learn lessons in leadership from him. Shackleton, with his warm sleeping bag and stove, is now a model for modern managers. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has used Shackleton as a role model for years. His company helps with communication during business problems. For example, if a company's factory has an accident or if many workers lose their jobs. MacGregor says Shackleton is a good example because he was a strong leader and communicator. Shackleton made a brave decision to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole in 1908. This decision showed he cared about his men's lives. In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. Shackleton was always ready to take responsibility. His 1914 expedition became famous. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and then crushed. Shackleton told his men they would be safe if they trusted him and did their best. Shackleton planned carefully, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and ready to start again if needed. Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor says it's important to wait and not rush to fix things. If a plan isn't working, don't be afraid to change it. Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he gave his gloves to a photographer who didn't have any. He also shared a biscuit when they were starving. Caroline Alexander, author of a book about the Endurance, says people today admire Shackleton's bravery and leadership. He represents the ideals we miss today.'"
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar In the forests of Madagascar, there is an animal called the aye-aye. It lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insects inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its teeth to make holes and its long, thin finger to get the insects. Scientists have learned how the aye-aye finds insects in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson studied some aye-ayes at Duke University. He tested if they find insects by looking for signs on the wood. He gave them logs with holes. Some holes had insects, and some did not. The aye-ayes went to the holes with insects without needing to see signs. They did not use smell or sound to find the insects. They could find insects even if they were dead and quiet. Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes tap the wood with their finger and listen with their big ears. They can hear if there is a space inside the wood. The aye-aye might be like a woodpecker in Madagascar, but there are also birds that look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is special because it is like a woodpecker, a bat, and a squirrel. Its teeth grow like a squirrel's, and it can open nuts with its finger.'"
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like when they were young? We might hear stories from family, but they are often not complete. What will our grandchildren know about us? We think about writing things down but often don't do it. We might leave videos, but they are still just pictures. Hannah Renier has an idea: she writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. These books are about normal people, not famous ones. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family and saw that many stories from the past were being lost. ""At first, I didn't take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people with interesting lives. They do it for their children or the future, but they also enjoy it."" People feel safe to be honest with her. A 62-year-old man shared his life story, including hard times like his divorce. He did it for his family, hoping they could learn something. But he hasn't let his children read it yet. He wants them to read it after he is gone. He also saw patterns from his childhood that made him repeat mistakes. Hannah noticed this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things parents said or did affect them for life. They might marry someone their parents liked or do the opposite to rebel."" ""Many people still feel sad about things with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed."" Hannah listens and writes their stories. ""It's not for everyone to read, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should be in.' I include it, but they can take it out later. People want to be honest."" ""It's not about showing off. It's about remembering the past. We need to feel connected to our family history because families don't stay together as much now. People want to feel remembered."" Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these to write the story, changing the order and explaining things. Modern tools help her make the book, except for the cover. You can choose the color and title. The book is for a private audience and is not about gossip. Hannah organizes the story well, and the book looks nice. It costs about Â£3,000, with extra copies at Â£25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost stops many people. ""I thought it would be cheaper,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often wealthy, like readers of certain magazines. They are the kind of people who used to have their portraits painted for their family.""'"

I am lucky because my children and I like the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. We are close, and now that they are older, I am more like a friend to them. I do not believe in hitting. I have slapped my children in anger, but I do not think it is right. I try to be there for them if they need me.

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing ideas in weightlessness. 
The plane looked normal from the outside. It was a Boeing KC-135, made in 1964. But inside, it was different. The plane had a long white tunnel with lights on the walls. Most seats were gone, except a few at the back. Thirteen students from Europe and America sat there. They were excited and nervous.
For a year, these students competed to be on this flight. The European Space Agency asked for creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight. The plane would fly up and down like a roller-coaster. At the top of each curve, the plane and everything inside became weightless for a few seconds.
The plane took off smoothly. But soon, it climbed steeply. The engines were loud, and we felt strange. Then, the engines stopped, and we felt weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence. It was hard to know which way was up or down.
After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot made the plane fly level again. Gravity returned, and some students fell to the floor. There were 30 curves in total, giving 10 minutes of weightlessness for experiments.
The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. A German team looked at how metal joins in space. Students from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films. These sails could help satellites move using the sun's light.
After two hours, we felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. One student said, ""It was unforgettable. I want to be an astronaut even more now."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Made a Home in New Zealand**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology.""
I had a strange time in my life when I didn't have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand. So, I had nine winters in a row. I liked it because I enjoy winter.
My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand. My father grew up there, so it was special. They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was okay for planting trees.
I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on farms, so planting trees sounded nice to me. I started planting in 1968, and by 1972, we had planted all 70 acres.
In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. It was a happy time, even though it rained almost every day. I was often wet and cold. Every morning, I got ready to plant more trees. I had a helper who knew how to plant trees, which was good because I was new to it.
We used a planting bag to carry the trees. It was hard work, but I liked it. We had to make sure the lines of trees were straight. Once we lined up the poles, we planted the trees in a straight line. I enjoyed the hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, planting became easy, like a rhythm.
While planting, I thought a lot about life and nature. These thoughts have stayed with me. I have visited New Zealand four times since then to see the trees grow. It makes me happy to see them doing well.
I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and healthy. In 1984, I took time off from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" there. I stayed in a small cabin with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings.
I still feel a strong connection to that place. It is where I feel most connected to the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Bringing Up Badgers**
""What now?"" I thought when a helper gave me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have a farm in Somerset. We help orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger babies. They were about eight inches long. Their fur was soft, and they had black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger babies before. They are usually born between January and March and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die.
These three babies were found by builders. They accidentally broke into the badger home with their machines. The mother was dead, and the babies were still with her. The babies were healthy but cold and crying. I cleaned them and put them by the stove to warm up. There were two girls, Primrose and Bluebell, and one boy, Willow. I fed them with a syringe and wiped them with a warm cloth to help them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Soon, they drank from a bottle and moved around a bit. They seemed happy with each other and a warm pad as a pretend ""mom.""
Three weeks later, Willow seemed tired but still ate. The next morning, he was dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. When feeding animals, they should not drink too fast, or liquid can go into their lungs. This happened to Willow, and he got sick. I was sad but kept caring for the others. Then, a farmer brought me another male badger baby. He was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II.
Willow II was hard to feed. I had to move the bottle around for him to drink. After a while, he learned to eat. By the end of April, the girls ate creamed rice and other foods. Willow II was messy with his food. I gave him a sausage, and he finally ate it. Soon, he ate other foods too.
At five months old, they ate cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds for dinner. Badgers usually eat earthworms, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were lucky because the summer was hot, and finding food was hard.
By August, the badgers became active at night. We walked in the orchard at dusk. They played and chased each other. Derek and I joined in, but he often got nipped. Other badgers came to our field looking for food. We were warned they might harm our badgers, so we made the pen safe.
The local press took pictures of us with the badgers. We started a project to build a home for them. With help, we made a sett with tunnels and a gate. It had three rooms, one with a glass side to see inside. The badgers explored it and soon moved in. A bus company helped with costs, and local firms gave materials.
One evening, the badgers moved into their new home. I checked on them and saw them sleeping. Now, I don't walk with them as much because they are awake late. Primrose visits sometimes, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before going out at night. This is their home now."
CAE_67,C1,"'Looking for True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet
Dr. Toby Clark works at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley. Anjana Ahuja tells us more. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for Halley's Comet. But he also did important work with compasses. He found out how to fix compass errors. This is called 'declination'. Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without it, sailors could not find their way on the ocean.
Halley was one of two men paid to do science in his time. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination. But the trip stopped early because the crew did not listen. Halley tried again. This time, he went to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he made a map showing compass variations. This map helped sailors for over 100 years.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate Halley's work. He plans to follow Halley's route on the ship Paramore. He needs to raise Â£70,000 first. Sir Vivian Fuchs, a famous explorer, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life and work. Halley was a great scientist and explorer. He also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book.
Dr. Clark's trip will also be scientific. He will take new measurements of the magnetic field. This will help update the Earth's magnetic field model. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will give him tools. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his work will fill in any missing data.
Halley's journey was the first big science trip on the sea. He was the first civilian naval captain for science. Dr. Clark has the skills for this trip. He spent two years in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio to England. He plans to finish the trip in four parts with different crews. Dr. Clark is very dedicated. He says, 'I am ready to spend eight months on this. Halley's life gives me a real purpose.'"

Darwin thought animals change over time through evolution. He said the strongest and smartest animals survive and have babies. But peacock tails seemed to be a problem because they are big and heavy. Darwin had an idea called ""sexual selection."" He thought female peacocks liked beautiful tails just because they looked nice.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought that if hens chose peacocks with fancy tails, there must be a good reason. Maybe these peacocks were healthier or better in some way.
Today, scientists like Marion Petrie study peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if hens really choose peacocks with the best tails and if these peacocks are better in other ways. They watch the peacocks and take pictures. They found that hens like peacocks with more eye-spots on their tails.
Another scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that peacocks with nice tails might be healthier and have fewer parasites. But it is hard to check this in the Whipsnade peacocks.
Marion Petrie is also looking at the babies of peacocks with nice tails to see if they grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it means hens choose mates for good reasons, like Wallace thought.
There is one more idea from a scientist named R A Fisher. He said that if a female picks a male with a nice tail, their children will also have nice tails. Over time, this could make peacock tails even fancier. This idea supports Darwin's thought that females might choose beauty just because they like it."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe says the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his boat, 'The Westerman'. 
In London, there is a big boat show with many new yachts. These yachts have new technology and are different from boats made 25 years ago. My boat is different. It is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It looks like it is 100 years old, but it was designed last year. Some people might think I am a romantic person because of this, but I am not sure. My boat uses old boat design ideas and new technology. 
New technology helps make boats, but it can also make sailing too easy. I think sailing should have some challenges. For example, I like my boat to have a coal stove for warmth and a nice place to sleep. But I also think sailors should sometimes work with the sails. 
Some boats have big cabins like a house, but I think a boat should feel like a boat. My old boat, Hirta, had no luxury. It had heavy sails, no electric water pump, no fridge, and no electronics. But it was a good boat to sail. 
Old boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I wanted a new boat, so I built one. The Westerman is my new boat. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew it on a napkin. Then he used a computer to make the design better. 
The Westerman is a great boat. It has crossed the North Atlantic and won races. It looks old but is made with new materials. It is strong and does not let water in. It feels like a real boat and shows that old ideas can still be good today."
CAE_44,C1,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**
Many people are visiting health farms and hotels with spa facilities. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**
I went to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors are very good. I felt more flexible each day. They offer many treatments like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff is very friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to add a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles or walk in the garden. I felt much better and full of energy after my stay. I want to visit again. This is a great place for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**
Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. It has a beautiful library and conservatory. When you arrive, you get a medical check-up. They check your weight and blood pressure. I found out I had a shoulder problem, and they helped me with it. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry and got a headache on the second day. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. The extra treatments are not too expensive. - Liz Gregory
**C. CAREYS MANOR**
Careys Manor is not a health farm. It is a nice old manor with log fires and a big lounge. The food is very tasty, but not for people counting calories. They have a gym and a pool. There is also a spa bath, steam room, and sauna. They have a sports injury clinic. I got advice for my shoulder injury. Careys is comfortable and luxurious. You can also explore the countryside. - Beverly D'Silva
**D. CLIVEDEN**
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens. The restaurant, Waldo's, has amazing food. I enjoyed a delicious meal and then used the gym to burn calories. I also had a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty options. - Kay Letch
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**
Springs Hydro has the best and worst carrot cake. It is delicious but has many calories. The aromatherapy massage is also great. I felt very relaxed and had a good night's sleep. The place is modern and well-run. They offer many treatments like manicures and facials. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to friends. I would like to visit once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,C1,"**Natural Talents**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means that the things that make us different from animals are new. Our ability to make art and do other human things comes from a small part of our genes. 
Animals and humans are not so different. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with sounds for different animals like 'leopard' or 'snake'. 
Art is one thing that seems special to humans. But our ancestors did not make art for a long time. The first clear human art, like cave paintings and statues, appeared about 35,000 years ago. 
People say human art is different because it is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinctive. 
1. **Not Useful**: Human art does not help us survive or have children. For example, birds sing to find a mate, but human art is more about sharing thoughts and feelings.
2. **Made for Beauty**: Humans make art for pleasure. We do not know if birds enjoy their songs, but they sing mostly to find a mate.
3. **Learned, Not Instinctive**: Human art styles are learned. People in different places have different art styles, like songs in Tokyo and Paris. Birds, however, are born knowing their songs.
Human art changes quickly. For example, paintings from the 20th century look different from older paintings like the Mona Lisa. 
Interestingly, chimpanzees like Congo and Betsy also made paintings. They painted for fun, not for a purpose. Their art was shown in a London gallery in 1957, and many paintings were sold. This shows that the line between human and animal art is not always clear. Some human art is also made for personal satisfaction, not to communicate with others."
CAE_39,C1,"Title: A Big Adventure
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived. There are not many big adventures left in the world. In the past, stories were about brave explorers. Now, you don't see many real-life heroes. But Charles Blackmore is one.
Charles Blackmore led a team across the Taklamakan Desert. The desert's name means ""once entered you never come out,"" and people call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home.
The team had four British people, one American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers were actually truck drivers, which was a mistake that could have been very dangerous.
They traveled 1,200 kilometers across the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a book about their journey. He left the Army after 14 years and wanted to do something different. His wife, Tina, was worried because no one had done this route before. It took them 59 days to cross the desert.
The team faced many problems: sickness, hot and cold weather, thirst, and losing some of their water. But they found water when they needed it most. They did not face the desert's famous sandstorms or very cold weather.
The sand got into everything, and climbing the high dunes was hard for them and the camels. They had no backup plan and were alone in the desert. Charles was worried about his physical strength but knew he had the mental strength.
At the end of the journey, they were tired but strong. Charles thought about his family while looking at the moon in the desert. He is proud of the adventure but values his family more.
Charles Blackmore still wants challenges and misses the adventure. He finds modern life too ordinary."
CAE_18,C1,"Susan Harr is tired of using too many gadgets. She decides to stop using some of them and finds joy in doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it makes life easier. But Susan thinks we depend too much on it. She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost a lot to fix. This made her think gadgets might not be worth the trouble.
Susan starts using fewer gadgets at home. She wonders if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets. When her sewing machine broke, she decided to sew by hand. She enjoys sewing by hand because it is relaxing and she can take her sewing with her anywhere. She also likes listening to the radio or talking with family while sewing.
Susan got rid of her color TV and now uses a small black-and-white one. This makes her watch only what is important. She spends more time walking the dog, reading, and talking with family. She also enjoys washing dishes by hand and daydreaming.
Susan now looks around her house and thinks about other gadgets she can live without, like the freezer or microwave. She realizes she can save money by using fewer gadgets."
CAE_62,C1,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker. He makes furniture like cupboards, tables, and bookcases. His workshop is in East London, under a railway arch. When you meet him, he seems like he is in a hurry. He is very busy because he has many orders. People know he makes good furniture, so they ask him to make things for them.
Hurst has been making furniture for ten years. He is very good at it and has a good reputation. He does not advertise, but people still find him. They know he makes beautiful furniture with simple designs. Hurst does not like furniture that is made quickly and not well. He wants his furniture to be perfect.
Hurst learned to make furniture by himself. He asked questions and learned from others. Most of his work is for people who want special furniture for their homes. Some people come back to him many times. He likes clients who know what they want.
Hurst is confident about his skills. He says he is naturally good at making things. But he also admires other good furniture makers. He does not like when people try to make furniture into art that is not useful. He believes furniture should be something people can use every day.
In the end, Hurst says, ""I am only making furniture."" This shows he is humble about his work."
CAE_49,C1,"'Why do we sleep? People sleep for about one-third of their lives. Sleep is very important, but we are not sure why. Scientists have three main ideas about why we sleep. The first idea is that sleep helps our body stay healthy. When we sleep, our body fixes itself and gets ready for the next day. The second idea is that sleep helps us learn. When we sleep, our brain organizes what we learned during the day. Without sleep, it is hard to learn new things. The third idea is that sleep gives us energy. We sleep to recharge, like a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"**Eccentrics**
An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow what is normal in society. But what is ""normal""? Many of us have small, strange habits. Maybe we like to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity means being unique.
Inside us, there are two forces. One is called individualism, which means being different. The other is conformity, which means being like everyone else. Most people want to be accepted and loved, so they choose conformity. They want to be part of a group and not stand out.
People with unusual hobbies or ideas often find others like them. They make clubs and have meetings to talk about their interests. They feel better when they are with others who understand them.
Sometimes, people want to show they are different. They might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me."" This is not eccentricity. It is just showing individuality.
Some people become famous by being different, like Bob Dylan, a singer. He said, ""When you know what you want to do, keep doing it."" But being different on purpose is not eccentricity. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care what others think. They do things because it is who they are.
Eccentrics are not like people who play jokes, want attention, or hide from others. These people think a lot about society. Eccentrics do not. They live their lives in their own way."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four nature experts to tell us about a book on wildlife that influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. Barbara Ward, a small and frail woman, is the most important. She was very involved in environmental issues in Europe after the war. She wrote about her experiences and ideas in her books. As a young journalist, her work helped me understand the environment better. Her book, ""The Home of Man,"" is about the fast growth of cities and the need for sustainable development. I think it is her most important book.
**B. Linda Bennett**
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a gull colony. This book explains how animals communicate. After reading it, watching a gull colony becomes more interesting. You can see how they work together. Niko Tinbergen was a scientist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with artist Eric Ennion to create this book. Ennion's paintings show the behavior of gulls with just a few lines and colors. This book is great for anyone who loves wildlife.
**C. Lee Durrell**
""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. I first read it while doing research in Madagascar. I was having a hard time, but this book made me feel better. It shows a world full of animals, people, joy, and beauty. It reminds us that all living things are connected like a family. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. I loved the 48 color pictures of birds by Eric Ennion. I already liked bird books and learned to identify birds during holidays. This book had more to offer. It had chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. It helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature is as important as a scientific one. Since I was better at art than math or physics, this book opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,C1,"Title: Do Reviews Help Sell Books?
We asked five important British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:
Publisher A: Reviews are very important for publishers. Many people buy books because of reviews. Both authors and publishers feel bad if there are no reviews. Publishers think that even bad reviews can help sell books because people want to see for themselves. Publishers like reviews that agree with their own thoughts about the book.
Publisher B: Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago. However, paperbacks often do not get enough attention. Reviews help people know about a book and can increase sales, especially if many reviews are positive.
Publisher C: Reviews are very important for us. We publish books by authors who are not very famous, so we need reviews to help sell our books. Good reviews are better than advertisements because they are honest. Reviews can help a book become popular, but they need help from other things like word-of-mouth and good marketing.
Publisher D: In the US, a review in the New York Times can make a book very popular. In Britain, it is different. Sometimes, it takes many years for people to notice a good writer. Some books sell well even without good reviews. It is hard to predict what will happen with reviews.
Publisher E: Publishers and writers want good reviews. But do they sell books? I published a book with great reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they knew the book from the reviews. The name of the reviewer used to matter more. Now, it is more about the review's style and originality that makes people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**Weathervane Maker**
Making weathervanes is a very old skill. It started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith makes weathervanes by hand in his workshop. He is one of the few people who do this in the country. Graham makes special designs for each customer. He says, ""This way, I can make a unique gift."" Many of his customers are women who buy gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.
The most common weathervane design is a cockerel (a rooster). But Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. Graham saw that he could make many different designs. So, he started a weathervane business.
Before this, Graham worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change roles. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of their children and build his business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He likes the creative part of his work.
Graham has made over 100 original designs. He works carefully and shows the design to the customer before cutting it by hand. He also keeps traditional designs because people like them too. Graham says people like handmade things because they are different.
Graham does not want to make his business bigger. He wants to keep it as a small craft. He says, ""I have found my place in the market. People love the unique designs."" Weathervanes help people know the wind direction and weather changes. More people are moving to the countryside, and they want special things for their homes. This helps Graham's business.
Graham is very busy now. He sends weathervanes to customers all over the world, especially in America and Denmark. The price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Graham can make a special gift for any occasion."
CAE_68,C1,"Title: Beginner Wins Big
Before it was published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was a very popular book. It is the first book by British writer Nicholas Evans. He made a lot of money from it. Here, he talks about his ideas and success.
At the start of the year, things were not good for Nicholas Evans. He is a writer and producer. A movie he was working on, called ""Life and Limb,"" was canceled. He was worried because he had not made money for two years. He needed money to pay the bank.
Instead of getting a job, Evans decided to go to America. He wanted to write his first book. He got the idea for the story from a man he met in Dartmoor. The man told him about a horse that changed from bad to good because of a ""horse whisperer."" Evans was interested and wanted to write a book about it.
He traveled across the US to learn about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about money. He showed the first part of his book to a friend who was a book agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money than that.
In October, Evans sent the first part of his book to publishers. Soon, his agent told him that someone offered $75,000 for the book. Evans was surprised. In one week, the book was sold for a lot of money in the UK and the US. It was a record for a first book. Big movie studios also wanted to make a film from it.
Evans was happy but did not want to write the movie script. He wanted to stay away from the movie business. He thought it was better to write another book."

CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work.
A. Volunteer tourists help build homes or schools. They pay a lot of money to do this work. This money could help more if given directly to the local community. Many volunteers are young and do not have special skills. Some people think young volunteers do this to help their careers, not just to help others. But, these projects can teach people to act kindly in their lives.
B. Volunteering can help people from different countries understand each other better. It can help solve problems and make people work together globally. Volunteers and the communities they help can both benefit. But, if only rich people volunteer, it might not help poorer communities much. Rich volunteers might only use this experience to help themselves.
C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be more about helping the volunteer than the community. But, it can also be a good way to share skills and learn about different cultures. Volunteering can make people care more about fixing problems like poverty and unfairness.
D. Volunteer tourism is about helping others. It is a simple way to make a difference. It does not involve big governments or businesses. But, it might not change the big problems in poor areas. Volunteering is good, but it should not replace real development work. It should not ignore the real reasons for poverty in the world."
CAE_55,C1,"'Choosing a Clock Radio Stuart Harris reports Many people listen to the radio in the morning and need an alarm to wake up. A clock radio can help. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios. One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model also has a cassette player, so you can listen to your own tapes. The radio quality is good, but it is big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case. This model was the best-looking and the winner. Paul Bridges liked it, but the clock sometimes stopped at 16.00. The digital display has grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. The clock has a backup power, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out. But it is hard to set up. Tom Granger said another model with a lamp is 'tacky'. The lamp is hard to use, and the clock jumps from 12.00 to 02.00. The radio is hard to tune, and the buzzer is loud. This model is popular with young people because it is colorful. Tom Granger liked it because it stands out. It is easy to set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges said it is 'fiddly' and 'useless'. The simplest and cheapest model is small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning. Tom Granger liked it because it is easy to set up. The radio quality is fine, and the buzzer works well. It got me out of bed in two beeps!'"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many places around the world, but not in America or Australia. When a hedgehog is scared, it can roll into a ball. This helps protect it because the spines stick out. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They might try to run away first and roll into a ball only if needed. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They sleep under bushes or in holes. All hedgehogs can sleep through the winter, but some do not if the weather is nice."

Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard went to Picasso's table and asked him to sign his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed it and even drew a little picture on the page. Richard was very happy and started talking to Picasso with the help of an American woman who translated for them.
Richard's friend suggested he draw a portrait of Picasso. Richard went back to Picasso's table and started drawing him. Picasso made funny faces and gestures, making it hard for Richard to draw. But then, Picasso sat still, and Richard could study his face. Picasso looked strong and young, even though he was almost 84 years old.
After Richard finished the drawing, Picasso wanted to see it. Richard was shy but showed it to him. Picasso then took the crayon and quickly drew a funny picture of Richard. Richard was amazed and thanked Picasso. He asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso said he had already signed once.
Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It was a special moment for him."
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:
A. **Fresh Look**
Supermarkets know people like fresh food. They put fruits and vegetables at the front of the store. They might also have a bakery that smells like fresh bread. The store might use green colors because green means fresh. Most things they sell, like frozen food, are not fresh.
B. **Product Placement**
Where things are in the store is important. Supermarkets know where people look the most. They put expensive or fast-selling items there. Shelves at eye level are the best spots. Special offers are in big bins to catch your eye. They also put things that go together, like salad dressing near salads.
C. **Staples Spread Out**
Stores put cheap things like bread and sugar far from the entrance. You have to walk past other things that might tempt you. Stores put popular items far away so you see more things as you look for them.
D. **Less is More**
Some stores show fewer items to make them look special. Next stores do this with clothes. They look like boutiques, but the clothes are not more special than other stores.
E. **Price Tricks**
People care more about the total bill than each itemâ€™s price. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some things cheap to get you in the store. They buy in big amounts to get discounts.
F. **Price Tags**
In chain stores, people notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference. It also helps stop theft because staff have to ring up the sale.
G. **Lighting**
Stores use special lights. Chain stores want natural light so clothes look the same outside. Supermarkets use lights to make food look better.
H. **Walking Paths**
Stores use different carpets to guide you. One type is for walking paths, another for sales areas. Some stores use wood or marble for paths to make you walk on the carpet in sales areas.
I. **In-Store Ads**
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of tasty food. In the U.S., some stores use video screens on shopping carts. The screens show ads for products as you shop. These are for people who buy on impulse. They can increase sales by 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"Chris Bonnington is a famous mountain climber. He climbed Mount Everest in 1985. He has also climbed in Britain and the Alps. Chris wrote books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way.""
Robin Knox-Johnston started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat, Sunhaili. He also set a record for sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days.
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland. They wrote about their trip in a book called ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""
In 1979, Chris was working on a book and called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to sail with him. Chris showed Robin how to climb, and Robin showed Chris how to sail. They became good friends.
Robin and Chris decided to go on a big trip to Greenland. Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone for their ideas before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring and hard. He liked being on land more. Robin liked fixing things on the boat.
In Greenland, Chris led the climbing. He was careful because if Robin fell, it could be dangerous for both of them. They tried to climb Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral. It was very hard, and they had to turn back the first time. Robin trusted Chris and followed him.
On the way home, there was a small problem. Chris was supposed to take a turn watching the boat, but Robin let him sleep. Chris thought Robin didn't trust him, but Robin explained it was not true.
By the end of the trip, Chris learned that Robin was a kind and sensitive person. They became good friends."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
**Early Apples**  
People have eaten apples for a very long time. In ancient times, people in places like Switzerland and Italy ate small wild apples. These apples were not like the ones we eat today.
**Apples in Britain**  
Around 1000 AD, the French brought apple-growing skills to Britain. They learned these skills from the Romans. British monks worked on creating new types of apples. Many apples we know today come from these early varieties.
**Popular Apples in the Middle Ages**  
In the 1200s, some apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a favorite dessert apple. The Costard was used for cooking. But later, fewer apples were grown because of problems like droughts and wars. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII wanted more apples, so he sent someone to France to learn about apple growing.
**Apples Around the World**  
By the 1700s, apples were very popular in Britain. People took apples with them when they moved to places like Canada, the US, Australia, and South Africa. In America, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees.
**New Apple Varieties**  
In the 1800s, new apples were discovered. In Iowa, a farmer found a new apple called 'Delicious'. In Australia, a woman named Maria Smith found a green apple, later called 'Granny Smith'.
**Modern Apples**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from just a few types. People want more different kinds of apples, not just the ones that look good. It's important to keep many types of apples alive for the future."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is in a place called Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya. Richard has trained in Kenya before, but this time he trains with Kenyan runners. He also runs his first race in Kenya. The race is in Nairobi and is the first international cross-country race in Africa. Many Kenyan runners finish before him, but he still feels he did well.
Kenyan runners are very good. They train at a high place, which helps them run better because it makes more red blood cells. But it's not just the high place that makes them good. They have a simple way of running and living. They enjoy running and competing.
Richard stays at the Kenyan national team training camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, high up on Mount Kenya. The camp is simple, with few comforts. The runners live with college students and share rooms. They run three times a day: in the morning, mid-morning, and afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sunday when they run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their face and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they go to a stream to wash.
Richard learns that Kenyan success is not just about where they train. It is also about their simple lifestyle, hard work, and love for running. These might be the real reasons why Kenyan runners are so good."
CAE_7,C1,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**
Advertising is having problems. It's not just because of the bad economy. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the economy got worse. The problem is bigger and affects the whole world. Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now there are many brands and media, and markets are smaller. Big brands should focus on small groups, but they often don't. This is where advertising is going wrong.
Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. In a year, you might buy a few hundred brands. Big items like cars? Maybe one every three years. Clothes? Not many are advertised brands. Even with candy, medicine, and other things, you probably buy less than 400 brands a year.
There are 32,500 advertised brands. Let's look at the 9,500 brands that spend a lot on advertising. Most people buy about 400 of these brands, not all because of ads. That's about 4%. So, 96% of advertising might be wasted. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 ads. The rest are wasted.
You might think ads don't affect you, but they do. Most people don't buy most brands they see in ads. Waste is part of advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest. But advertising can still work. It reaches many people to find the few who will buy. It's a cheap way to talk to many people.
Advertisers try to waste less by targeting better, but they can't know exactly who will buy. Even direct mail doesn't get 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might sell to everyone they talk to. If advertisers knew who would buy, they wouldn't need media. They could talk to people directly.
If an ad gets one million new customers, it's doing well. For soap, the top brands would be happy with a million new customers. Any ad campaign that gets 2% of people to buy is very successful. This is a small part of the population. To reach them, mass media is still useful, but ads need to be more focused."
CAE_43,C1,"'Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. This home is in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Southwell has an old cathedral called Southwell Minster. It also has Britain's greenest house, called the 'autonomous house'. Robert and Brenda Vale designed and built this house. They use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle their waste into garden compost. They heat their house with heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat. The house looks traditional with a clay roof. It is 300 yards from the Minster. The house is very quiet because it is super-insulated. The windows are triple-glazed, so you do not hear any noise inside. Inside, you must take off your shoes. The house is very still and quiet. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air. The Vales open windows to let air in. Even their cats have a special door. The Vales teach architecture at Nottingham University. They care about the environment. They wrote a book called The Autonomous House in the 1970s. They wanted a house that does not harm the environment. They use rainwater and have special toilets. They do not use a dishwasher. The house does not have water bills. Last winter, they used very little electricity. Soon, they will have solar panels to make more electricity. They have a small wood stove for very cold days. In winter, the house is warm enough without extra heating. The house is simple and easy to fix. It was cheap to build. The Vales want to show that it is possible to live in a house that is good for the environment.'"
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man, like a scientist. But in 1920, he saw photos of fairies in a garden and believed they were real. He published these photos with an article, saying fairies were amazing. In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them among flowers. The photos looked very nice. But this simple trick shows that cameras can lie. Today, we use computers to change our photos, and it is not true that photos were always honest. From the start, photos could be changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"Blacksmiths
Iron has always been important to people. The men who work with iron, called blacksmiths, are very skilled. Before machines were common, blacksmiths were as important as doctors. They made weapons, armor, and tools for farming. Blacksmiths also made beautiful art. In the 1700s, they made ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. In France and Belgium, they made special metalwork for buildings.
By the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain. Big factories did not need them anymore. But in the last 10 years, blacksmiths are becoming popular again. People like nice designs in their homes. Some blacksmiths make things that look old, like 'Victorian-style' gates. But there are new ideas too.
There is an exhibition of blacksmiths' work in Leatherhead, Surrey. It is by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says blacksmiths can now use power tools. This makes their work easier. They can bend and shape metal more easily. The exhibition has about 250 pieces, like bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at Â£90. Most money goes to the makers, but some helps promote good ironwork.
Alan Dawson made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says working with steel is like drawing with metal. Many artists love working with iron. Susan May, a jeweller, says iron is soft when hot but hard when cold. Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles. She likes that steel feels strong and lasting.
Iron is a special metal. It looks nice and makes people feel safe. Iron will probably be used for decoration for many years."
CAE_14,C1,"Title: The Day I Stopped Smoking
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She said, ""If it was so easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It was strange to me too.
I went to a stop-smoking session that mixed group therapy and hypnotherapy. This happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who wanted me to stop smoking. I was healthy, didn't cough, and got over colds quickly.
On a normal Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" in Birmingham. I was there to write an article about other people trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't try to stop because I'm here to write, not to quit."" I enjoyed smoking and it made me happy.
The counselor seemed to know something I didn't. We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. But when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. The idea of stopping smoking started to make sense to me. It felt powerful to think about not being a smoker.
Stopping was easier than I thought. The craving for nicotine went away after a minute or two, and I only felt it for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't. The hardest part was being at home on weekend mornings. Smoking was something I did when I was bored.
I do miss smoking, but not too much. I have to get used to doing things without smoking, like eating out, waiting for a plane, or going to the theater. These were times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,C1,"Dorothy Hodgkin was a British woman scientist who won a Nobel prize. She is not very famous in Britain, but she should be. Dorothy was the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel prize. If she were a writer, everyone would know her name. Dorothy was an amazing person. She studied crystals and lived through big changes in the 20th century, like better education for women and science becoming more global.
I wanted to learn more about her, so I read other scientists' biographies. I found out that not many people know about scientists' lives. Some people think scientists' lives are boring, but that's not true. Scientists can have interesting lives, just like artists or politicians. Some scientists don't like to be in the media because they don't want to seem like they are showing off. But now, more scientists are appearing on TV and in public, which helps people see them as real people.
Books about scientists are also changing. They used to be serious and not very interesting. Now, they show scientists as real people with families and normal lives. For example, Richard Feynman wrote a funny book about his life. Even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are shown with their personal stories.
Dorothy Hodgkin loved her work. She discovered the structure of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin. She won the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1964. She also had three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life was important too. We can learn from how she balanced her work and family.
Understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. It's sad that many people don't know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. They are important and have given us a lot."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and her special skill
Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines to drill, but Margaret only needs a forked stick to find water. They are successful more than 90% of the time.
Finding water this way is called dowsing. Some people think it is like having a 'sixth sense'. There are different ideas about how it works. Some say it is because everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more. Dowsers, like Margaret, might feel these vibrations. Some say they can even smell water.
Margaret is very busy, especially when there is little rain. She helps farmers, people with holiday homes, and golf course builders. She looks for water deep underground, between 50 and 70 meters. It is important to find clean water, away from farm waste. The water is in hard rock, so it stays clean. They also need electricity to pump the water, so the well should be near power lines.
Margaret starts by looking at a map with a pendulum. The pendulum swings over places with water. Then, she walks with her stick over the land. When she is above water, she feels something special. The stick moves up when water is below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If they are not sure, they keep looking.
Margaret's skill is not common, but it works well for her business. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This means she understands the land in a special way. This skill helps her family run their well-drilling business successfully."
CAE_36,C1,"**We changed lives for a day!**
Have you ever wanted to live someone else's life for a day? We helped four people do just that. Here is what happened.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda is 23 years old and has two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.
Amanda had never been to a place like the restaurant before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. She had to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It was hard, and she dropped the drinks on the floor. The other waitresses laughed and said it happens to everyone at first.
By 11:30 am, there was a line of people waiting to come in. Amanda was nervous about remembering orders, but everything was done by computer. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was too much. She had to keep saying ""Pardon?"" because she couldn't hear the customers.
By 5 pm, Amanda was very tired and wanted to rest her feet. She was surprised when a waitress said it was a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized waitressing is hard work. She thought it was for shy people, but you need to be friendly and calm. She was happy to go back to her children. It seemed easy after waitressing!
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for a day. She thought she could handle Amanda's cheeky daughters. She had to dress and feed them, take Sophie to school, and Katie to nursery. Cindy thought she would have some free time, but she had to clean the house and do the washing.
After picking up Katie and shopping, she brought Sophie home. The girls were very energetic and noisy. Cindy thought they would get tired, but they didn't. She finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV.
Cindy found looking after children very tiring. She didn't have time for herself and felt a big responsibility. But she enjoyed the day.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary is 42 and runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old teacher.
On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was nice. She was nervous about looking right for school. At assembly, she saw 400 pupils and hoped she blended in.
She helped with a maths class and a nature project. By lunchtime, she was tired but only had five minutes to eat. After lunch, there was a reading lesson and a French lesson. The children wanted to practice French with her.
The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Rosemary decided she preferred farming, even though teachers get more holidays.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary arrived at the farm at 8:30 am. Rosemary had been up for three hours already! The farm has 100 cows, 15 calves, and 800 sheep. They make milk, ice cream, and yogurt.
Hilary spent the morning bottling milk and making ice cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. She fed the calves and started milking the cows, which took two and a half hours.
Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. She realized farming is hard work with little time off. Rosemary only gets about three days' holiday a year. Farming seems nice, but it is very different in reality."

He is 30 years old. His parents did not play music, but they gave him a trumpet as a Christmas present when he was eight. His father liked Louis Armstrong, so he bought a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved it and played all the time. His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, who was in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. Bo saw that Hakan had talent. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher. Bo loved the trumpet and helped Hakan a lot. Hakan learned to work with the trumpet's imperfections. He always wanted to be a solo artist, not in an orchestra. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter. Hakan's parents supported his dream. At 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud also thought playing in an orchestra was not for Hakan. At 17, Hakan entered a competition in Paris. He did not win first prize, but he learned he could connect with people through music. Hakan does not like to explain why he can communicate well with music. He thinks it might ruin the magic of music.'"

CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Be a Leader at Work**
A. **What is a Good Leader?**
A good leader is someone who inspires others and helps them change. A leader shows the way forward. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says leadership is about making things happen with people who are excited like you. A good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. They say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. **Can You Be a Leader?**
John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says many people can be leaders. We all have some talents to be leaders. We just need the right time and place to use them. We can see big leaders like Mahatma Gandhi or Richard Branson. But leadership is also important in our own jobs.
C. **Think About Your Bosses**
Think about the best and worst boss you had. Both may be good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But the best boss made you feel good and supported. The worst boss made you feel small and blamed you when things went wrong. The first boss led well; the second just managed badly.
D. **Leaders vs. Managers**
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work with rules. Leaders make new ideas. A good manager can keep a company running. A good leader can change a company or team for the better.
E. **Improve Your Leadership Skills**
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you care about and act on it.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Believe in your ability to lead.
- Sometimes you need to lead strongly. Try different ways to lead and see what works.
- Set goals and try to beat them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you.
F. **Keep Learning to Lead**
- Leadership grows from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes.
- Learn to share work, motivate others, and give praise.
- Your way of leading may not always work. Keep improving your communication.
- Be seen and available to important people. But remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where you can help others become leaders too."

CAE_42,C1,"Title: Using Technology at Home
Georgina McGuiness stopped working in journalism for a long time. She felt she didn't know much about new technology. Here, she tells how she changed her home into a good place to work.
Two years ago, Georgina turned 37. She wanted to start her journalism career again. Her skills were old, from the 1980s, when people used typewriters. She didn't know how to use computers or desktop publishing. She was afraid of technology, even simple things like calculators.
Georgina thought it would be hard to work again. But then, she entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package. Her family got a laptop and a personal computer. They started learning about the Internet and using new words like ""cyberspace"" and ""surfing.""
Georgina set up a small office in her kitchen. She had a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. She could work from home and still take her children to school. Her children were good with computers because they learned at school. Georgina was scared at first, thinking she might lose her work by pressing the wrong button. But she learned the basics and found it easy.
Now, Georgina writes two articles a month for a magazine. She is happy because she can work and be with her family. The computer helps her stay organized. She uses spreadsheets to track money and has ready-made invoices and letterheads.
The Internet helps her find information for her stories and talk to other people about working from home. But working from home can be lonely. There are also distractions, like house chores and sharing the computer with her children.
Many people now buy computers for work and fun. In Georgina's street, more people work from home because they don't have to travel to the city. A report says the average computer user is 38 years old, well-educated, and owns a computer. Georgina feels she is doing well. She hopes to send her work to newspapers or even start her own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless."
CAE_59,C1,"The Tartan Museum
The Museum of Scotland is a new building in Edinburgh. It looks very different from the old buildings around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened to see what was inside.
The museum is easy to find. It is on Chambers Street in Edinburgh. The building is big and yellow, with a tall tower and a garden on top. Some people like the modern design, while others do not.
Inside the museum, there are many interesting things to see. The museum tells the story of Scotland with many old and special objects. You can see things like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel. The museum is not just for experts; it is for everyone, even if you do not know much about history.
Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants visitors to have a good time. He believes the museum should show the truth about the past. There are no fake scenes, only real objects with explanations.
The museum has many rooms with different shapes and sizes. There is a lot of light, and you can see everything clearly. There is also a special area for children to learn and play.
On the top floor, there is a gallery about the twentieth century. It shows things that people in Scotland think are important, like an electric guitar and a television. This part of the museum will change every three years.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects help us understand the past. The museum's modern design looks good from the inside, but some people are not sure if it fits with the old city around it."
CAE_54,C1,"'The end of print newspapers might take a long time. Change can be scary for some people. But transition means moving slowly and nicely from now to the future. For newspapers, moving to the online world is not easy. Many people think it will happen because print newspaper sales are going down, and more people visit newspaper websites. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have fewer print sales, but their websites have more visitors. 
However, not everything fits this idea. The World Association of Newspapers says global newspaper sales went up by 1.1% last year. In Asia, sales increased, even though they went down in the West. News magazines also grew by 5.4%. 
Books show a similar trend. E-readers like Kindle are selling well, but physical book sales only went down by 0.4%. People still like both screens and paper. 
Young people are not completely stopping reading newspapers. Almost 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read national newspapers. In Europe, different countries have different stories. In Britain, print sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop was only 7%. In France, it was just 3.1%. 
In the US, online ads were supposed to help newspapers, but now they are not doing as well. Many US newspapers have paywalls, where people pay to read online. The best way to get people to pay is to offer both print and online access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions. Print ads make more money than online ads. 
Keeping both print and online newspapers is hard and expensive. But print still helps newspapers stay popular. On the web, it is harder for newspapers to be noticed.'"
CAE_32,C1,"**Taking Photos of People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more interesting than one without. But, taking good photos of people can be hard. You need to think about how they move and their expressions. Sometimes, people act differently when they see a camera.
**A. Group Photos**
When taking group photos, don't make people stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles or levels. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces. You can also stand higher to take the photo.
**B. Posing for Photos**
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable pose. They can fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. Taking Photos of People**
Don't pretend you are not taking a photo. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their photo taken. They might feel shy at first, but they usually like it. Make sure they are not looking away from the camera.
**D. Eye Contact**
A photo is more powerful if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. If they get distracted, remind them to look at the camera. You can also say something funny to get a real smile.
**E. Looking at Something**
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the photo. This can make the photo interesting. It looks like you are watching them without them knowing.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures show a lot about a person. A laughing child makes us smile. A sad face makes us feel sad too. Look for familiar expressions like winks, anger, or thumbs-up. They are easy to understand.
**G. Backgrounds**
A background can make a photo more interesting. Make sure the background is not too busy. Focus on the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**
When people talk, argue, or joke, you can take good photos. Photos of couples, mothers and babies, or people working together are nice. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake.
**I. People and Places**
Many photos are taken on holiday. To show people with a nice background, use a wide-angle lens. Move back to get the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera. This way, you can see both the people and the place.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want the photo. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose. But family photos can be boring if they are all posed. Candid photos, taken without posing, are more fun and natural. They help you remember moments better."
CAE_65,C1,"**Sarah's Art**
Sarah Janson is an artist who makes paintings that trick the eye. Her art looks very real. She doesn't like to talk about herself much. She thinks the art is more important than the artist. Sarah has been making this kind of art for 16 years. She learned to draw at art school and worked in a publishing house. But she didn't like it much. Then she worked with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to make a trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it. 
Sarah is very good at looking at details. She says you can't really teach trompe-l'oeil; you learn by looking at things. She is always trying to get better. Sarah sometimes jokes about her mistakes, like when she says she can't paint bread well. She also talks about how hard it was to paint a big ceiling at Lulworth Castle. 
Sarah's art is very special. She has done many big projects for companies and private clients. Her work often looks like buildings or rooms. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace. She also painted a hallway to look like it leads to more rooms. 
Sarah says trompe-l'oeil must trick you and make you think. It should also be special for the person who asked for it. She likes to talk to her clients to get ideas. Many of her clients become her friends. Sarah is thankful for her clients and is always busy with new projects. She doesn't like to brag about her work, but her art is very interesting and deserves to be known."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
**A** The way we work is changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or our skills, but also by how we handle ourselves and others. This is called emotional intelligence. It is important for getting jobs and doing well at work. Emotional intelligence is about social skills and personal qualities like being able to understand others and adapt to changes. It is not about doing well in exams.
**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, so personal qualities are important. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. It is not just about being nice; sometimes it means telling the truth even if it is hard. It is about managing feelings well so people can work together.
**C** Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as important. It helps people work better together, especially in complex jobs. Companies where people have good emotional intelligence do better. Teamwork and understanding customers are important, and emotional intelligence helps with this.
**D** Unlike IQ, which stays the same, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. We can get better at handling emotions and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence skills, which are important when jobs are not stable. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution, but it helps everything work better."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and phones make it easy to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, news often starts on social media, and some journalists use these pictures for their stories. Sometimes, they use these pictures without asking. There are rules that say you can use pictures from social media without asking if it is very important for the public. But people still talk about whether this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means that these pictures are important for the future of news. But, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people get credit and ask for permission before using their pictures.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
**Acupuncture** is a very old treatment from China, about 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes using herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help with many health problems, especially pain. Some doctors, nurses, and therapists in the West use it to help with pain.
**What is Acupuncture?** In traditional Chinese medicine, being healthy means your body's energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), is balanced. Qi moves through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ. If Qi is blocked or weak, you might feel sick. An acupuncturist checks your health by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health and habits. They use thin needles on the skin to help Qi flow better.
**Acupuncture Points** There are over 300 points on the body where needles can be placed. These points are on the meridians and might not be near where you feel pain. When a needle is used, you might feel a dull ache or tingling. This means the needle has reached the Qi.
**How Does It Work?** Some doctors believe acupuncture helps with pain because it can block pain signals or release natural painkillers in the body.
**What Pain Can Be Treated?** People with long-term pain, like back pain, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery, often try acupuncture. It is also used for menstrual pain and nerve pain.
**Modern Use** Acupuncture has been used in China for a long time, but using it instead of anesthesia in surgery started in the 1950s. In China, it is used in many surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to have fewer side effects than regular anesthesia.
**Is It Effective?** Studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helps with long-term pain. It usually takes six or seven visits to feel better, but some improvement can be felt after two or three visits.
**Different Views on Pain** Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They consider things like weather and how the pain feels to decide how to treat it.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist** Some doctors are trained in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist who will refer you to a doctor if needed."

CAE_5,C1,"'Handwriting can show who you are In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. People believe that your handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, called graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Some researchers say it can help find illnesses like heart disease and cancer. It can also show how a person feels or if they have emotional problems. Many big companies use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. But many doctors and psychiatrists do not believe in graphology. Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should. She says handwriting can show if a person is smart, what job they might be good at, and if they are honest or tricky. Ms. Marne believes graphology can help find out if someone might be a criminal. She says criminals often have messy handwriting. She can tell if someone is honest or a good worker. She also says handwriting can show if a person is under a lot of stress or if they might hurt themselves. Changes in handwriting can show health problems too. Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to read handwriting well. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a real science. But some doctors do not agree. They say handwriting is just about how you learned to write and does not show anything else.'"
CAE_41,C1,"'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy team, says a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how good they are for working. Our expert team included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies how people work), and an occupational psychologist. Here is what they found. Office A. Advertising Agency Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no air systems, windows open to the street. It is hard to see why it works, but the small team seems happy. They change with the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, like at home. This might be why they are happy: a team of seven people made a nice, home-like office and do not have to follow many rules. Ergonomist: The furniture is mixed; no two pieces are the same. Some furniture is bad for working. Chairs are old, most can't be adjusted, and many are broken. But the team has different tasks, like office work, meeting clients, and giving presentations. This variety helps them not get tired or bored. Occupational Psychologist: Staff like the different work and flexible office space. They said the office is 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what others are doing, big enough to work alone. The office is fun and shows both efficiency and creativity. Office B. News Service Building Health Consultant: The office is not exciting but comfortable, and staff do not dislike it. Air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy. Ergonomist: The company already used an ergonomist. Chairs, lighting, and computers are good. Space is good, but the layout could be better. The office is plain and not exciting, with grey walls. Occupational Psychologist: Walls have year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are okay. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information more easily. Success stories or project information could be on the walls. Office C. Bank Building Health Consultant: People have mixed feelings about this office. It feels like being in a glass box, looking at many similar boxes. Even with smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air is not stale. You can't smell smoke even 1.5 meters away. Ergonomist: The office is very standard and not inspiring. Desks are just okay. Not all chairs are good for computer work, but this is user choice. Computer screens are on small desks with low keyboard shelves, which is not good for modern equipment. Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and have good technology. Many communication awards are on display. The wood panels and brown carpet make it look a bit dark. The office is busy. Office D. Newspaper Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this office. The air-conditioning is bad, causing big temperature changes. The space is messy, and desks are too small. The office is dusty, with dust falling from the roof. Ergonomist: The furniture looks like it belongs in a workshop, not a high-tech office. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially shorter people. Many chairs are old, can't be adjusted, and have armrests that keep users too far from the desk. Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust everywhere. The office needs cleaning, more recognition for success, and better air conditioning because there are many smokers. Few people talked when we visited; everyone seemed stressed and busy with deadlines. The company should work more as a team.'"
CAE_38,C1,"Chewing Gum Culture
Chewing gum is very popular. Americans chew 12 million pieces every day. Chewing gum started a long time ago and is now a big business. Each piece of gum has less than ten calories. It is called a food, so it must follow food rules in America. 
Today, gum is mostly made from man-made materials. It has pine resins and softeners to keep the taste and make it feel nice to chew. Long ago, people used natural gum. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked it to clean their teeth and make their breath smell nice. 
In America, early settlers learned from Native Americans to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people sold spruce gum in the eastern United States. This was the first chewing gum sold in America. 
Modern gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic. But growing sapodilla trees for chicle did not work well. As more people wanted gum, companies made synthetic gum. 
Today, a few people still collect chicle. They are called chicleros. Their job is hard and dangerous. They walk long distances in hot, humid forests. There are many dangers like snakes and insects. The chicle fly is a big problem because it lays eggs in people's ears and noses. Chicleros climb trees with a rope and an axe to get the chicle. They carry it to a camp, boil it, and make it into bricks. Life at the camp is tough, with little food and only local alcohol to drink. 
Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. America used to buy a lot of chicle, but now it buys much less. As gum sales go up, companies use synthetic materials to save money and make more gum. 
Gum makers find new ways to sell their products. They say gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress. During the world wars, soldiers got gum to chew. Gum is also said to help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms and can cause tooth decay. Our saliva helps protect our teeth. Chewing gum for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow. 
Gum companies are always working on new textures and flavors. They use glycerine and vegetable oils to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural help. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the two most popular gum flavors."

This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this hotel is special,' she says. 'It has three red stars, and I expect better.' Red stars mean the Globe is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide from the company she works for. Even before the cold welcome, there were problems. The way from the car park was through a door with a buzzer and a long, empty hallway to the hotel entrance. 'Not what I expected,' says Sue. Could it get worse? Yes. 'We have no record of your booking,' says the receptionist. That night, 12 of the hotel's 15 rooms are empty. One room is on the top floor. Sue does not like it: it is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. When she started her job, people thought she was tough. 'The Woman in Black, they called me,' she remembers, 'which was funny because I never wore black. And I was never too tough.' The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks scared. Before she says more, he apologizes for the bad smell in the main lounge.

Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months. Sue says her check will help the hotel in the long run. Not everything is bad. She praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, who shared notes about the building's 400-year history. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, 'What do we need to get three rosettes?' Sue says, 'Don't serve a pudding that falls apart.' Greaves' hope fades. Sue's job is to say the things other people are too scared to say. 'Sometimes it's hard. Once, a woman said I got her son fired. I just told the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers.' Sue also writes a full report for the hotel. They pay to be in the guide. Having red stars is worth it. Greaves is happy to hear Sue will not take away the Globe's red stars. That is the good news. The bad news is another inspector will come in the next two months to check again. 'Good,' says Greaves, not very happily. 'We'll look forward to that.''"
CAE_48,C1,"**Seven Up Mountaineer Doug Scott**
Doug Scott is a mountain climber. He climbed the highest mountain on each continent. These are called the Seven Summits. He started climbing them later in his life. Here are some of his stories:
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his friend Dougal climbed Mt. Everest. They stayed in a snow cave near the top. Dougal talked to someone who was not there. Doug thought this was because of low oxygen. Doug's feet were very cold, and he worried about frostbite. But he felt calm and confident with Dougal. They reached the top by finding a good climbing rhythm.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is a very dangerous mountain. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal climbed it. They carried all their equipment and food on their backs. The mountain felt higher because of low air pressure. They reached the top after a hard climb.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and Paul went to climb Mt. Kenya. But they got a free ride to Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain. They got lost in the jungle and had little water. They found a trail and reached the top using the Umbwe route.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, went to Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil. They decided to take a different route with him. They reached the top and met other climbers who wanted to climb the Seven Summits too.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug decided to climb Vinson Massif in Antarctica. In November 1992, his team went there. The sun was always up, and it was very cold. They reached the top in 8 hours, even with strong winds and low visibility.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In 1994, Doug's team went to Elbrus. They started at 3,900m and walked to a refuge at 4,200m. They thought they reached the top, but there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and went down the next day.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
Doug's team wanted to climb Carstensz Pyramid and meet the local Dani people. They were warned about bandits but continued. On May 12, they climbed and reached the top. Doug completed his goal of climbing the Seven Summits."

FCE_19,B2,"'Luxury and Modern Technology at the Merrion Hotel The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to make this hotel by changing four old houses. The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses a computer system. This system helps give special service to guests who come back. It cost a lot of money, but MacCann says it will be worth it. The system remembers what guests like. For example, if a guest asks for certain music, it will be ready for them next time. Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little, or the front desk can change it more. Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and video-conferencing. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. TVs and DVD players can be updated easily. Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large rooms, a swimming pool, gym, conference rooms, bars, restaurants, and a garden. The food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the hotel. This is good for both him and the hotel. The Merrion Hotel is ready to succeed with its technology and great staff.'"
FCE_24,B2,"Susan Shepherd is an artist. She is famous for painting flowers. She has a big garden around her house. This garden has many flowers she likes, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. The garden looks nice because of the colors and shapes of the flowers. The people who lived there before Susan loved gardening and left many plants. They also left a gardener named Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but he understood when she said she wanted to paint them.
Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She sometimes paints a group of flowers, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She paints it for a few days, then adds another flower to the painting. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. She is very busy in spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She likes to watch how flowers change over time. For example, tulips change shape when you put them in water.
Susan has always liked plants. She studied plants in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers before because they looked fake to her. She liked wild flowers because they grew in hard places like rocks. Now, her garden has plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas. She lets the garden grow freely, like a kind aunt who lets children play. Susan is busy with two art shows, so she hired another gardener. But she still likes to work in the garden because it helps her connect with her flowers."
FCE_13,B2,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell down during the big storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees in the market square. This changed how the town looked, and some people were not happy about it. One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. But during the storm, Pelham was very sick with bronchitis, so he did not notice the changes. 
Pelham was usually healthy, but he got very sick for the first time. He had a headache and chest pain. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but Pelham thought he was too important at work to take a break. This made him forget things and get angry easily. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. The doctor gave him medicine, and Sergeant Lloyd took him home to Molly, who sent him to bed.
On Thursday morning, Molly told Pelham that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen. Pelham was too sick to understand. On Thursday night, he asked if the house was damaged. When he heard it was not, he was happy and went back to sleep. On Saturday, the medicine worked, and Pelham felt better. He got up and saw that the living room looked different without the walnut tree. 
Pelham's house was big with a nice garden. He liked the privacy the garden gave them. But now, without the tree, the living room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was not nice anymore. The tall house next door, which the tree used to hide, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch them.
Pelham said to Molly, ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" But Molly was happy. She said, ""I've been telling you we need a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,B2,"Living in the Valley
We lived in our valley for sixteen months before we understood the dangers in the hills around us. One year, the storms came early, even before November ended. Before this, we felt safe in our valley with the hills around us. 
Soon, snow started to fall. In one day, it was 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we only felt strong gusts of wind. The trees moved, but the branches did not break. We knew we had to be careful. The snow and wind were a problem, but they did not worry us too much. The river, called the Ryburn, was the real danger. It usually flowed gently, but it could be dangerous if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams.
The snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds over the hills. They warned us of more bad weather. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted, and more rain came from the clouds. The reservoir in the hills was filling up and was almost too full. Then, for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river was very strong and fast near our home. It was deeper than we had ever seen it. For three days, we hoped it would not flood. Luckily, the dam held, and the water went down.
Before the dam was built, the river often flooded the villages nearby. Now, the dam controls the river, and everything is usually okay. We can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel safe in our home. The dam keeps us secure and safe."
FCE_21,B2,"Mark Adams is a film critic. He writes about movies for a newspaper called The Front Page. This was his first real job. Before this, he wrote reviews for books, movies, and radio. He met Tom Seaton, who was the first arts editor at The Front Page. Tom hired him. Tom wanted a team to review books, TV, theater, film, and radio. They would have lunch every week to choose what to review. It felt like a dream to Mark because it was a new newspaper, and he was part of it. He was surprised when he saw someone reading his review on the train. 
Tom's plan for a team of critics did not work out. People liked to know one critic for one subject, so Mark chose to write about films. Now, he writes one long article each week about one movie. He likes this way of working. He does not want to review every movie because it would be boring for him. 
Mark thinks people choose movies because of the stars, the ads, or the director. He does not think his reviews change people's minds about what movies to see. He does not feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. He just wants to share his opinion. He is not a judge and does not want to be one."

Many people watch athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and run 10km without stopping. It is exciting to watch, but why do athletes do it? And why does a smart 17-year-old girl give up everything for it? Melanie Sears has not learned to say things like ""personal satisfaction"" or ""mental challenge"" like other athletes. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then get on your bike while still wet. You freeze.

It was easy, and I waved at my team-mates."" She then entered the National Championships. She was fast at swimming and running but got lost cycling. ""I cycled 20km too far and cried while running.""

FCE_70,B2,"'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about collecting things and why many people like this hobby. I love collecting, and many adults do too. Collecting is fun and exciting. But remember, only collect things you love. People have collected things for a long time. Long ago, people collected pretty stones. They wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they look nice. I have collected many things in my life, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a faraway place in England. It was cold and windy. My parents took me to a museum there. I loved the old things in the museum. Many people like collecting. Some people collect because it makes them feel in control. I collect because I enjoy it. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with many interesting things. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You don't need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I once got a special tulip from another collector, but it was later stolen. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I found them all over the USA. But my dolls were lost in a house fire. I was very sad. Collections can change owners. A silver spoon might have belonged to a king or a poet. This makes it special. Some old toys are now worth a lot of money if you kept the boxes. I threw mine away, so they are not worth much now.'"

It is a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, own the house. They made the house bigger, but they did it very nicely. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel our friends liked, but we did not like it because the food was very bad. The four of us, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I, have played cards together for a long time. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We think it is a funny coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling when we arrived this year. She always knows when guests are coming, and she waits in the big hall that smells like flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' These are the names of the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of numbers. In winter, when it is quiet, she does things like that, and her husband fixes things. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming in from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he said in an Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt like our holiday had really started. Nothing changed at Glencorn, everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came to say hello. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur took our bags to the rooms, carrying as much as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the trip. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June, Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others going to the seashore. In the morning, we would do the same: walk on the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then come back for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere.

She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's class. Years ago, Marie's class came to see how Seymour made gloves. Marie loved the laying-off table, where workers shaped and pressed gloves on hot brass hands. The hands were shiny and stood up from the table, looking flat. Marie called them 'pancake hands' because they were strange.
Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked more questions. Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained that the tannery was a contractor. They bought the material and made it ready for the factory. Seymour's grandfather and father worked in the tannery, and so did he for six months. He asked Rita if she had ever been inside a tannery. She said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered to arrange a visit for her. He said tanneries were old places, and the work was hard. He told her that tanning was one of the oldest industries, with remains found in Turkey from 6,000 years ago.
Seymour said his father was the real expert on leather and could talk about gloves for days. He asked Rita if she had ever seen anything being made. She said she hadn't, except for her mother making a cake when she was a child. Seymour laughed. Rita was eager to learn, and she reminded him of Marie. Marie was smart and remembered everything she learned at school.

They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and he jumped off the roof onto the sawdust. He laughed and said, 'I dare you all! You're all scared!' His friends looked down, scared, but then they jumped too. They laughed and felt happy. They lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one friend said, 'Let's jump again.' They went back up and jumped again, but Michael stayed on the roof. His friends called, 'Come on, Mike. What's wrong?' Michael wanted to jump but was scared. He tried to count to ten and jump, but he couldn't. His friends laughed and got tired of waiting. They started to leave, shouting at him. Michael stayed on the roof, feeling sad and scared.

I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The test felt like a school exam. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. The tests had things like finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the test, I talked to an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and advice.

FCE_22,B2,"Title: Fun at the Dentist's
If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dentist office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings and a nice blue couch. Jerome says many people only go to the dentist when they have pain because they are scared. To help with this, he tries to make his office a place where people are not afraid. He does not wear a white coat because it can make people think of pain. Jerome believes going to the dentist should be relaxing and even fun.
Jerome uses virtual-reality headsets to help people relax. His office was the first in Britain to use them. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while Jerome checks their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth. Many patients like this part of their visit.
The office smells nice, like oranges, not like a usual dentist's office. Jerome says smell is important because the usual dentist smell can make people nervous. The nice smell helps people feel calm.
Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, but he takes his work seriously. He uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth, which is not painful if you are relaxed. Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn new dental techniques. He learned that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for the dentist.
When a patient arrives, Jerome offers them tea and asks what video they want to watch. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,B2,"**Chocolate: A Sweet Story**
Chocolate comes from South America. Now, it is a big business all over the world. In the UK, people spend a lot of money on chocolate, especially at Easter. They also eat a lot of chocolate at Christmas. 
Chocolate is made from cacao beans. The cacao tree grows in warm places like Africa, South America, and Asia. The tree has big fruits with seeds inside. These seeds are cacao beans. When they are dry, we can make chocolate from them. 
A long time ago, the Aztecs used cacao beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water'. The drink had spices and was used for special events. Later, the Spanish added cinnamon and sugar to make it taste better. 
In the 17th century, people in Europe started to drink chocolate. They melted chocolate blocks in hot water. In 1826, a man from the Netherlands made chocolate powder. In 1847, a company in England made the first chocolate bar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.
In the early 1900s, the British company Cadbury made a chocolate bar called Dairy Milk. It became very popular. Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. 
Chocolate companies now make chocolate bars into ice cream, drinks, and desserts to keep people interested. 
Cacao farmers have a hard time because the price of cacao beans went down in the 1980s. Many farmers had to stop working. So, when you eat your next chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and very good at making art with shells. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers, but right now, he loves making beautiful things from shells. He has been doing this for ten years.
Peter shows his shell art in his apartment. He is very excited about his work and does not worry if people find it boring. He is charming, and his art is beautiful. He has shell ornaments above his fireplace. He says he does not mind if people do not buy them because he likes them so much. He did not plan to sell his art, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. Five years ago, he had an exhibition in London, and many pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened, and his art is expensive, with some pieces costing PS2,000.
Peter says he does not set the prices. He believes no one else makes art like his. The gallery owner told him that people will want his art because he will stop making it one day. Peter wishes he started making shell art earlier in life because he could have made even more amazing things. Now, he is older and cannot work as much as before, but his art is still very special.
Peter's art is different from the shell items you find in seaside shops. He makes tiny, detailed boxes, pictures, and flowers from shells. He uses simple materials like cardboard, glue, and washing-up liquid. He says his art just happens naturally, but it is clear he pays a lot of attention to detail.
Peter travels to many places like France, Thailand, and Mexico to find shells. He only collects shells that are empty and does not harm living creatures. He says people walking on the beach break more shells than he collects. He believes his art makes the shells even more beautiful."
FCE_62,B2,"'The Schoolgirl Model Kira Langer is 15 years old. She is a model and sometimes she is on magazine covers. But she is also a student and studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw talks to her. 'Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said. I was worried because I thought models were difficult and not very smart. And now she was late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. Maybe she went to the hairdresser's instead. If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to talk to me. But when Kira came in, she was smiling and said sorry for being late. She was with her mother. Kira wore a simple black dress and trainers, not expensive clothes. She was friendly, tall, and pretty. Models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, Kira explained. Her mother looked like a normal mum and was proud of Kira. Kira is surprised by her fame because it was not planned. Her older sister wanted her to join a model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should try,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos anyway.' When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. Being a finalist made Kira confident, and she did well. She won the competition, and a model agency in London gave her work. Kira now has two lives: school and modeling. Her friends and teachers are proud of her. But some people at school are not nice. 'They say I think too much of myself.' This is hard for Kira because she is not like that. She says, 'They think I changed because I'm a model, but I'm just more confident now.' As a model, her social life is different. The agency can call anytime for a job. 'If my friends go out, I can't always join because I might have work. I can't make plans, but my friends understand.' Kira has a bright future in modeling. Not many people can say that before finishing school. I ask Kira what she would do if she wasn't a model. She thinks and says, 'I'd like to do what you're doing.'"
FCE_49,B2,"Father and son look for gold
Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son team. They have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain has a lot of gold. After ten years of digging, they believe they are close to finding gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 years old and from Liverpool, says they are finding more gold as they dig. They just need to dig a little more to find where the gold is.
The father and son started looking for gold after reading about gold in the 'Dolgellau gold belt' in Wales. They read old mining books and newspapers to find the best place to dig. They spent ten years getting permission to dig, taking earth samples, and cleaning the area. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter hole. Now, they need more money to keep digging. They need someone to give them Â£50,000 to dig a little more and find the gold. Chris Madden says it is hard to find someone to give them money, but they have some people they can ask.
People in the area are talking about the dig. Dolgellau is a town that needs tourists, and people hope the gold will bring more visitors. Peter Woolven, who manages a hotel, says it would be good if more people come, but he hopes not too many people will dig in the hills.
The Welsh gold industry was big in the late 1880s, but now it is not. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, closed a month ago. But some people are still looking for gold. George Hall, another gold seeker, wants to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. Hall, who is 70 years old, says looking for gold is exciting and like finding hidden treasure. He hopes to be lucky this time."
FCE_31,B2,"**IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist. She works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel studies the sea and teaches at Southampton University. She goes underwater in a small steel vehicle, like a small car. She dives three kilometers down to study underwater volcanoes.
Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move much. They stay inside until someone opens the door. A dive lasts 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.
If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. A small escape vessel goes quickly to the surface. It is like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet.
Rachel was nervous the first time she went in the vehicle. She was on a ship with an instructor. He showed her what to do in an emergency. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place near the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was putting equipment there to study a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she is at her office in Southampton. She loves teaching, but she also loves her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of them and looks like black smoke. It is very hot, 350 degrees.
Rachel was scared once when she was with an American team. There was a big explosion. She thought she would die, but they were okay. It was a big relief.
Rachel loves diving to the bottom of the ocean. She feels amazed when she sees the volcanoes. She studied them for three years. Seeing them for real was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired. My mind was tired of different timetables, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. 
I just needed to buy one train ticket. Because I was under 25 years old, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train's movement helps you sleep well. 
When you carry everything in a backpack, you travel simply. You might throw away socks that smell bad or books you finish reading. This is the Inter-Rail way. You don't need to think too much. Just have a ticket in your hand. 
This train ticket lets young people visit many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our camp in France. But we wanted to keep traveling. There was always another country to see. And it didn't cost us more money.
We liked culture, but this was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans and only saw easy-to-reach sights. We wanted to do something different, not follow a tour. I liked seeing the view from the train station. We just wanted to have fun. 
We were like other Inter-Railers. We shared train floors, food, water, money, and music. Traveling is exciting because you see new places. A city feels real when you see it with your own eyes. 
Seeing Europe helps you understand it better. Everyone knows about Europe, but it means more when you see it yourself. Other people's holiday photos are boring because you didn't see the place. 
The train trip is a personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see this. But for us, it took some time to understand."
FCE_37,B2,"'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out your bags are not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a place with a different climate and have the wrong clothes. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to people who travel a lot. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and they cannot promise your bags will be on the same flight, especially if you change planes. 
Airlines ask you to check in early to make sure there is enough time for your bags to get on the plane. The shortest time to change flights is called Minimum Connecting Time (MCT), and it is also longer to help with bag transfers. Usually, this system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause baggage issues. Sometimes, human mistakes or accidents, like a torn label, can happen. These problems are worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. 
For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, and nine million changed planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The chance of losing bags is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers go to Latin America.
To avoid losing your bags, choose direct flights if you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline and allow more time between flights. Label your bags inside and out with your home and holiday addresses and include flight numbers. If your bags still go missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,B2,"'The Kingfisher
Charlie James is a wildlife photographer. He knows a lot about the kingfisher. The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird. It lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. 
Old trees hang over the stream, making some parts dark and some parts light. The main colors are soft greens, browns, and yellows. The kingfisher flies very fast and straight, like a flash of light. It is small but very powerful.
Charlie loved kingfishers from a young age. He does not know exactly why he loves them so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. One story says a kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. 
Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. Their feathers reflect light, so they look blue or green. This is why they can change color when the light changes.
Many photographers love kingfishers. They are shy but can be watched from a hidden place. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket. He waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back and sat very close to him. It took him four years to take a good picture.
Charlie spent a lot of time by streams with kingfishers. He missed school to be with the birds. He did not do well in school, but people noticed his love for kingfishers. At 16, he worked for a nature magazine. Later, he became a wildlife film cameraman. 
Charlie wants to make a film about kingfishers with no talking, just beautiful pictures. He loves the simple beauty of the kingfisher. He likes to take pictures of their wings. Charlie has spent more than half his life with kingfishers, and he still loves them. His photos show his feelings, but there is more to his love for kingfishers than his work can show.'"

Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado in Vienna. She ended up helping him because his assistant was not there. She was not nervous. Anne works with a London opera company. She is also known in other European countries. The British Arts Council helped her with money. She has helped Abbado many times now.
**B. Andrew Constantine**
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying two times before. The competition gave him many chances to perform. He worked with a famous conductor. He hopes people will not only remember him for the competition. The English Chamber Orchestra invited him back after the competition. This is important for his career.
**C. Wasfi Kani**
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She likes the long practice time for opera. She started conducting in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional. She learned a lot from Sian Edwards. Sian was the same size as her, which helped her learn. Wasfi likes the complex nature of opera. There are many arguments and singers to think about.
**D. Roger Vignoles**
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. Conducting was a surprise for him, but he likes it. He was a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano. It was easier than he thought. He knew the music well. People respect him as a musician. He learns from every experience. He will try anything to see what he likes.

Wayne Marshall is 32 years old. In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed him. Wayne soon conducted a musical in London. It was hard at first. Some musicians were not serious. He was firm with them. He gave clear directions. He never studied conducting formally. No book tells you how to conduct. People have been kind to him. He is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,B2,"**Theme Parks in Britain**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to try the best ones.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US. We thought Fun Island might not be as exciting, but we liked it. The park is good for young children, so our three-year-old had fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was great. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay. The park could look nicer, but the staff are very helpful, and it is clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**
We had never been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, with small famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We stayed for six hours and liked the places to rest. The park looks nice, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**
After seven hours, we still had more to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus with a trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and the girls were scared but liked it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The new ride, Fear Factor, was too big for our kids. The park is well designed, and even waiting in line is not boring. It is very clean, and the staff are great. A staff member helped us on a ride.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**
We arrived at 1 p.m. and were sad the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is good for younger kids because the rides are not too scary. I am scared of rides, but I had fun. We loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited 30 minutes for Lightning River, and it was over quickly. I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun. If the kids were older, they might find it boring, but they loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**
The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. The Rocket, Europe's tallest roller-coaster, is very scary. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down, was worse! There are many rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. The staff were sometimes nice, but not always. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't leave early because the kids were having too much fun."

She wanted a job she could do at home. Christine used to work with computers, so her husband suggested starting a computer design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. She is careful with money and tells the bank if she might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evening. Her business is small, and local people come to pick up their work.
**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She studied art and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no jobs like that in the countryside. So, she started her own business and makes 50 different cards. She sells them to museums. Maggy works in a big room at home. She doesn't advertise; people hear about her from others. She is cheaper than other artists, so people send her work from London. She misses talking to other people about ideas, but she likes being independent.
**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner makes curtains. Her business has had good and bad times. She started eight years ago, and her business grew quickly. She used to have six workers, but she had to let them go because the economy got worse. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband and other women who work from their homes. She has to lower her prices sometimes and look for new chances.
**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside because London was too expensive and she loves the country. She likes working when she wants. Most of her money comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. It is hard to stop working sometimes. She publishes children's books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. She felt alone at first because she used to work in London.
**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cake business and a shop. She makes Â£250,000 a year and has six workers. She started at home ten years ago. Meg is interested in health, so she made fruit cakes with good flour and eggs. Friends and family liked them, and soon she was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building for her business. Now, she has a baker, an assistant, and a cake decorator. Meg doesn't bake anymore; she manages the business. The hardest part has been money because she didn't have much to start with."
FCE_1,B2,"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family
The Watkins family is special. The sons, Paul and Huw, are musicians and composers. Their dad, John, makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are from South Wales. When their son Paul was ten, he needed a cello. Cellos were very expensive, so John decided to make one himself. He found a school nearby that taught instrument making. He went to classes once a week for three years. After making some violins and violas, John made his first cello for Paul. It was very good. Later, he made another cello for Paul, which Paul used for many years.
John stopped teaching and now makes violins full-time. He makes about twelve violins a year. He even sold one to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.
Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano, then he wanted to play the cello. He liked the cello player in his dad's music group. Paul learned the cello and became very good. He won a big music competition and played in the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Now, he plays a very old cello from the Royal Academy of Music.
Huw, the younger brother, plays the piano and writes music. He is also doing well in music.
The Watkins family is very busy with music. Paul will be on TV playing the cello, and Huw's music will be played in London. Their parents, John and Hetty, are very proud and support their sons in their music careers."
FCE_53,B2,"Looking after the countryside
THE NATIONAL TRUST
The National Trust is a group that takes care of the countryside in Britain. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust. 
Gareth says a warden needs common sense. He also needs to be good with people because he talks to farmers, visitors, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm. Many people wanted the warden job, but Gareth got it because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he did not have special training.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, so he understands farmers' problems. He is also strong enough to do hard work like building fences and planting trees. Since working with the Trust, Gareth has learned more about taking care of nature. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and now sees how farming has changed the countryside. He says it is not the farmers' fault because they followed government rules.
At first, farmers and people who care about nature did not agree. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's job is to make sure work is done well and cheaply. He likes seeing projects finished, but he also spends time on paperwork.
Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to most people, but some visitors can be rude. He says being nice to them is hard. If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But there might not be a job on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I asked her, 'Don't people look at you strangely?' She said, 'I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don't see much else. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'
Kendra says, 'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships.' She follows a strict plan to be very fit. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries playing. 'We will have support from people at home, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to make netball more popular here. People will expect us to play well.'
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'We have always beaten them, but they are good to play. They have a lot of skill.' The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, with no rest. You only have one chance to win,' says Kendra.
In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. 'You train to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we are all friendly.'
Netball is now more scientific about fitness. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I need a strong mind and must lead by example. I support and encourage my team.'
'From the start, my netball career was planned,' she says. 'I decided this competition would be my last as a player.' She might coach young players in the future, but now she focuses on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'"
FCE_50,B2,"**Specialist Music Schools**
What do you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents might not see their child's talent until the child becomes upset or difficult. Regular schools are good for children who are smart in subjects like math or science, but musically talented children need special help. Regular schools might not have this help, especially if music is not important there.
Specialist music schools can help these children. In Britain, there are five music schools for children aged seven to eighteen. These schools help children become better at music with the help of professional musicians. Children spend a lot of time on music activities like lessons, playing in groups, singing, and learning music theory. They also practice a lot in special rooms. They study important subjects like English and math, but not as many subjects as in regular schools.
These music schools are private, and classes are small. Most children live at the school, which means they stay there all the time. This can be expensive, costing between Â£12,000 and Â£17,000 a year. Schools try to help parents with scholarships if needed. Some parents do not want their young children to live away from home. School directors say they want to help children grow into well-rounded people.
There are some problems. Being away from home can be stressful for young children. Some children might lose interest in music as they grow older. Schools watch the children closely and help them if needed. Some students feel they do not learn enough other subjects. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more.
It might be better to wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves about going to a music school. Children who are good at both music and school subjects might do well in a regular school with a good music program. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges, but this is not possible for families who live far from big cities."

Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. The garden looks nice because of the colors and shapes. The people who lived there before Susan loved gardening. They left many plants for her. Susan also got a gardener named Danny. She says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas. But when she said she wanted to paint the flowers, he understood.
Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. She sometimes paints a group of flowers. Usually, she picks flowers and takes them to her studio. She paints one flower, which can take a few days. Then she adds another flower to the painting. Sometimes, it takes years to finish a painting. Spring and early summer are her busiest times. Tulips and poppies bloom then. Susan finds it interesting to watch flowers change. Tulips, for example, change shape in water. At first, they look boring, but then they twist and turn.
Susan has always liked plants. She studied plants in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers before. She thought they looked fake. She liked wild flowers because they grew in hard places. Now, her garden has plants from faraway places like China. She lets the garden grow freely, like a kind aunt with children. Susan is busy with two art shows. She has a lot of flowers to paint. She hired another gardener to help. But she knows she must work in the garden to stay connected to her art."

Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. She wore a uniform and felt different. People looked up to her. Before the flight, she learned about safety and what to do if someone got sick. On the flight to Paris, she gave out magazines. People stared at her, and she felt shy. On the way back, there were 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. She wished she was back in the gym.
Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. She was worried because she doesn't exercise. She was surprised at how much attention trainers give to one person. In her job, she meets many passengers every day. At lunch, she saw that trainers don't always eat very healthy, but they drink a lot of water. She doesn't want to change her job, but she wants to join a gym and be healthier."

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I love the south of France and visit often. There is a train from Cannes that goes along the coast to Italy. The views of the sea are amazing. It is beautiful in any weather or season. You can also see nice gardens and houses. The people on the train are fun, with tourists and locals enjoying the trip.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have taken many train trips, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to the Kruger National Park. I was too young and stayed with my aunt. My first real train station was London Waterloo, and it amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I love the Blue Train. My husband and I took it on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress. I loved it and now always wear pink. The trip through France and up the Nile was perfect after our wedding.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were writing articles on a world trip and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not fixed, and the driver waited for people. Many people climbed onto the train, even on the roof. At night, the views were like a dream.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
I did not see many trains as a child in Singapore and Cyprus. As a teenager, I made a film in Yorkshire with a railway. The old train line was kept by volunteers. I loved steam trains. We rode the train often, and when I returned last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights!"
FCE_8,B2,"'Do you want to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I wrote a story. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice writing. Selling your writing needs knowledge about the 'writing world'. You must know the market for your writing. The best way is to read a lot. Visit your library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading helps you see what publishers want. Remember, things change. New magazines come, and editors change jobs. Publishers always want new writers. You must give them what they want. If you want to write love stories, find magazines that publish them. Get recent copies and see what stories they like. Know who the readers are. Editors want to please their readers. Writers often ask, 'My story was rejected. Am I wasting my time?' I never say stop trying. But maybe the story is not ready. Many new writers send their work too soon. If you wrote only one story, it might not get published. Success usually comes after many tries. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Write ten or twenty more. Each story will be better. You will feel more like a writer. Don't throw away your stories. Improve them. Don't show your work to others too soon. Remember, every writer gets rejected before they succeed. Do everything to become a better writer. Look for a writing course or join a writers' group. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"
FCE_4,B2,"On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were many people there. The station did not feel nice and clean like usual. 
Old couples with matching bags sat on the benches. Many college students sat on the floor with their bags. A man with grey hair was talking to different people. He looked rich. He wore a nice sweater and a soft coat. 
He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia. Then he asked a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I thought I might like to talk to her. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""No, I am going to New York."" He said, ""Thanks, anyway,"" and moved on.
I was curious now. I heard him ask an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Wilmington."" He did not say anything and moved on. I was going to Philadelphia, but he did not ask me. Maybe he thought I looked unreliable.
He looked worried. He asked a woman reading a book, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Yes, I am."" He asked her for a favor. I pretended to look at my watch, but I was listening. 
The man said his daughter was flying out for a study year abroad. She forgot her passport. She called from the Philadelphia station. He asked the woman to take the passport to his daughter. 
The woman asked, ""Why don't you go yourself?"" He said, ""I can't leave my wife alone. She is in a wheelchair."" 
I thought this was a strange excuse. The man had a padded envelope, not a plain one. It looked stapled shut. I thought, ""Be careful, lady."""
FCE_30,B2,"**Gary and Me**
John Moore owns a restaurant. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef.
I think everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking. My chance was to run a restaurant. When I found out about the restaurant, I went to see it quickly. It was in bad shape, but it was just what I wanted. 
Running the restaurant made me think of my childhood. I remember my mom working in a factory. I was sad because I was alone. So, I wanted to have time for family. My wife took care of the kids and did the money work, while I ran the restaurant. We lived above the restaurant. We always ate meals together. This was good for our kids, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. They talked to our customers from a young age. This helped them a lot.
Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into the bath like a pool and got hurt. When he was older, he worked for pocket money. He did small jobs and by ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend. He had a lot of money at school. He was disciplined. He woke up early, even before me. 
In a family business, everyone helps. It was nice to see Gary helping. Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the adults. Sometimes, he was in charge. He made over a hundred meals. I knew he would work in cooking. When he needed work experience for school, I sent him to a friend's restaurant.
Gary started playing drums and has a band now. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if his music becomes popular. I told Gary, ""If you try to do two things, you might not succeed in either. Focus on one thing."" He understood when I said, ""If you want to succeed, do it by 30. After that, it might be too late.""
Gary went to cooking school at 17. On his first day, he finished his work very fast. He even helped others. We are all surprised by how successful Gary's TV show is. I am very proud of him. I always told him to work hard because nothing is free. He took his chance and worked hard. When you talk to your kids, if they remember even a little, you should be happy. Gary listened to me sometimes, I think."
FCE_7,B2,"Finding a good apartment in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way is to know someone who knows someone leaving a place. But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you don't know anyone. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a place. Dublin was a big unknown for her. She didn't think much about why she was going there. Everyone from her school wanted to leave their small town and see more of the world. Some of her classmates went to nearby towns, but Jo was the only one going to Dublin. 
Jo's mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel because it was safe. Her father hoped it was warm because hostels are often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo didn't know they were talking about her as she looked at an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, ""Own room, own TV, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to her work at the post office and seemed perfect. She hoped it was nice and not too expensive.
There wasn't a long line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" Jo worried it might be too fancy because it had its own TV, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf was leaving and said, ""Desperate place. They're both awful."" Jo kept going up the stairs.
A girl named Nessa, wearing a T-shirt with her name on it, greeted Jo. Nessa didn't like the girl who just left. She said the girl acted snobby. Pauline, the other girl, wore a very colorful shirt and had bright hair. Jo was surprised because Pauline was a punk. Jo introduced herself and said she worked at the post office. Nessa offered Jo a mug of tea. They had mugs with their names on them, and one said ""Other."" Nessa said they would put Jo's name on it if she stayed."
FCE_43,B2,"'Dolphins and Their Problems People love dolphins. We like to see them at the beach, in movies, and on TV. But dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are disappearing. Dolphins are special to us. They are smart, understand our feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas. In the North Sea, many dolphins called harbour porpoises are gone. We think 89,000 are missing. You might think dolphins are safe and protected, but they are not. This could be a big problem for wildlife. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. Striped and common dolphins live far in the sea. We see them in small groups near ships, but we do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are friendly and were seen in places like the Thames River in Britain. Now, they are only in a few places in Scotland and Wales. They have skin injuries, which means they are stressed. It is hard to know why there are fewer dolphins. Overfishing is a big problem. It takes away fish, which dolphins need to eat. Dolphins can also get caught in fishing nets. These nets are hard for dolphins to see. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. They had marks and cuts from nets. Waste in the sea is also bad for dolphins. Poisons like pesticides can build up in their bodies. Mother dolphins can pass these poisons to their babies through milk. One baby dolphin died from poisoned milk. Noise from ships and oil wells is another problem. Dolphins use sound to understand their world. Noise in the sea is louder than in the air and can disturb dolphins. We do not know how this affects them yet.'"
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind and body. It helps you feel good when life is busy and stressful. Exercise is good for you, and there are many reasons to do it.
Exercise makes your muscles strong and changes your body shape. It helps you stand or sit correctly. It stops muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise makes your heart and lungs healthy and helps blood move in your body.
Exercise can also make you feel less sad and tired. It helps you sleep better and feel less stressed. Exercise can help with some health problems too.
There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. But be careful not to train too hard. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are unsure.
Good posture is important. It helps you look and feel better. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up. This helps you stand tall and breathe better.
Stretching your muscles is also important. It makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine. Do it slowly and carefully.
The best exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, a good workout, and cooling down."

Why do film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their comfortable homes for many months? They want to find the perfect picture. Amanda and Owen work in East Africa, in places like the Ngorongoro Crater. It rains a lot there, which makes their work hard. They bought a special tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud. Amanda and Owen make great wildlife films for TV. They made a famous film about leopards. Now, they are filming jackals, another shy animal.
Amanda and Owen travel a lot to film animals. They have been doing this since TV started. I talked to Owen at a safari lodge. He said they sometimes argue, but they quickly make up. They do not have a leader. They both love animals and see them the same way. They sleep in tents and wake up early. They make tea the night before and keep it warm. They eat pre-packed meals. They can be away for up to eight weeks, which can be hard.
Being alone in nature helps them get close to animals. Once, a lioness treated their car like part of her family. Amanda and Owen started working together in 1988. They need four months to make enough film for a 30-minute show. They must write a plan before they start filming. Owen says they work well together because they have the same ideas. They want to make films that show the true spirit of the place and animals. They want people to feel something when they watch their films."

This is a story about a woman in sports. Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra is getting ready for the World Championships next month. She teaches at a school during the day and then trains in a supermarket car park. 
I asked Kendra if people look at her strangely when she trains there. She said she is too focused on her practice to notice. She only sees cars slowing down sometimes.
Kendra wants to be her best for the Championships. This is her fourth time at the World Championships. There will be 27 countries playing, and it will be the biggest one yet. Kendra is happy because they will have support from people in England. 
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. England has always won against Barbados, but Kendra thinks it will be an exciting game. England is ranked fourth in the world, but the Championships will be hard. They have to play every day without rest. 
Kendra has been playing netball for 15 years. The game is now faster and harder. Players are more aggressive, but they are friendly after the game. 
Netball teams now use science to help with fitness. Kendra says it is important to think and train like the best players in the world. As captain, she wants to support and encourage her team.
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided this will be her last competition as a player. She might coach young players in the future. At the opening ceremony, she might feel emotional, but her fans will support her."
FCE_63,B2,"Rachel Mills is a scientist. She studies the sea and teaches at Southampton University. Rachel goes to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is like a small car. She studies underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move much. They stay inside for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to work, and three hours to come back up.
If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vehicle go up fast. It is like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has used it yet, but it might not be fun.
Rachel was nervous the first time she went in the vehicle. She learned what to do in an emergency. Now, she has made six dives. Last year, she went with a Russian team. They went to a place with many underwater volcanoes. The Russian team put some equipment there to study the volcanoes.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office. She loves teaching, but she also loves studying the ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes. They let out water that looks like black smoke. The water is very hot.
Rachel was scared once when she was with an American team. There was a loud bang, and she thought she might die. But nothing happened, and she was very happy to be safe.
Rachel loves diving in the ocean. She feels amazed when she sees the underwater volcanoes. She studied them for three years. Seeing them in real life was an amazing feeling for her."
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. People decide what they think about us in the first few minutes. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement, how fast or slow we talk, and our voice. 
Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard and got her degree. She was confident when she finished school. She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview. On the day of the interview, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She did not change her jacket because she did not want to be late. Mary did not get the job. The Head Teacher thought she did not care about her appearance.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says people who look like they care about themselves will care about their jobs. In an interview, you should look your best. Many people forget this. 
Janet Goodwood worked as an assistant for ten years. She wanted a promotion but did not get an interview. The Director of Personnel said she did not look like a manager. He told her to dress better next time. Janet was surprised because she thought her work was more important than her clothes.
How we move and our gestures are also important in an interview. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message comes from words. 38% comes from our voice, and 55% comes from our facial expressions. If our face and words do not match, people believe our face more. Make sure your words and body language match.
Do not look too desperate for the job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, was very excited when she got a job offer. Her boss saw her excitement and offered her a lower salary. She thinks she could have gotten more money if she stayed calm.
What we say and how we say it is important too. David Artesio, a manager, says to learn about the company before the interview. Talk about something you like about the company. This shows you are interested. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, says to have a few questions ready. Speak in short sentences, not long ones."

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I love sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried to join a professional football team, but I chose running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country and won a medal. I hoped for more attention and sponsorship, but it didn't happen. Training is expensive. I train at home in winter and go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun there, but I must be disciplined. I can't go out with friends before training. My big goal is to go to the next Olympics.
**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing world is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Surfers are serious, and the best waves are early in the morning. So, I can't go to late-night parties. I also like to sleep in, but I can't do that often. It's worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out. Winning also got me a job on a TV surfing show. Now, I'm a bit famous.
**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Sailing with my team is fun. We celebrate wins in a big way. Some people say we act like kids, but we don't look for media attention. Reporters care more about our celebrations than our races. I'm away for eight months a year, so I enjoy being home with friends. I don't want to be a celebrity. I get letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them.
**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to play tennis with the crowd cheering. But sometimes it gets too busy with fans. I like when fans notice me, but my last girlfriend didn't like it. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was hard, but you must be serious in sports. I'm focused on my game now and will enjoy other things after I retire."
FCE_33,B2,"Title: Shopping with Children
Shopping with children can be very hard. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. They ask for sweet cereals, Disney videos, and comics. I can't buy all these things. I feel bad if I say yes, and I feel bad if I say no. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to choose things. I can't win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, mostly on TV. These ads make children want to buy things. Parents find it hard to explain why they can't buy everything. Ads make things look very nice, even if they are not good for you.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Parents care about what their children eat. They have ideas about healthy food, but they are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and saying no to their children.""
TV ads can't tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But ads still try to make people want to buy. This makes shopping with children stressful. Parents have to decide what to buy and what to say no to. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Now, her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy.
Parents sometimes say no to their children but buy treats for themselves. Mike, a father, says, ""We say no to sweets for the kids but buy chocolate for us. It's nice to buy good things, and kids want that too. But I still get annoyed when they ask for things. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to always say the same thing.""
Supermarkets can help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less if their children are not with them, but shopping without kids asking for things might bring more customers."

FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating is very old. People have skated for thousands of years. Long ago, skates were made from animal bones. Later, people in Scandinavia started using iron skates around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was important. 
In the early 1900s, skating was calm and stylish. But in 1924, at the Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie made skating more athletic. This made skating more popular. Today, skating is both beautiful and hard work.
When you start skating, balance and control are very important. You can go faster when you get better. To balance, keep your legs slightly bent and lean a little forward. Relaxing is very important in skating. 
To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point out. Push forward with one foot and make a small move with the other foot. It is not too hard. As you practice, you can make bigger movements.
Learning how to fall is important. Even the best skaters fall. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps you not get hurt. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand.
Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, or speed skating. It is best to learn figure skating first. Most ice rinks have teachers to help you learn. 
Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, do exercises often. Warm up your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees before skating. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps with balance, coordination, and relaxation. It makes your heart and lungs stronger and makes your body stronger. Skating with swimming or jogging is good for health and fitness."

Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard now. I have no time to watch TV or go out with friends. I only do gym and school. I take training one day at a time. When I am very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but not often. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""
**B. Annika's Mother**
Annika showed great talent from a young age. Some parents push their children, but it doesn't work. To perform like Annika, you must want it yourself. People say we gave up a lot, but they don't see what the sport gave us. We love it and what it did for Annika. Before gym, she was shy and hid behind me. Now she has met people from all over the world and is confident.
**C. Sarah Stokes**
Sarah started show-jumping at ten and won the British National Championship. ""It's good my mum and dad like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere. Shows last one to five days. I never get tired of it. I love show-jumping; it's exciting and fun. Even without Mum and Dad, I would do it because I am determined. My goal is to join the British young riders team. I want to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

FCE_29,B2,"Chris Greener was 14 years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""Do you want to be the flagpole?"" because Chris was already very tall. Now, Chris is the tallest man in Britain at 228 cm. 
People in Europe are getting taller by about one centimeter every ten years. More tall people are being born, but this doesn't mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are becoming like our ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Back then, people ate many different foods. Women collected herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants.
About 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Farmers grew wheat, rice, and maize, which now give us most of our food. This diet was not good for our health. People became less healthy and smaller. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. 
Farming spread because it could feed more people than hunting and gathering. But many people were not well-fed. Only recently have countries like Europe, the US, and Japan started eating better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.
This change is good, but it also causes problems. Beds are still the same size as they were in 1860, and there is less leg-room in planes and trains. Clothes makers have to change their sizes too. 
We can't keep growing forever. Scientists think we might stop growing taller at about 193 cm. But, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, people were bigger to stay warm. Now, as the Earth gets warmer, we might get smaller again."
FCE_57,B2,"Title: Studio Audiences
What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a normal part of TV, but many people don't know much about them. We see them on game shows and wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think studio audiences are not very important. Even people who work in TV sometimes don't respect them. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be on TV for a short time. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of backgrounds. TV shows try to get different people for different shows.
Some people like to watch TV at home and don't understand why others go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio when you can watch at home? Some think people go to maybe be seen on TV. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came for a chance to be on TV. Others are curious to see behind the scenes. But many just go because a friend gave them a ticket.
Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers and follow signs to clap or laugh. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""We hope the show is good enough not to need these signs.""
Is being in a studio different from watching TV at home? Claire thinks it's more exciting. Charlotte liked being part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot."" I couldn't see the actors well and watched on a screen instead.
Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was fun and a free night out."
FCE_9,B2,"**Bruce**  
I like places with people, not wild places. When I travel, I like old villages and temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to a village called Lastingham. I liked the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the land felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in a diary. This was my first try at travel writing.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by people who love trains. I always travel first class because it is not much more money. The view is not amazing. The train goes past fields with sheep and a canal. I like when the train goes through back gardens. We can see people doing everyday things like making tea or washing dishes. I like the simple view of fields, sheep, and the sea. It makes me look closely to find something special.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so not many people go there. Some surfers come, but most people like to look at the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and has many shipwrecks. There are walks by the coast and in valleys with trees and flowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is open land, good for hiking. Not many people live or visit there. It is quiet and empty. I found it when I was a student. I visit every year, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much. Having my son makes the visits special. I feel sad he grows up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to feel connected to England. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon, England, at age twelve. I rode my bike around the moors and villages. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you would not return. That place was Glenthorne. It is a dream place, quiet and romantic. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"Title: A Busy Afternoon with Animals
We love animals and have many at home. One day, my daughter called me at work. She found a big snake and asked, ""Can we keep it?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We have a special tank for animals we find.
When I got home, I heard my children shouting, ""Help, Mom!"" I ran to their room. Our cat, Domino, had caught Bianca, a white mouse. Domino ran around the room with the mouse in his mouth. I tried to catch Domino but fell on the floor. Then, I saw the snake escaping from its tank.
The room was crazy with the cat, mouse, kids, and snake. The dog was barking too. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and came back. I caught Domino and saved the mouse. The mouse was okay.
Next, I had to catch the snake. I sat on the floor and waited. Slowly, the snake calmed down. I picked it up and took it to the garden. I wanted the snake to go to a tree, but it climbed on my shoulders instead. My oldest child, DJ, said, ""Mom, you're warm, and the shed isn't.""
We all helped the snake move to the tree. It finally went up the wall and over the roof. As the snake left, my little child, Clay, said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"'Write me a letter! Today, we use phones, fax machines, and computers a lot. Because of this, writing letters is not as common anymore. But I think getting a letter is special. It is exciting to see a letter arrive, to know who sent it, and to read it. I have been writing letters for a long time. I started with small notes to my mother. She always told me to write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study in London, I wrote letters every week to my mother, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote too, and his letters were funny and long. The letters from home talked about everyday things. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more. I also got letters from boyfriends. They were often far away, so we wrote letters to stay in touch. Writing letters made our relationships better. I could say things in writing that were hard to say in person. I like letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but a letter with lots of news is better! I love getting letters from other countries. I have a friend in Sri Lanka, one in Australia, and another in Vancouver. I also have a friend in France. We met by chance, and now we write to each other. I practice my French with her letters. We have visited each otherâ€™s homes. My biggest letter-writing success was meeting my American penfriend in Texas. We wrote letters for 29 years before we met. People were surprised that we wrote for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about us. I am happy my children also write letters. Like my mother, I tell them to write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas. I think it is important to keep writing letters. It should not become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,B2,"Title: Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art in France
In France, there are very old pictures on rocks in the French Alps. These pictures are 4,000 years old and show cows, fields, and gods. Many people visit this place, but some tourists are damaging the pictures. They write on the rocks and even take pieces home. 
Jean Clottes, an expert, says if this continues, the pictures will be gone in 50 years. Some people rub the pictures to see them better, which also damages them. Others scratch their own names on the rocks.
Experts have different ideas on how to protect the pictures. Henry de Lumley thinks the mountain should be closed to visitors, except for guided tours. But Jean Clottes and David Lavergne think this is too strict. They want people to see the site but worry about money to pay for guards.
Annie Echassoux is worried because more tourists can now reach the site easily. She thinks the area should be closed off with ropes and have guides. She says money must be found to protect the pictures for future generations."
FCE_32,B2,"Title: Shopping with Children
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. They ask for sweet cereals, Disney videos, and comics. I can't buy all these things. If I say yes, I feel bad for buying unhealthy things. But if I say no, I feel bad too. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to choose things.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. Companies spend a lot of money on ads for children, mostly on TV. This makes children want to buy things. Parents find it hard to explain why they can't buy everything. Ads make products look very good, even if they are not healthy.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Parents care about what their children eat. They have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and saying no to their children.""
TV ads cannot tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But ads still try to make children want to buy products. This makes shopping stressful for parents. They have to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Now, her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy.
Parents sometimes say no to their children but buy treats for themselves. Mike, a father, says, ""We say no to sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and children want that too. But I still get annoyed when they ask for things. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to always say the same thing.""
Supermarkets can help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less if their children are not with them, but shopping without children's demands could bring more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"Climbing Walls
In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, inside or outside. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. The event is at the National Indoor Arena, which is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both have a big wall for climbing.
Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they climbed in cold places like Scotland. But climbers needed to stay fit all year. So, they started using brick or stone buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong.
Soon, sports centers began building special climbing walls. These walls used bricks with special edges. Don Robinson, a teacher, made a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete blocks for the wall. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s. But these walls had problems. They were only straight up and down, unlike real cliffs with different shapes. Also, once built, they couldn't change, so climbers got bored.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material for climbing holds. These could be put on any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also made panels with steel frames. These were lighter than concrete and could be set up anywhere. The new system gave climbers many new holds to try."
FCE_61,B2,"'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they might say it is a ""risky"" job. Acting is a risky job because there are many actors, but not many jobs for them. Some friends might say you are crazy, but others might think differently. Everyone will give you different advice. It is your choice, and you must be responsible for it. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee you will get a job after training. You need luck and talent. People want new faces and talent, and acting can be exciting and glamorous. Sometimes, it can also be rewarding. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. It is also about courage and belief in what you do. Why do people want to act? It is hard to say. In the theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is why actors love to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and others' skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job. Disappointment is hard for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes, or waitressing. Then, you might get an audition, but you might not get the job. Actors do not like to talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. From the start, you must be ready for rejection. You say you are available, willing, and hopefully talented. It is up to you. If you do not care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

People in Europe are getting taller. Every ten years, the average height grows by one centimeter. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are becoming like our ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Back then, people ate many different foods. Women collected herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants.

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are using a childhood game to make money. They live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They play a game called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family loved playing it on weekends and holidays.
The game board was made from old wooden boxes. When Dave saw the board was old and broken, he made a new one. It looked very nice. A family member and a friend wanted one too. The brothers took the game to a bar in Santa Fe. At first, people laughed at the game, but then they loved it and couldn't stop playing.
Dave learned that pichenotte is like a game from India called 'carroms'. It changed over time and came to Canada with British people. In Quebec, it became pichenotte. The game is for 2 to 4 players. Each player has 12 pieces to flick into a hole for points. The game is quick, lasting about two minutes.
The game became popular in Santa Fe. The brothers made more boards and sold them at markets. They even started a championship with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers decided to make them full-time. They work in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, costs $595, and is sold on their website.
There are no famous pichenotte players yet, but the brothers hope the game will make them rich. For now, they enjoy playing and making the boards."

When you come to the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land with lots of bushes. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with help from his wife, worked very hard to make it beautiful. They moved a lot of soil and clay to make the land look nice. Machines helped, but there was also a lot of hard work by hand. They brought in a lot of good soil to make grass, flowers, and rocks.
Many trees and plants were put in the village. They had to choose plants that could live near the sea and in strong winter winds. Most plants came from nearby, but some came from far places like Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims thought of the Model Village. He made over 100 models in nine years. The village opened in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, wood, and plastic to last in all weather. Colin learned from experts about how to make the models strong. He became very good at it.
The models are all the same size compared to real life, and they have a lot of detail. The Model Village is very popular because it looks real and is well cared for. The way Colin made the models is now used in other model villages in England and taught in some schools.
The buildings in the village look like traditional British buildings. One special building is the Manor House, which looks like a 13th-century house with stone walls and a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course.
Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models. If you fall, it can take a long time to fix the models. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs can come if they are on a short lead. 
There are buttons in front of some models. Press them to make the models move. At the end of your visit, please tell us what you think. We are always making new models and want to know your ideas. We also want to know if any models need fixing. 
We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village."
FCE_69,B2,"Week after week, British newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules that newspaper editors should follow. Sometimes pop stars let photographers take their pictures, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people because they show private moments. 
There is a group called the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that can help with these problems, but not many people ask for their help. These pictures do not help the public. For example, a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony does not help anyone. The actress was upset about these pictures because a hotel is a private place. She could have complained, but she did not. The PCC did not investigate, which is surprising. 
The PCC could stop newspapers from publishing these pictures. If they did, newspapers might stop showing them. Photographers might also stop taking these pictures because it would not be worth it. But if the PCC tried to do this, there would be problems. How would they decide which pictures to investigate? Should they ask the person in the picture to complain? 
Also, famous people might think the PCC will help them every time, and be upset if they don't. The PCC would have too much work because there are many newspapers and magazines. Some people might not want an investigation because it could be embarrassing. They might just want to forget about it and move on. 
Sometimes, people do not complain because they have other secrets they want to keep. They worry that if they complain, more secrets will come out. 
One British comedian had his privacy invaded when he was on his honeymoon and again on a family holiday. He did not complain because he was afraid the newspaper would make fun of him. People are scared to challenge newspapers because they think they will be targeted again.

B. Michaela
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and acted too strong. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too hard, I save some tasks for the next day. When things are difficult, I tell myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to stop being afraid.
C. Lisa
People think I am confident, but I get scared. In TV, you must look confident. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous. My mom told me, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone worries about themselves."" I remember this. You get confidence by doing things that scare you. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt less scared.
D. Barbara
I enjoy my work, which makes me confident. I learned from my mistakes and became more confident. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let it bother me. You must like yourself. My company has training courses that help my confidence. Setting small goals helps me see my progress.

After college, I worked as a secretary. I was scared to speak in meetings. I finally started speaking up. In politics, I was nervous to speak in public. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing notes helped me feel better. Everyone gets nervous speaking in public. Confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,B2,"'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. 'You can keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He showed me a pile of beautiful kites at his feet. All were 120cm wide and long, made of paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, Malaysia. We watched the big kite festival. In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms. Helpers held the kites, and people waited to fly them. When the whistle blew, the kites went up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person had four kites to be judged on decoration, how well they fly, and how stable they are in the air. 'Flying kites is easy,' said Adnan, 'but making them is hard. Come to my house, and I'll show you.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to fix his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I drove to the southern part of the state, towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with thick rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. I saw a sign that said: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' The path was steep and slippery. When I got there, a man named Baba was waiting with tea. He took care of a kitchen and bamboo huts. I stayed there, trying not to think about insects. The night was very dark and noisy. A waterfall was nearby, and many animals made sounds.

The Gallery has a new painting by Jan van Os, a Dutch artist from the 18th century. The painting shows flowers and fruit in bright colors. It is big (89.1 cm x 71 cm) and painted on wood. The artist signed it in 1777 and 1778 because he painted flowers from different seasons. Miss Violet Churchman gave this picture to the Gallery in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. You can see it in Room 25.
**Special Exhibition**  
A new exhibition called 'Painting in Spain during the late 18th century' started on 15 March in the Sunley Room. The Gallery has new paintings by three Spanish artists: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. Other artists in the exhibition are Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition is open until 31 May.

PET_24,B1,"'Little Chefs
Every Saturday, a group of children aged ten to fifteen learn how to cook. The cooking classes are very popular, and 30 children are waiting to join. Parents pay Â£280 for the course. Children have fun and learn to make good food. 
Bill, who is ten years old, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.'
Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, 'I love cooking. I cooked a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum said I should find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't sure at first. But now, I'm happy I came.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children listen and remember better than adults, but the kitchen is not always tidy when they cook! Adults always learn more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they can cook for themselves when they grow up and leave home.''"

But money is just paper or metal. Long ago, people did not have money. There were no banks or shops. People traded things. For example, a farmer gave corn to get honey from another person.

Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University. He made sure Hypatia got the best education. This was special because most women could not study much at that time. Hypatia studied in Athens and Rome. Then she went back to Alexandria to teach mathematics. She became famous for her new ideas. We do not have her books now, but we know she wrote important math books. Hypatia also liked technology and made some scientific tools. At that time, many rulers were scared of science, and people who did science were in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked and killed in the street.'"

PET_27,B1,"Grass
Grass is a very successful plant. There are more than 9,000 types of grass. Grass grows everywhere in the world. It can even grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Many animals live in grasslands. Small insects, birds, big animals like cows, and lions all need grass. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. New leaves grow from under the soil, not from the top. This helps many animals live in one place. When animals eat the grass, it grows back fast, so they always have food."
PET_44,B1,"Kal Kaur Rai loves fashion. She won the Young Achiever of the Year award at the Asian Business Awards. As a child, she liked drawing clothes. Her parents own a supermarket, and she didn't tell them she wanted to work in fashion. They thought she would do a different job, so she studied management at university. After university, she moved to London and worked in advertising. She needed nice clothes for work events but couldn't buy expensive ones, so she made her own skirts and tops. Her friends liked them and asked her to make clothes for them too. A small shop in London sold her clothes, and they were very popular. This made her happy, so she left her job, got a loan of PS20,000, and started her own clothing brand. Her parents were not upset and said they would help her, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are in over 70 stores, and her business makes over PS500,000. Her clothes are in fashion magazines, and she designs for pop stars. Winning the award made her feel proud.

It takes about 20 minutes by bus to get to the town center. Buses to other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Do not take buses with a blue sign that says ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is an underground station less than 100 meters away.

He called them, and soon Bo was back home safely."
PET_49,B1,"The Ghan Train
Mark Ottaway took a train trip from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cold south. People call it the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. 
In the 1920s, they started a train line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but there was a lot of flooding, so trains had trouble passing. A new line was finished a few months before Mark's trip. The train is not very fast, and most people on it are on holiday. The Ghan is not as fancy as the Orient Express, but the food on the train is very good. 
The railway was first built to carry goods, not people. They thought it would be faster and cheaper to send goods from Europe to the south of Australia through Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent. The Ghan says it is the first train to go from north to south across a continent.
When Mark waited to get on the Ghan, everyone was excited about the trip. Most of the other travelers were older Australians. The first stop was Katherine, where the train stopped for four hours. Some people took a boat trip there. Mark got off the train at Alice Springs and went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. They walked around the rock and watched the sunset.
From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop their trip there. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. On the third day, at dawn, they reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's journey was over. The train did not do everything the ads said, but it took him to some of the most amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,B1,"Climbing to the Top of Britain
Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is very cold there because it is in the north. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was his first big winter climb. They climbed up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high and is the longest climb in Britain. They planned to camp for three days in places called 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. They carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for their boots. These spikes are important because the snow is very hard, like ice. Even though some people in the group were very experienced, they took a lot of safety equipment, like lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but they still felt nervous. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard. The path went up quickly, and Keith's legs felt tired. He was the weakest in the group, so he had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to wait for him, but when he reached them, they started again. Keith promised himself to train better next time. After climbing 200 meters, they reached Tower Ridge, which would take them to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops down hundreds of meters on each side. They had to stay calm and focus on each step. After seven hours, they reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But they were not lucky because there was mist. Going back down to camp can be as hard as climbing up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn can lead to dangerous slopes. Keith was happy they took turns reading the map. He only felt happy about the climb when he was safe in the tent. But he was glad he made it to the top."
PET_58,B1,"Anna's New School
This week is very exciting because we moved to a new school building! The building is made of wood, like our old school. It is special because it is good for the environment. It took a long time to build, and we watched it happen. It was fun to see, but some nice land is gone now. The building machines were very loud, and sometimes they stopped because of rain. We thought the school would never be ready.
Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the ones in our old school. We also have a room for people in the town to have meetings. There is a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We will use the changing rooms when our new sports field is ready.
When you come into the school, you see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us, the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside. When we sing, it sounds like a concert hall!
There is a tree on the roof of the school. The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We saw it yesterday with our teacher. It moves very fast and is very big. We took pictures to put on the website.
We are using the new school, but some parts are not finished yet. We are doing a play for parents, but we have to go back to the old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn faster here!"

I looked down at the river below and understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place to stay wasn't great, but we had what we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, and sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places, and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we didn't know exactly what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock climbing. Then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we were out at last. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we did.'"

PET_53,B1,"'Joining the Kirov Ballet
Hello, I'm Nathalie. Last year, I joined the Kirov Ballet School in St Petersburg, Russia. I was one of the youngest foreign students there. At my first ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn't know anyone. The other students asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they spoke English, so we could talk. Now, after six months, everyone is nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers.
When I first arrived, my mum stayed with me for two weeks. I was a bit sad when she left. One night, I called her because I felt lonely. The ballet classes in Russia are harder than in England. I eat a lot to have energy for the classes. This helps me perform well. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the film ends.
Now, I feel at home here. I like walking in the city and visiting shops, even in December when it was very cold. It was minus 10Â°C, so I bought a fur hat. The Russians said it was not very cold for that time of year! My room is warm and cozy.
We are preparing for a new ballet show, and there is a competition for young dancers. I will join the competition. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,B1,"**THE ICEHOTEL**
The Arctic is a place where the sun does not set in summer. Many people visit in summer, but in winter, it was mostly empty. In the late 1980s, people thought winter could be special too. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit opened an art show in an igloo (a house made of snow) in Jukkasjarvi, a small town on the Torne River. This place was called Arctic Hall, and many people came to see it. One night, some visitors decided to sleep there. They liked it, and this gave the idea to make an ice hotel. Now, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world.
Every winter, builders, architects, and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They start in December, and the hotel is ready by January 7th. The hotel is made of snow and ice, so it melts in spring when it gets warm. Inside the hotel, it is always between -5Â°C and -8Â°C, even if it is colder outside. Guests get warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves. It is also good to bring sweaters, a scarf, and thick socks. You can buy these on the ICEHOTEL website and they will be in your room when you arrive.
The ICEHOTEL is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle. It is 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the hotel."

There were special offers, like a leather sofa for Â£45 until 3 am and a bed for Â£30 from 3 am to 8 am. The shop's normal hours are 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours on the first day. However, it closed after 30 minutes. A police officer said: 'We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would sell out. They did not want to wait in line. Also, many cars were trying to get to the car park. Some people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: 'I waited for three hours but did not have time to buy anything. The staff were calm and explained the situation. It was not safe, so they had to close. I will come back when they open again, but I will not wait in line.'"

In 2003, Tanya Streeter became famous because she dived 120 meters deep and came back up without help. She held her breath for over three and a half minutes. This made her the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive to make sure she was safe. Some people think free-diving is dangerous, but Tanya says it is safe if you train well and have good safety. Tanya trains a lot. She spends most of her time training in the gym. She also trains in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. When she practices diving, she goes away from home. She does fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day after each dive. Rest is important so she does not get too tired. When Tanya is not diving, she talks to people about sports and helps with environmental projects. She grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman and loved swimming and exploring the sea. Tanya says her life now is like her childhood dreams. She is famous in some countries, so people listen to her about the environment.

The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for kids and too simple for adults. Directors learned from this, and film companies started making a lot of money again."
PET_26,B1,"Title: Caroline Benson's First TV Role
Caroline Benson is a new TV star. She talks about her first TV role. 
Caroline did not think she would film a TV show in her first year at university. She had only acted in school plays before. She loved the book ""The Finnegans"" since she was eleven. Her grandmother said she was like Polly Finnegan, a character in the book. Caroline always wanted to play Polly.
Before university, Caroline took a year off to travel. While in Chile, her mother emailed her. The email said there were plans to make the book into a TV show. Caroline wanted to try for the role. Her mother sent her photo to the director and asked him to meet Caroline. Caroline flew back and got the role.
Filming started a week after university began. Caroline got permission to be away for three weeks. When she returned to university, she woke up at 6:00 am to write essays. She did not tell her university friends about the TV show, but they found out and were happy for her.
Caroline says it was an amazing experience. She wants to be an actress after university. Her family is not in acting, but her grandfather was an opera singer. She tried for other TV roles but has not received any offers yet. Caroline had a busy social life too. When filming ended, she did not know what to do. She acted in two college plays after that.
Caroline has not been home much. Now her first year at university is over. She is going to Greece for the summer with friends."

Since we started, I have learned many things. I share these lessons in this book because I think we have important ideas about running a business. This book is not a typical business book, and it is not just about my life. The main idea is that to do well in business, you need to be different. Business can be fun, it can be run with love, and it can help people. In business and in life, I want to have fun, feel like a family, and enjoy surprises. I want the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. This book shares my ideas with everyone. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' and what we can do.

PET_30,B1,"HONEY
Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It has water and sugars. Bees travel very far and visit many flowers to make honey. They can travel 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers. There are more than 300 types of honey. Light-colored honey is usually milder in taste than dark honey. 
A long time ago, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians thought honey was very valuable and used it as money. Today, people make and eat honey all over the world. Research says honey can help with tiredness and make athletes perform better. Honey is not just food; it can help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,B1,"Norwich is a city in East Anglia, a part of Britain. People have lived there for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By 1066, it was one of the biggest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it important for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city with a Royal Charter, which means it could govern itself.
Today, Norwich is smaller than London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second biggest city in England. It grew for 300 years and became rich, known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built there. Norwich has many things to do, like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centers. It also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors.
Norwich has a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. Builders made a big hole in the city for over two years to build it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof with water pools and trees. People in Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping center. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new things."
PET_43,B1,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**
Every autumn, the sky in Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, is full of bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. It is a big event that lasts nine days every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate a local radio station's 50th birthday. Back then, there were only about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a parking lot in the city. Now, the festival is much bigger. This year, about a thousand balloons from many countries will come to the festival.
**What to See**
The balloon pilots talk to each other using radios. They light up their balloons at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow.' It is a great time to take photos. You need to come just after it gets dark or before 5:30 am to see the balloons glow in the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are different sizes and colors. Some look like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it.
In the afternoon, you can go on a balloon ride over the desert. Many companies offer these rides. You can also take a cable car ride to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride in the world, and you can see the festival from high up. There are many other fun things to do, like watching balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.
**The Albuquerque Box**
This is a special wind pattern that is great for flying balloons. The Sandia Mountains keep the balloons safe from strong winds. The mountains also make gentle winds at different heights. This helps skilled pilots control where their balloons go.
**Practical Advice**
Buy your tickets online before you go to the festival. This will save you time. Wear layers of clothes because it can be cold at night and in the morning, but you will need sunglasses and sunscreen during the day. Bring a flashlight for night events and a camera for pictures. If you use a film camera, bring high-speed film for night photos."

The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is a very popular place for tourists to visit in the UK. When you see it, the big 'biospheres' look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. This shows how important plants are to people. Many things we use every day come from plants, like wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. There are over 135,000 different types of plants here. Even if it is cold outside, electric heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. Another zone is like the weather in the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. They also plan to make a desert zone soon."

PET_14,B1,"'Learning the Violin'
""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when you are learning about the world."" Margaret lives in London and likes to teach children who are three or four years old. But she also teaches some five-year-olds who really want to learn.
Margaret started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first class was with her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson is one hour long, every two weeks. Each student also has one lesson alone with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons.
At first, students learn to play by listening. They do not read music until they have been playing for a few years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret says her way of teaching is not to make great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and learn the violin in a more traditional way."

Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar. He replaced Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer. The first song on the CD is a dance song. This shows the band is not only making slow songs now. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder. Most of the other songs are slow, like their usual style. These two dance songs might surprise many fans. They are very good and could become popular. The singer, Rob Letchford, sings very well on this CD. He recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. People who bought tickets do not need to worry. The concerts will happen later when Rob is better. On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles. Some songs are slow, and some are fast. I think the best songs are at the beginning of the CD. The last songs are not as good. Even so, 'Here Again' will be a big success for the band."

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, but it was found by people traveling on land, not by sea. 
In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to look for gold. But the people who got rich were not the ones looking for gold. The richest people made money by owning banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.
Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were the same and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be made by hand. Now, most shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines helped make many shoes quickly and cheaply for more people.'"

PET_40,B1,"**The History of the Iditarod - The Last Great Race on Earth**
In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the most northern state in the USA. Many people went there to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew very fast and became the biggest city in Alaska for a short time.
In summer, boats could bring important things to these towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, so boats could not come. In 1910, a winter path was made for dogs to pull sleds. The dogs carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for the dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at places called 'roadhouses' to rest and eat.
The trail was used every winter until the 1920s. Then, airplanes started to be used instead of dog teams. But in 1925, a disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was far away in Anchorage. Airplanes were new, and people were not sure if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot was not there, so they used dog teams to bring the medicine.
The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams six days to finish the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a man from Norway, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. Balto saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.
Today, there is a dog sled race every year from Anchorage to Nome. It follows the same path as the 1925 journey. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

Some players even made new music on stage. It was fun to watch, and I loved playing on stage with my band!
Our school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to play get in. But anyone who wants to play can come to practice before school. We also spend time after school listening to jazz and learning about it. We go to jazz summer camps too. I have been to a few and learned a lot.
Adults are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher says pop music is not hard enough for people who are serious about music. I like jazz because it is new and old at the same time. You can make your own music and feel like you are part of jazz history. 
My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who help us. Without them, we couldn't do well with our music!"

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, 'I love cooking. I cooked a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum said I should find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't sure at first. But now, I'm happy I came.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children listen and remember better than adults, but the kitchen is not always tidy when they cook! Adults always learn more about food.

Ice can be under the melting snow and can make you go off the road. The car coming towards you might slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick movements can make the car hard to control. So when you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you do not spill it. Rule Number Two is to watch what might happen. The more ice there is, the further you need to look down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"

In his late twenties, he got money from the Italian government to study art. He liked early Italian artists, and this shows in his work. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark, but he says he never knows how it will look in the end. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself.' Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can use colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors go next to each other.' He does not draw before painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. He changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes models who do not ask to see their pictures while he is painting them. 'If they want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he just paints the way he can. His work still influences young British painters."

'Okay,' we said, 'but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are hard to move, Ben's band friends came to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for a few hours each week, the house is loud with their music and singing.

I decided to go to university after 14 years away from school. I was a secretary and made good money, but I was bored because I did not have to think much. I felt sad because I thought I would stay in that job forever. I saw students at the local university who looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be like them. Now, as a student, it is hard to make friends with younger students. They think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because they know more than me, even though we are the same age. But I am happy to study because I need a qualification to get a good job. I like reading books on the weekend more than going to parties. I also enjoy student benefits like long holidays and discounts at the theatre and cinema. Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good choice.'"
PET_48,B1,"Henry Ford
Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cheap cars for people to buy. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. He soon sold 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but there was not much choice. Henry Ford said about the Model T, 'You can have any color you like, as long as it's black.'"

KET_13,A2,"CANADA GEESE
Canada Geese are big birds with blue and white colors. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to a warmer place. It is too cold in Canada during winter, and the birds can die if they stay.
Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds won't know what to do in autumn."" Bill had a small airplane, and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he took short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him.
When it got cold in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States. It is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home.
This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They did not come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks but could not find them. When he got back home, Bill saw the geese waiting for him. They found their way home without him!"

Each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they do not get too hot. 
Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at markets. But it was summer and too hot, so people did not want sweaters. Then, she made socks. Everyone liked the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started. 
At first, Jenny made the socks at home. But soon, she had many customers. She had to send the wool to a factory. Now, machines make all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walking, sports, and skiing. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favorite gift.

KET_10,A2,"'BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON Most house break-ins happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house break-ins have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of break-ins happen when people leave a door or window open. Night-time break-ins are rare because families are usually at home. But winter afternoons are good for burglars because it is dark, and they can't be seen easily. Many houses are empty then because people are still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This help is free.''"

KET_44,A2,"'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit to eat. This meant people moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming let people stay in one place, and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages could do other work, like making clothes, because farmers grew food for everyone. But farming was hard when the weather was bad, and some people did not have enough food. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels very far to our homes.'"

'Bollywood' is the name of the movie industry in Mumbai, India. Bollywood makes almost 1,000 movies every year. Since 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 movies. This is more than the USA, so it is the biggest movie industry in the world. Most people in India like watching movies more than any other activity. Ten million people in India go to the cinema every day. Bollywood movies are about love stories, and they always have singing and dancing. People outside India also like Indian movies. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling movies to other countries. Indian actors make more movies each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they do not get paid as much. This is why most Bollywood movies only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood movie costs at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is different. Some people say he is India's greatest actor. He has been in more than 140 movies in almost 40 years."

KET_4,A2,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**
Today, there are police everywhere. But in 1700, London had no police. Only a few old men watched the streets at night, and they did not get much money. 
About 300 years ago, London started to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who took money in the streets. People stayed at home because of this.
In 1750, Henry Fielding paid some people to stop the thieves. They were like police and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. 
Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners. But London was very big and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force started with 3000 officers. Most of them walked, but some rode horses.
Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police get good pay. Police who ride horses get even better pay."

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will find Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake turns to ice. Every weekend, many Canadian fishermen go there. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. They sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice.
Bob Marvisch has come here every year for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, some thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then, you put the line through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I like to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I caught twenty-five! It's a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"""

Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of big white cards. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its card. Sometimes, the keepers gave the elephants new brushes with paint and took the old ones away. Slowly, the elephants painted pictures on the cards, following their keepers' instructions. I was amazed! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one.

How are you? I am happy because I have a new job in the city center. I work in a Tourist Information Office. It is very interesting. I start work every morning at 7:30, so I get up very early! I love this job because I meet people from many different countries. I like telling them about our city. Here is a photo of me. I am wearing my new uniform. Do you like it?
Love,

KET_20,A2,"'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometers an hour. This makes it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens. They take about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.'"
KET_40,A2,"Victoria Jamieson is from Britain. She started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. Now, she is 23 and has won many snowboarding competitions. We talked to her last week in Switzerland at a snowboarding competition. We asked her why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I like all sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding was a natural choice. It is easy to learn, and you can get good in a few months.""
We asked if she practices a lot. She said, ""In winter, I snowboard every day in the mountains from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love doing all these activities! I enjoy competitions and being in the mountains because they are beautiful. But I love free-riding the most. Free-riding is snowboarding for fun, not in a competition.""
We asked her what is important when learning snowboarding. She said, ""You can learn fast, but you need lessons. It is also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because you fall down a lot at first!"""

KET_64,A2,"Mount Kilimanjaro
Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. People say the Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and it can be very cold, below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,A2,"'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. Otters usually come out at night. They are very good at swimming and can swim more than 10 kilometers an hour. Otters have thick brown hair to keep them warm in the water. They can close their ears and nose, so they can stay underwater for a few minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were dirty, and many fish and insects died. The otters had no food. But now, the rivers are clean again, and there is lots of food for otters.'"

KET_42,A2,"Dear David, I will visit your country next month. I will travel with two friends. We don't know where to stay. Are there any cheap hotels in your town? We want to stay in the center. Can you help us? Carlos Dear Carlos, Hotels in the center are expensive, but I have good news. I talked to my aunt Gloria about you. She says you can all stay at her house. Her house has more bedrooms than my house! Is that okay with you? David"
KET_59,A2,"'Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We use museums to keep beautiful things safe. Many people help to make a building. The architect plans how the building will look and draws pictures. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a nice roof. It looks beautiful from every side. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a famous roof. It looks like a glass tent.'"

KET_32,A2,"'The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England. They are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a big picture of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the village next to him is called Cerne. Nobody knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but it was a long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to see the picture. If you go on the first of May when the sun comes up, you will see people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.'"
KET_61,A2,"Gail Rollins
Gail Rollins is a very good runner from Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run 10,000 meters and maybe 5,000 meters at the European Championships. Before, Gail often came second in big races. But she was always happy and smiling, and people in her city like her for this. 
In 2004, things changed for Gail. She ran her first half-marathon, which is a long race. She won and had the fastest time of the year for a British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also ran when he was young. But he stopped because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes runs with Gail. But it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him.
Gail trains hard. She runs long in the morning and fast in the afternoon. But she rests on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time."" Sometimes he asks, ""Are you sure you should eat that?"" It is usually about cakes, but Gail can eat almost everything."

KET_28,A2,"Bill Prince-Smith Bill Prince-Smith did many jobs before he started writing children's books at 60 years old. He was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist. Now, 13 years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he writes in his office. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. His ten grandchildren do not live close, but they also read his stories and say if they are good or bad. This helps Bill know what young children like to read. Bill writes about life in his village and the farms nearby. His favorite book is his fifth one: The Sheepdog. It is about a farmer and his dog. 'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are very smart. They learn fast.' Last year, The Sheepdog became a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used new computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes film-makers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film,' he says."
KET_35,A2,"'POSTCARDS Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. Postcards have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday. Postcards are cheap, and the pictures are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed pictures of news events, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures then.'"
KET_5,A2,"'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur. Dinosaurs died about 60 million years ago, long before people lived on Earth. We do not know why they all died. Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest dinosaurs were the largest animals to live on land. The Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs.'"
KET_41,A2,"'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Big bears are very strong and can hurt people. Bears can climb trees and run fast. But they do not see well. They use their noses to find food. There are seven kinds of bears. The biggest is the white polar bear. It is almost three meters tall. There are two kinds of black bears. One lives in North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black. They can be dark brown or reddish brown. Many people love the black and white panda bear from China. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard to find food.'"
KET_38,A2,"CROCODILES
Crocodiles live in warm places in the world, like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They like to stay in slow water, but they can move fast in water and on land. You can see many crocodiles together in big groups. They eat many things they catch, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they eat big animals or even people. There are more than ten kinds of crocodiles. All crocodiles have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but they grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles can live for a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo was 66 years old."
KET_17,A2,"'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon to carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers made the first plane with an engine and flew it. This happened in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, planes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by plane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,A2,"'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people got cold and wet if it rained. The queen liked going to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to watch plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. People in the audience ate, talked, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the 1600s.'"
KET_48,A2,"Dear Jeff,
I am having a nice holiday in Australia. When we came here two weeks ago, the weather was bad and cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week we are in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is warm, and I love swimming there. The fish are different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We do not want to come home!
See you at the end of September.
