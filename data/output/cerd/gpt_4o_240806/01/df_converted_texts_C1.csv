CPE_15,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy, but it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common practice. Rubbish bags or bins are regularly collected by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this process strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces little. However, disposing of rubbish is not free. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities have to pay more for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The obvious solution is to charge households for the waste they produce. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming there are places to recycle. 

However, American economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per bag, the number of bags fell by 37%. But this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a method known as the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs, only fell by 14%. In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying, which might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, as people chose to recycle for free rather than pay for rubbish collection. However, this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling voluntarily. In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is lower than other studies, but not surprising. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In wealthier towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 

Should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and the results are not always pleasant."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Today, just being successful in your career isn't enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous people often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to consider how your work affects you personally, including your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your job makes you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then status or money won't make up for your lack as a person.

I am exploring how work can focus on fulfilling personal aspirations, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also offer a meaningful lifestyle, help discover hidden talents, and provide diverse human interactions. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment is the only goal. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even traditional middle-class jobs are losing their appeal. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Companies and public institutions are downsizing, and strategies like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and create courage. Now, I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts work on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is more than a place to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations where people from around the world meet but often don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they have limited interaction with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the skills of the students they employ, rather than just giving them basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's ambitions, they would see many new services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit this by focusing on profit.

It's time to rethink what work means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. Work is a relationship. As people seek independence and personal expression at work, they should have the chance to design their jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical and profitable limits. This requires communicating beyond professional jargon and engaging in meaningful conversations. True conversation is more than just communication; it's an intimate exchange that creates respect and can change participants. It's not just relaxing; it's a way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world a little bit."
CPE_24,"Broadcasting originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand, like in farming. This idea of broadcasting is not just about farming; it also represents the hope of modern times. It suggests planned growth and a rich outcome if conditions are right. The idea assumes there is a central source of seeds, or information, ready to be spread. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fit this farming metaphor.

Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. But from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. Sending broadcasts from a central place to private homes matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of organising television were tried but remained just experiments.

Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Magazines like Radio News published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. This ended the chance for television to develop as a grassroots, equal form of communication in Britain.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the deep structures of modern societies. In the USA in the early 1930s, television was mainly a medium for public viewing, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people first experienced television. Although the idea of grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems in several countries in the 1930s posed a potential challenge to the home-based model of television. But this challenge did not last.

Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. With the division between public and private life in modern society, centralised broadcasting to homes was the most suitable way to organise television. As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as a centre for entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.

There is a link between social modernisation and the main structures of broadcasting. As societies modernised, they became more centralised, with concentrated capital and political power. Traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which left them more isolated than in stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of national community.

Broadcasting became the dominant form of radio and television because of these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is changing, and the term broadcasting might become outdated. If that happens, the metaphor of broadcasting will be seen as describing a specific way of organising audio-visual technology during a certain phase of social modernisation."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. It often suggests that if you don't have a certain product, you are not as good as others. To see how much ads affect you, try not to read any billboards next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us even noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on how they form, their water systems, and their living organisms. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire to learn more. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves have impacted human life, studies have been even more intense. However, exploring caves often requires physical skill, so cave research is not just done by professors. There is a unique overlap between professional scientists and amateur cave explorers who study caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has become a highly technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses many long words that can be confusing to non-experts. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still crucial for turning computer data into weather forecasts. Human observations can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is primarily about music, with theatre coming second. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.

At musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about what they don't know, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect string section is easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics match. We know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when running for a bus, but they do it much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't particularly impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences. In fact, many people attend both. However, in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play or spectacular the event.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion, humor, sadness, intimacy, and grandeur. It can go wrong unexpectedly and engages the listener's imagination as part of a group. However, the formal traditions in music, like strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists, highlight the difference between performers and listeners, which can feel hierarchical.

On the other hand, modern music audiences sometimes interrupt performances by clapping between movements or after a great solo. While this shows appreciation, it can disrupt the flow of the music. Can anything be done? Yes, a lot is being done. There are efforts to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a top-quality musical experience, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.

What I hope for in music is more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations, which change normal expectations. This can have surprising effects on both performers and audiences. Comforts might be sacrificed, the sound might not be perfect, or it might be a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous and follow artists into unexpected spaces. I know most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe something should change in music conventions. My only authority is as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly an annoying obstacle between the car park at the beach and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, sand sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong water spray. But strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off you. For days, you keep finding sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand flies around when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. No, I don't like sand at all.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security since they first started building houses. The simple wooden bar behind the door has been replaced by electronic locks that use a plastic card with countless combinations. But the desire to keep out intruders is still the same. Locks and keys are partly about feeling secure. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locks, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't really like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of turning a real key in a lock. So, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in it.

**Modern Art**  
I was worried about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I don't really understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially things with fur, neon light sculptures, and large photos. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to analyze it like a school essay. The idea is to let art speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, real labels that explain the context of the art and what it's trying to say. Instead of just staring at the pictures without understanding, these bits of information helped me get it."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When adapting novels into films, a lot of the original content is often reduced or removed. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and description in a novel can be cut without losing the main point. This doesn't mean the original content was unnecessary. It's about how each medium—books and films—engages the audience differently and uses repetition in its own way. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In stage plays, dialogue often mimics real speech, sometimes using a lot of unnecessary words just to keep the conversation going, which can make it hard to understand what's really being communicated.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can be an immersive experience, making you feel part of the film's world. During the movie, you escape from reality, but once the film ends, you're back to the real world. In the past, movies were seen as just entertainment, not art. Many people, including our parents and teachers, thought movies were not serious art, even though they enjoyed watching them.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing mix of different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many similar rooms and no clear main entrance. There were three entrances, but only one led to where you wanted to go. Visitors were rare because the studio didn't encourage them, but employees knew their way around. Together, they created films that offered audiences a break from everyday life, providing romance and adventure.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are full of guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his low-budget film El Mariachi, which launched his career. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his breakthrough film by age 23. In the past, filmmakers took longer to succeed. They gained experience working in different roles before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without studio support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of cramped, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong sulfur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. 

Most of my early life is a blur, but I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, I have vague memories of faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of a mansion at Earlham. My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that her personality was unusual. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as she was on a moor. 

She also had a strict sense of propriety, which was rare on the West Earlham estate. This sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly.' As a moral code, it was beyond my understanding, and even now, I'm not sure I get it. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules and restrictions.

Over time, other people appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. Later, I realized that this group was not great company. They were a sad and depressing group, talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up and free myself from it. This was easier said than done.

Growing up in West Earlham at that time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat. As far as I remember, my mother let other children in the street take care of me on this journey.

If I remember anything about those early years, it's the summer holidays, when you got glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and a charity fete once at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were 'only after your money.' My mother often talked about people having selfish motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, it was as a place where rich people opened letters full of money sent by a gullible public. I might be exaggerating, and I might overlook her good qualities and focus on her flaws. But my mother didn't have much kindness; it seemed to have been taken from her.

To be fair, my mother did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes,' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't completely against this activity and eventually almost had opinions on the art. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick and humid, turning into a light, prickly rain. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well since I was a child. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, all girls, lived in the houses of the Krings and the Pottses. Even though I didn't know everyone by name, each house was unique to me, just like the small channels in the cement that guided rain from the roofs to the street. These channels were important landmarks when I was on my roller skates or scooter. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get smaller and the front yards became tiny. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron, giving a Southern or Spanish look. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, turned back into homes. I wondered how people lived in these spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space because it was hard to separate work from home life. In his previous place, the living and working areas were combined, making it difficult to relax or focus on work. So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and directs attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. Gilbert wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could either cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental furniture from his parents or bought from markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and mysteries, making his adventurous lifestyle a topic of literary debate. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It combined the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and deep insights. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction, changing details to make stories more interesting. His book suggested that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain in 1996, I hurried across my lawn and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I watched raindrops create small fountains that turned into bubbles and burst. The best moments were when the storm got stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was then that I thought about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain's path to the sea, breaking free from the routine of swimming laps. In our world, many places and things are clearly marked and explained, which can make reality feel like just a visual experience. Activities like walking, cycling, and swimming help us reconnect with the wild and mysterious parts of the world by going off the beaten path. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying had no clear purpose in evolution. He was probably wrong. More recent scientists have shown its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps create a bond between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its exact consequences are unclear. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have used these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support six billion people. Any changes to these resources are serious.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These gases are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes the future uncertain. We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed along with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they simplify the real world and have limitations. Their predictions are only estimates, and they are costly and slow to run. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know they are complex.

Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we've seen before. GCMs help us understand what the world might be like in the future. They predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, may become more common in some areas. These forecasts show the potential impact of climate change on nature and humans.

Climate changes could affect where ecosystems like forests and grasslands are located, the species they contain, and their ability to provide benefits that societies rely on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects might be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts could be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952 due to fewer frosts.

However, many predicted effects of future warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, either by long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to start in dry regions and areas with existing water shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed, with more rain in autumn and winter and less in spring.

Another concern is changes to glaciers, which will affect ice and, in turn, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing iceberg risks. The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face significant disruptions, and many people might lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, as they might disappear entirely, causing devastating impacts on their people and culture, and creating challenges for countries that would need to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This is the type of people needed for the first mission to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a spacecraft on 5 January 2018 succeed. The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next chance to launch, when Mars and Earth are in the right positions, won't be until 2031. It's a big challenge, and the race is on to create systems with completely new technologies. If these can be developed quickly enough, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never launches, the work to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as it will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art is what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can hinder our understanding of art.

Moreover, when art becomes highly admired and gains a classic status, it can become disconnected from the human experiences and conditions that created it. This separation makes it difficult to grasp the broader significance of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often placed in a separate realm, away from other human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone studying the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday life experiences. Just like mountain peaks are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists explain how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, art theorists should show how art is connected to human life.

To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the everyday experiences that we don't usually consider as aesthetic. This means taking a detour to understand art. Just like one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding art requires looking at the basic experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.

Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without considering them as art. This is because art is often seen as something that belongs in museums and galleries. However, the desire for enjoyable experiences finds its way into everyday life. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often still separate art from ordinary experiences.

The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday life and work. This connection makes appreciation more widespread and intense."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team: in the evening light, a group of silent cats jumps from the shadows like skilled hunters and surrounds their prey. Lions seem like the perfect social animals, putting aside small disagreements to work together for a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, others might benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are inactive. It has taken many research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a major event for the band, which had been talented but unstable. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. The serious and plain style of the past, with loud guitars, was replaced by a lighter mix of melodic local styles. The album combined social observation and strong emotions with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. They explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, sad songs like 'So Low', a beautiful tune about weather, and 'To the Brink', a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl', wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three books, then offered him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it was a lesson I never forgot. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I wanted to learn about, something relevant to my life. I'm not a keen traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting to be sorted - the so-called slush pile. This is usually done by a junior in the editorial department (under 18) or an experienced person who works part-time. Neither has much influence, but they want to find something original - the junior to make a name and find an author, the experienced person to keep their freelance job. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales, and also consider if you seem like a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them in your letter). They will also consider how promotable you are, which is important when a new novel needs support. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, it might have been the hardest time in your career. The recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 was tough: the GDP went down, interest rates stayed high, people spent less on everything except essentials, over half a million people lost their jobs, and about 75,000 homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with some industries like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% drop. Many people and companies in different countries suffered.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept theirs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help improve company profits and were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also had to do more with less money, being told that ""less must be more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies started focusing more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. This shift meant marketing got more attention from management, and some brands began to be marketed effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was seen as a solution to all problems, which it is not.

About half of most marketing budgets go to advertising, so advertising professionals felt the pressure. The 1980s were great for advertising, but the early 1990s were tough. This was partly due to the economy, but also because clients started questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money. Without clear evidence of advertising's benefits, many clients doubted its value. They wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work.

Advertising professionals faced the same problem as their clients: doing more with less. The recession made it hard to produce effective advertising. Production costs were controversial, and there was a reluctance to take risks, which are often key to good advertising. Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad.

These issues forced advertisers to reconsider the saying: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to make sure more advertising is effective. However, help for improving advertising is not easy to find. Companies and agencies are busy dealing with these challenges and are reluctant to share their successful strategies. Conferences and seminars might offer some help, but books on advertising often don't. They tend to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which doesn't help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was not a common choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't considered a desirable job. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs are known for having tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed-off and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. However, my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal for me. I first saw this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt like I wanted to thank the chef deeply. I felt happy and light for days. After this experience, I wanted to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt empty, distracting me from my real passion. I learned about cooking in a random and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes, I said!"" The following week, I went up onto the high diving board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt like I was in silence. I moved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs went everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he couldn't take away my happiness. ""That's what they mean by 'free as a bird',"" I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both confusing and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing steep, icy mountains prone to avalanches; who sail alone in small boats through huge waves; who will eat maggots and river insects if there's nothing better to eat, and who can live for months in the uncertainty of the unknown. It's easy to see these people as odd - and they are - like hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their strange, uncomfortable world is far from our everyday experience and can be dismissed as irrelevant. We can ignore them and return to our world of microwaves and answering machines, grateful that the only risks we face are predictable ones, like running across a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a top sailor, though he is clearly a capable one. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and successes for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that tells sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a ""fundamental break in the relationship between man and sea."" Raban argues that since the compass was invented, about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, so they no longer need to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the sailor's job is just to stay on course, an autopilot can replace them for long periods. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought we were alone in feeling, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open in a new place, or when reading a great book, which shows us things we ignored before. Our mind becomes aware of new details, like the sky's colors, a friend's behavior, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important details. I could have made more changes, but that would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to predict this, it would not be a true report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and trying to understand what had already happened. This is the real story of mass travel: the world opening up to people who only need a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers are not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is labeled ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, many travelers are confused by the term.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck a few years ago. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in welcoming country houses for weeks. When I stopped traveling, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only made short notes instead of full stories. Worried that details might be out of order, I added many warnings in my writing. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story flow without too many explanations."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the market and trade growth in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Newspaper stories about publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often with help from the people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were playing at around the country were starting to sell out, and extra security was needed to control the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange confidence that only shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future Challenges**

Technology keeps changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It's clear that more people will have access to music because it meets many human needs. Music is part of every major state event and offers many activities for individuals. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these findings need more support, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the near future.

Looking further ahead, will there be changes in focus, and if so, what will they be? I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to a wider variety of music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to create music without needing as much technical skill. However, this might also mean fewer live performances and less need for musicians who only perform live. At the same time, more people of all ages might want to make music themselves, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching should adapt to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring changes to stay relevant for more people. Music education will need to cover a wider range of skills. Musicians will need to inspire and teach people of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. Positively, this is a chance for music educators to show the quality of music teaching available.

Finally, we need to raise the importance of music. Music is vital in our lives but is often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and disrespect. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichés or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked to explain her dance. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote that acting only has life when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Acting has no strict rules, except maybe being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is noticeable when discussing theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of youth and maturity, showing simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence make him a standout actor. Lester plays a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and likable. His performance is subtle yet clearly skilled. Watch how his body seems ready to come alive. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio shows a body moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a true expression? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the phrase, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize the scene. They find the reason to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages not to plan too much but to trust that something will happen naturally.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. Going to a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize that. It's off-putting if the staff seems indifferent. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. Everyone should feel they have a fair view of the actor, not too far away, and able to hear and see clearly. The size of the auditorium is important; it should suit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it loses the human touch essential to drama. Many theatres from the late 19th century got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. Theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, give a feeling of past human presence. You can't please everyone with a play, and audiences often don't know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real importance was how it changed the lives of middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for future rock stars, who listened to it and felt that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this fresh and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was a must-listen for many young people who wanted to become rock stars. Just like young John Lennon, who was far away in Liverpool listening to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow, which looked harmless, collapsed under me. I fell, surprised, into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had made a cover over a gap between two rocks, and it melted away, leaving only a thin layer that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against the top of a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only traveled about half a mile. It was clear that I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to help researchers with qualitative research. While a lot has been written about collecting data, these books often don't explain much about how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers look at their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights and understanding of the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This means making hidden methods more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" acting out a scene from a TV show he watched. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't recall much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned more. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. While new technology can be useful for teaching, formal education still plays a crucial role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by how much money a film makes. A good film might make someone a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village, with a narrow focus on films. People there talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave, working there but living elsewhere. Still, Hollywood is the place where almost everyone in show business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it in photography. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and chemicals on a flat surface created images that were more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists, and after their initial excitement, art critics argued that photography wasn't true art. They believed that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of art. They used photography to interpret the world and show their vision of nature and people, just like artists use brushes and pencils.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations, even novels for older readers. However, as the number of printed books decreased, this practice declined. Children's publishing was active but often operated on a low budget, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white illustrations from this time are a mix of ordinary and exceptional work, offering a rich area for research and discovery. The best works are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reissues of books or exhibitions of original illustrations. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may soon see the potential for reprinting classic children's book illustrations or creating new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This highlighted the risks of sharing too much online. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. 

Feeling down? Maybe, but don't lose hope. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the online world and faced its dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of fame, all before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others recognized the art in his work.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had criticized. This led to her losing her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"Title: Are We Getting Enough Sleep?

Tiredness is often said to be a common problem in modern life. As countries become richer and busier, more people seem to struggle with sleeplessness and anxiety. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. In Britain, some popular novels feature characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, its benefits, and the problems related to it. A key concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""

A sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle into sleeping about eight-and-a-quarter hours a night, showing they needed to catch up on lost sleep.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands studies sleep issues. They have looked into how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise impacts sleep, and the risks of driving when tired. They recruit volunteers through student newspapers, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep patterns for the study. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab is more interested in physical responses.

In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants arrive at 2 pm, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one person trying not to. At first, he sits upright, eyes fixed on the road. Then he starts blinking more often, his head nodding. Each nod gets heavier, and the blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, but by then, the car has veered off the road. A coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests using alertness products like tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain keeps the body still to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's creative parts. But these might also happen when we're awake but relaxed, so it's not certain. Scientists are sure that women sleep about half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, though they don't know why.

When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to pass time safely."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a ""morning sleep."" This break was a time for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily work. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which was more efficient. The industrial revolution later made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns further.

Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In some tribal societies, noise, fire-watching, and predator threats make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems that people worldwide need more sleep."
CPE_60,"I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing 800 dollars, while standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I didn't feel like a real cowboy. As I looked at the Arizona mountains in the morning sun, I realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver and briefly felt like a cowboy, but that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a dirty bag. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word.

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. It was my passion and all I knew how to do. But now, I can't race anymore. I wondered what I should do next. A racing driver should have other plans for when they stop racing, but mine seemed to vanish. I thought about becoming a commentator for races, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work out because nobody was buying them.

Being an ""ex"" anything is tough. People don't want to hear stories about almost being a champion. Even if I had been a champion, people would only listen for a short time. I don't want sympathy because I had a good career and made money. But I miss the thrill of racing, the fast cars, and the excitement. I miss being famous, even a little bit. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me, and kids wanted my autograph.

Now that I don't race, my phone hardly rings. I have a lot of free time. I looked at the sky and noticed there were no buzzards, just some small birds in a cactus nearby. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I realized I had a lot to learn about life outside of racing, just like a fake cowboy in fancy boots."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, locals like to walk around the city, and if you join them, you'll probably hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and work. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that new residents and a growing tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still very much a gateway city.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like me, are often not very good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think we're that focused on money. It's more likely because, in our work, we always try to make a big impact, so the natural flow of a letter is lost on us. Real creative artists, who don't consciously think about the impact of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I think the true test of a real artist is their natural understanding of the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, but it showed his talent as a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer, who knew someone working there, said the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and those who arrived late feel envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film. Despite receiving mostly excellent reviews, the film was not a commercial hit at first. It was television that later made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many people to become filmmakers. This is even more impressive because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film's success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head in agreement, but it seemed like she wasn't really listening. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I mentioned, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more impressive job title over a pay raise. If our desire for status is so strong that it even surpasses our basic desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways of saying the same thing."
CPE_55,"I was in Vienna to take photos. That was usually why I traveled anywhere. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how one photo could capture the essence of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, as long as I had film in my camera. I would finish one roll, load another, and keep looking for that perfect shot. This was my way of life for a long time.

I once took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular. Newspapers and magazines around the world wanted it. It was a brief moment of success, mostly due to luck. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer. It seemed like a smart move, but life didn't go as planned. The mid-1990s weren't as successful as I had hoped, even though my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad.

The Vienna assignment came by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The publishers liked my work, and when the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the project, they asked me to take his place. I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers, so I accepted. Things at home weren't going well, so a week in snowy Vienna sounded good to me.

They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in cold January, it felt different. As soon as I arrived, I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos. The first day, I just explored the city by tram, getting a feel for the place. The weather was cold and the city was full of grand old buildings. I hadn't seen Schussner's photos from other seasons because I wanted to capture my own version of Vienna.

A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. I spent time observing until I was ready. The next morning, I went out at dawn. Fresh snow had covered Stephansplatz, making it look untouched and almost empty. I wasn't sure how to photograph the cathedral in one shot because its spire was tall like a giraffe's neck, but the base was large and heavy. I decided to focus on part of it, hoping to capture something magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even when you understand how it works. Watching a photo develop in a dark room is still mysterious. Maybe that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**  
Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, heavily advertised show, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the 20th century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for a long time, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are displayed with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**  
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative, making it easy to understand, or because it deals with themes of leisure and escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and clever words, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is just an overrated minor artist. However, one could argue that he seems minor because being popular is not always accepted today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to dismiss his work because it doesn't fit an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only time will tell his true place in art history.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**  
In recent years, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by the fact that they were art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but worked together through their contrasts. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**  
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might ruin their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking at art and the act of creating it. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from enjoying the dish. Understanding something doesn't stop us from enjoying it; it might even enhance our pleasure. Enjoyment is complex, and how we perceive it can be questioned. Our preferences are influenced by societal values, not just our genes or personalities. While it's important to appreciate the sensory and instinctive responses to art, the idea that intellectual thought undermines sensory enjoyment is an outdated belief."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have first become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow stone. It didn't feel like a regular stone, but it was beautiful. This is how gold might have become important to early humans. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they started looking for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.

**St Ives**

We walked down the narrow, cobbled street into the town, carrying our bags. The wind was very strong, and we tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the waterfront cottages were shut tight against the storm. We had seen the weather getting worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. The dark grey skies made us question our decision to visit Cornwall in the off-season without a car. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through good and bad times are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling can help us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how these virtual societies react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean trouble for the current leader. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the leader gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked well until the leader made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while calmly walking in the open, revealing his trick.

**What Cats Catch**

In the English village of Felmersham, people collected the prey caught by their cats over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these numbers, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch fewer prey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest there for a while. Eventually, they start swimming, appearing tired and almost submerged, but they spend the day grazing among the reeds and bulrushes.

**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**

In early 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The fish and crab look alive, and the painting is hard to interpret because Picasso used overlapping and interlocking transparent shapes. The colors and brushwork create a calm, underwater feel. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp forms and even a chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,"Photography has been around for about 150 years and has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown in its ability to capture moments in time and space, allowing us to see both big and small things. It has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become a powerful way to express human experiences.

However, using images to record events is not new. The earliest examples of pictorial recording date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early humans created cave paintings—whether they were recording real events, using them for magic to increase animals for hunting, as religious symbols, or simply to decorate their living spaces. But images have always been a part of human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given visual images a special status. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it promised to provide a truthful visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This was a big achievement because artists had spent centuries trying to create such realistic images.

Because photographs seemed so real, people thought everyone would naturally understand them, leading to the idea that photography could be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. But as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we began to question whether photography could truly cross cultural boundaries. Is photography as influenced by culture as language is? Have we become so used to photographs that we overlook the complex ways they convey reality?

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem like a transparent way to communicate. For example, when someone shows a photo from their wallet, saying ""this is my grandson,"" it feels natural. Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people view it have changed a lot. Initially, it was a way to record events, but now photographs have become historical documents, revealing much about the people and societies that created them.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not just reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century saw cultural changes partly due to new ways of visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world in a way that is accessible to many."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching someone how to write poetry is tricky. It's like walking through a dangerous area: you need to be spontaneous, but one mistake can ruin everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination and spirit be free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can write even when they are unhappy. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid, as long as they are not just copying someone else's rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there isn't space for too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something important. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly and keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. Conflict and action should be strong, and every word should matter in the limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing the outcome, seeing only a few moves ahead. As they play more, they realize that chess is about long-term strategy, not just short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game and recognize patterns, like openings and end games. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, as seen in young children, but they don't naturally write. Language exists in all societies, and while languages change, they don't necessarily get better. All healthy children learn to speak without formal lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and has improved slowly over time. Until recently, many children didn't learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. Children naturally learn to speak, but writing is a skill that must be taught carefully. We need to understand how writing works and how children's minds work to teach them effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started writing a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters made-up names and taken care to ensure no one recognizes them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong, kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was remarkable. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be helpful to his future biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for things that matter to me. I have written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but I have taken the same liberty as historians to create speeches for people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. The smart reader will notice where I've used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I hesitated to write this book is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It's hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they enjoyed, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't understand them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen, and if I have written about others in short stories, it's because you can describe characters briefly in them. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't claim my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It is only later that people can see clear patterns and recognize important works. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be written, presented, and understood. There is a general debate between two groups: serious 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on paper, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. However, this division is not strict.

Public poetry readings have become more common over the last twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often expected to perform their work publicly, which has mixed results for them. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live audiences, public performances are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard once, but may seem less impressive when read on paper.

On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, aiming to express deep emotions and thoughts in a concise and rhythmically complex way, may not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. The risk is not that these poets will copy the style of entertainers, but that they might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience.

Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work helps listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm intended by the poet. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's unrealistic to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status compared to the interviewee and the historian's way of understanding history, which might affect the interviewee's responses. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the interviewee's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions in the testimony can seem convincing but might not be from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

Animal science can be studied in two main ways: focusing on the body's functions or looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body's parts, like nerves and muscles, work together to create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the animal's behavior and what influences it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs, studying how animals like rats and pigeons learn. Ethologists study natural behaviors in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more basic. However, understanding every nerve cell's function doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that must be studied separately. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

Students new to social sciences face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of the subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research in textbooks and the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge. These two parts are closely connected. Since we all experience social life daily, social sciences might seem like common sense. However, textbooks show that each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses specific study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, helping social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. Before Vitruvius' time, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that didn't meet his artistic standards. Despite being simple, these early structures contributed to later architectural ideas. No matter how elaborate it looks, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She would finish her drive near the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found out and was amused by Lily's secret driving. He praised her, saying, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought men were strange because Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of the next month, as it was the quietest day for their business. They planned to leave early and return by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

On the day of the trip, they left the house and, within an hour, were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded her. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she decided to pay for parking to avoid any trouble. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""Don't worry, no one will want that heap of tin,"" which annoyed the sisters. Lily accused him of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for judging by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing and thought about his son's future. Chen wanted Man Kee to have a good education and own many restaurants one day.

The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly—a small, old, rusty ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope and said, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It's special for people like us. It will take us back home when we're done here."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Chen let Lily look through the telescope. However, by then, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and all Lily could see were seagulls following the ship's path."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle as I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, but I fell immediately. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had sort of succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit on the head. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear worried voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and old Arthur. Mother was shouting and waving her hands. Father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I hid in the shadows, feeling a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was horrified that no one had seen them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops shone in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one noticed them. Mother was screaming, a sound I had never heard before. It made me feel guilty. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. It had gone from a clever idea to a big problem that wouldn't go away without someone, probably me, getting in trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. From a smart plan to a disaster in just a few minutes. Then I had an idea. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and dizzy. I called out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled forward and collapsed dramatically. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I pretended to be relieved and said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I claimed I crawled and swam through it to escape. I thought I was convincing them until Father asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. Trying to cover up, I said the tunnel collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking it. I said the well was dangerous and I barely escaped. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars. It was like he saw me for the first time, and I realized how my story must sound to an adult. My words stopped. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked at me, his face sad and worried, not because I had a scary adventure and wasn't believed, but because he saw through my lie and was concerned about my character. His pity was as painful as my father's words, showing that this was the adult judgment of my actions, not something I could ignore. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. Memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked how they would bring the house home. Now, Robert was there to help with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Her daughter Francesca was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano with enough care.

Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry. He explained that many people cry when they see their home being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place. Susan could understand this feeling. She remembered when they first moved in, and the piano got stuck on the stairs. It took hours to get it inside, and they even had to remove some banister rails. Her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem by hiring a builder to take out a window and using a crane to lift the piano inside.

Now, Susan was worried about the piano again. She hadn't warned the movers about the tricky stairs. As the movers prepared to take the piano out, Susan felt anxious. Fred reassured her that they were almost done. Robert and Francesca watched as the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out the door. When it was safely outside, they all started laughing with relief. As they walked down the path for the last time, Susan's tears were tears of laughter, not sadness."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

Is do-it-yourself literary criticism just harmless fun? From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or start a music channel online. In reality, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to share their opinion on a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it let potential buyers see what other readers thought, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. But Amazon, being the largest with over 80% of the online market, attracted the most reviews and, therefore, faced the most issues. This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and it was impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team of editors to ensure reviews followed their guidelines. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks, or spoilers were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team.

This anonymity allowed for some mischief. For example, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. Lev Grossman, an author, wrote fake positive reviews for his book after receiving negative ones. His trick worked until he admitted it in an article, and the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon did not verify if the comments were truly from the authors, except for famous writers. A fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed because it was clearly not from him.

Most controversies came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it was praised by the mainstream press. However, people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon's review section to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but were later removed. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. Reviews were meant to be a place to discuss books, not a chat room, so Amazon closely monitored bestselling books to ensure reviews followed the rules. Silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology.

Overall, most Amazon reviews were serious and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant inventing feelings about books one didn't care about. This makes the democratization of book reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to modern art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, claiming it is no longer art. The media often express these thoughts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in contemporary art. We want artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that cannot be contained by conventions. In the past, people would commission artists for specific purposes, making art a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own ideas and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it doesn't seem too mysterious. But if it does, that's modern art for you. Here's the situation: An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and then concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This sounds like simple thinking. But stay with me. The situation gets more complex. The artist asks someone to make a canvas, stretch it, and prepare it. Then, he asks a sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas, instructing them not to make the lettering flashy or charming. The sign painter writes the text in simple black letters on a white canvas. So, my important question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

In the art world, it is often expected that once a painter finds success in a certain style, they should stick to it. Collectors want artists to keep producing similar work, and trying something new can upset them. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public may feel insecure and want consistency. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed. Picasso and Hockney are examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new, and it is uncertain if he will succeed. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Railways have always fascinated Rimmington. After drawing the railway land of London's Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, it was natural for him to explore underground. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique magic of this underground world designed for people on the move.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I am not sure why I use the word 'escape.' The villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from the old peasant woman who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am completely alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of the work I do with my mind and heart is that only there, in the silence of the painter or writer, can reality be reorganized and shown in its true form. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the beautiful pattern underneath. For us artists, art offers a joyful way to deal with everything that hurt or defeated us in daily life. This is not to avoid destiny, as ordinary people try to do, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"{'index': -9, 'text': 'None'}"
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with their money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had been successful in his work, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency shortly after having twins. She even got a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who really wanted to move, and Simon didn't resist much. She argued that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't good enough for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him feel resentful. During these journeys, he would think about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. His grandmother believed in giving the breadwinner peace and comfort after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset. She had confronted Simon with accusations. She claimed that Brian Cartwright, whom Simon had defended four years ago, said Simon knew Cartwright had bribed jurors but did nothing. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied these accusations, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered feeling similar shame as a child facing punishment. He wished he had been prepared and could have responded better. He thought he should have said Cartwright mentioned the bribes after the trial, but he didn't believe him then and still didn't. Instead, he lied directly, and Venetia knew it. Simon wondered why she was so angry and what his past mistake had to do with her. He questioned if her own actions were always perfect. He feared she could ruin his career, even if it was just a rumor."
CPE_36,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops start to recognize you, even if you don't feel like you're living a real life. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I'm watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back the plants. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall to survive.

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested in them. I have her latest book with me now. ""How's the writing going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,"" she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't really want her in the garden, which now looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. ""You're on holiday now,"" she says, sitting in the chair while I sit on the grass. ""I should've been a teacher. Writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can't, teach."" And some can't do either. ""What are your plans for the holidays?"" she asks. I feel anxious about the empty days ahead. Hot pavements, the walk to the shops, the park, and loneliness.

""I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?"" I ask, feeling nervous. ""Of course,"" Jaz says, knowing she will be around. ""Where will you stay? A nice B&B?"" ""No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight."" This isn't true, but I often deal with fiction. ""Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?"" Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could seem cruel, always bringing things to other houses and returning her rejected manuscripts. I decide to be honest. ""Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good,"" I suggest. ""Teachers!"" Jaz responds like a rebellious student. ""I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,"" I say, sounding old-fashioned. ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann."" But I do have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calming, but then I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, winking and saying, ""I've had my moments."" We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and their lives. But beyond that, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and as a nation. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the future by understanding the past. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture passed down through generations. There might be parts of our national heritage we don't like, but it is still part of us, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we connected with our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society broke up communities, and much of this oral tradition has been lost. Now, places and buildings help us learn about our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I thought the Fens were a quiet, empty place to set my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, there is a place that feels foreign to many English people, even though other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open and mysterious. While writing my novel, I didn't visit many places in the Fens. I haven't been to Wisbech or Prickwillow yet. As a fiction writer, I like to imagine worlds and prefer to make inspired guesses rather than rely on facts. Imagining the Fens makes sense because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogs, and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items that only museums can provide.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly now that it affects most of us. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature of towns today and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before them because stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**  
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used in ads for smart products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking basic concepts like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people relied on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**  
When we were kids, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would hint at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few good books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**  
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mysterious origin has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller claimed that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. Humans in dangerous lands with scary animals made desperate sounds, and languages have kept some of these sounds, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, unlike what philosopher John Locke thought when he described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode looks at the skill of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are written quickly and have a short lifespan. They have deadlines and strict word limits. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in, which could be a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this short life, reviews are often not seen as important literature. Many people, including the writers, think reviewing is a job done for extra money or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a complex and skilled job. Writing a short, fair review of 600-800 words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed 6,000-8,000 word review for an international journal. A 1,500-word review in a weekly magazine has challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. Reviewers need to know a lot about many topics and write clearly and engagingly. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews, even short ones, into books with modest titles. Some might think less famous writers should accept that their reviews are temporary, but if they can, they should enjoy some recognition, especially if they believe their best work is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, it's common for the same people to write both reviews and academic studies. In the past, academics criticized professors who wrote reviews for showing off or wasting time, but now it's more accepted. Complaints from non-professors that professors are taking their jobs are also less common, partly because there are more reviews to write and partly because the pay is often low. I believe this is good for readers, who can trust the reviewer knows the subject, and for professors, as it helps them stay connected to a wider audience. It reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when writing for a general audience. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, still hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a brief doubt about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if it had been. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to spending three or four evenings alone at home each week. Once he left the artificial world of the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his belongings, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited in vain for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would often read or listen to music at night, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed to get lost in his mind. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first opportunity that came along. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he found he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find happiness in his work. He went to his only job interview with gratitude and didn't think to evaluate the job—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see a goat race. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track where the goats would run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since the morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance. Ask colleagues to think of difficult questions your audience might ask. Also, create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some mental tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing mental math faster. But other tasks cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line. Saying ""Think fast; we need the results"" can be as silly as trying to sleep for only half the night. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. Generally, the mind has three different speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my brain and body quickly reacted to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast physical intelligence is often called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, building arguments, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won't start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment all use this type of intelligence, which relies on reason and logic. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is another, slower mental process. It is often less focused and more relaxed or dreamy. In this mode, we are thinking things over, being contemplative or meditative. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind time to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. In fact, slow thinking is an important part of our mental abilities. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed, open mental attitude. Recent studies show that slower, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options might be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and even ""wisdom."" Poets have long known the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists started to study these slower ways of knowing. The field of ""cognitive science"" is showing that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote area. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my confidence. I felt nervous about mealtimes, unsure which table to sit at, and worried about the silence when I spoke. I felt anxious like I did in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage my speaking skills usually give me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just another young author, and he didn't pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face, and when we met again, he would shake my hand politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed Elliot started to like me more. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films. He focused on the photography, soundtrack, and technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people reacted to pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film was designed well, audiences from Japan and India would react at the same moment. Hitchcock was precise and logical, a genius craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his characters deeply. He focused on pure film and the calculated beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create almanacs and charts, analyze observations, and publish results. This might seem like the best time ever for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Today, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Our society has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In today's economy, people always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, one after another. This can be overwhelming and stressful, leading to a feeling of disconnect from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It's a family tradition started by my grandmother, and now it feels very special. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I don't like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem like they might pat you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them around the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

An outstanding production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London, giving me a chance to correct a previous unfair review I wrote when it first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the main role and underestimated his acting skills. Although I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important to the story, I now admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is truly impressive. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include Cassio's intense games with other young officers, which become dangerously chaotic, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are amazing. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, everything is still. While there are many penguins, seals, and birds on the edges of the continent, the vast white interior is lifeless. However, beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, there is a huge hidden freshwater lake called Lake Vostok, located directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths to find out what unusual organisms might live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years could be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is debating what motivates them to become scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the timeless quest for knowledge and the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire in the first place and why science can't explain it. Surely, it's more important to consider whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too much sugar and preservatives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays, anniversaries, and engagements, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had vandalized the place. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she wasn't going to help with the office mess. She believed he was like a visitor from another world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn streets.

**KAREN**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed as a reminder of past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's exciting to be the first to know something important, and her quiet life didn't have much excitement. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly throat infections, which were her only health issues. His best quality was making patients feel he had plenty of time for them and truly wanted to hear their worries. This quality made him very loved by the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Joanna's performances are exciting, and even people who don't know much about music can enjoy them. She plays many different styles, like classical, jazz, and blues, and even does fun tricks like plucking the piano strings. At a recent concert for children, a boy asked her to play the theme from ""Match of the Day,"" a popular TV show. Joanna found this amusing and played it, proving to the boy that she was a ""proper pianist.""

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play the piano. She has published a beginner's piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even though she is very busy. This summer, she is involved in many music festivals and projects, and she also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. People are surprised she took on the extra work of writing a book, but she believes the first lessons in music are very important. She thinks music should be accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent.

Joanna's experience with teaching beginners and growing up in a home where her mother taught piano has influenced her. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children learn quickly, but she is interested in those who progress at different rates and sometimes give up. She worries that some parents push their children too hard to achieve in music, rather than letting them enjoy it.

Joanna's books are colorful and engaging, with storylines and CDs to make learning fun. She believes learning should be enjoyable and encourages children to improvise and explore the piano. As children progress, they need to learn to read music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes practice is the most important part of learning. She didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she learned to love it. Now, she practices eight hours a day, which she considers the core of her musical life. She advises setting clear goals for practice, rewarding yourself, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is usually not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is difficult to achieve. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard, which made me think more carefully. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with more care. On the other hand, using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said as he returned to the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's incredible they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, as he turned on the hi-fi system. Lights came on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't use both sides and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my chair. ""Anyway, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo sound, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches were invented after lighters, we'd be amazed by the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time, and such claims are often self-centered, thinking their generation is at a historical turning point. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. This prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to read only small parts. Some technology enthusiasts argue that this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text in one go.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was free of the papers that had covered it since it was installed, and the desk was the dark wood he remembered from an auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about adding a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talents. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Lancelot's secretary shouted, ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" She wasn't really asking because she had been making him coffee for months. She often forgot things because he wasn't supposed to be there. However, he was there all the time now because staying away would cause chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work.

His secretary handed him a folder, saying it was from someone in Los Angeles. The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert"" and ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis; he wanted a first draft. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but commissioning books from friends had been a mistake. Ian was unpredictable and unreliable.

Lancelot skimmed the synopsis, recognizing almost every phrase. He realized Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and seemed to lack conviction. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But Ian had already received a large advance, which went against the usual business practice of paying authors after they deliver a manuscript.

Lancelot recalled when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge, where his peers took over British theatre. Ian was even more talented but never fulfilled his potential. He was difficult to work with, even when appointed to edit an arts magazine, which never published despite using up its budget. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased in hopes of making him produce more.

At editorial meetings, Ian was critical and sarcastic, but ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to admit that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"Text: 'The breakfast change in England

Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is a relatively new habit in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common for everyone. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. However, they might not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns could explain why breakfast became more important. People started working set hours, often very early in the morning. So, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might understand the photos they see, but instead of just accepting them, we might ask if the photo truly shows what the scene looked like at that moment. Or, does it show the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus entirely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows you to shine individually, but it's also a team game, and you need to balance both. It's similar to life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot - not just money. It has opened opportunities for me and shown me things around the world that others might never see. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they stand out clearly in our memories. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was lying awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from somewhere in the tall trees around the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I thought of my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with amazement as each surprising musical variation came through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Birds have always been important in human culture. They are loved, feared, and even worshipped. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. Wrens are seen as mysterious birds, linked to predictions and messages. Is this wren trying to tell us something, or is it just trapped? Both ideas could be true, depending on how you see it. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, wrens still hold a special place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty and sad.

This connection to birds comes from a long history of folklore. In the past, people depended on nature for survival and developed a way to understand the world through the behavior of animals. This understanding changes over time. For example, in the 1500s, red kites were common in London and were seen as helpful scavengers. Later, they were considered pests and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain.

Our relationship with birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn of danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected people to their dreams and the supernatural. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and envy. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of us, like the appendix or wisdom teeth. Losing them would be painful.

Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings, representing love and magic. Their loss is felt deeply by those who know their significance in literature and folklore. However, birds without cultural stories are often ignored when they disappear.

Folklore is important because it keeps the connection to birds alive in a way that scientific terms cannot. Stories, legends, and rhymes about birds have a strong bond with their subjects and evoke feelings and attitudes that science cannot capture. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we don't fully understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages.

The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding a mystery in its song and flying into the future, leaving us to wonder."
CPE_28,"Maps are used to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through an area than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, knowing ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" was more crucial than precise directions. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, sometimes more so than maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions accurately. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of these signs depended on the map's purpose and where it was made, so understanding early maps requires knowing the specific style used.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and making maps more detailed. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people started using the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it. Astronomers found out that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for military purposes, especially after the introduction of artillery, which required understanding the landscape in detail. This led to the invention of contour lines to show elevation. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps for their work. Today's map makers, or cartographers, have developed ways to map various things, like geological layers, climate, and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.

However, the development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change, with old ideas sometimes existing alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what needed to be done but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since making a map by copying an old one is easy, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers have sometimes been slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"I was invited into a young man's living room, which felt like a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms around it where his less ambitious family members spent their time. Moving from the kitchen to his living room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. In this room, I saw the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprisingly, a teenager who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't a matter of life or death, although it's easy to say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy goal for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I was open to trying it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' record collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and showing him a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact in musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we didn't succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the brief certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would, of course, keep looking at the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and would write a few more simple songs that didn't show the limits of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't really inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, borrowing too much from Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title as well, most of which had probably been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have an amazing ability: we can communicate with each other in a very precise way. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a special spider teacher, and they don't need to be good at building to do it.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can change the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Daily weather patterns, which together make up the climate, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing because the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement happens because the air is on a spinning Earth, and it doesn't move as fast as the planet. The sun is an even more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks, but I was more worried about making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, including how to clean and maintain the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be sent back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get good at it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail to make good programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These art forms should be perfect for TV because cameras can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see details. However, there are few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I thought the series would focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of the industry, and it fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't come with one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis available. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"Title: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK

At the Bamboo Bike Club in Hackney Wick, east London, you can join a weekend course to build your own custom bamboo bike frame. The club is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. On a Saturday morning, the sound of machinery fills the air as participants start their bike-building journey. The atmosphere is lively and fun, unlike any typical woodwork class.

Bamboo is becoming popular in bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, their ready-made bamboo frames are expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable, so they spent years developing a product that average cyclists could afford. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell frames.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business. James and Ian run it alongside their full-time jobs—James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. Their courses are popular because they offer a custom-designed bike frame and a fun weekend experience at a competitive price.

For someone like me, who isn't great at DIY, the quality of the bike was a concern. On the first day, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and form solid joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes together to form the bike's frame. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. The course requires using tools and following design plans, which can be challenging for beginners. However, James and Ian are always there to help and ensure everything is done correctly.

Most participants enjoy the hands-on experience, and many are engineers. But even if you're not, Ian assures that mistakes are okay—you can always try again with a new piece of bamboo. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, allowing you to focus on the frame's appearance, choosing from plain, black, or mottled bamboo.

On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. A final coating makes the bike waterproof, and it's ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian has used his bamboo bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without damage.

Bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they have a unique charm. They are ideal for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making the ride comfortable. James says the real joy comes when the bike is on the road—it's light, effortless, and fun to ride. And the best part? The cost is less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now very wealthy, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how men and women can communicate better is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans improve their lives, but it also takes advantage of their desires for self-improvement. It supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books that seem exaggerated or not very serious. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. Editors are looking for the next big hit, focusing on how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions. She admits, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's most of the work done. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth will be told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers might leave out things they find too embarrassing or unimportant. Sometimes, they might change the truth to better express their story. An autobiographer might even decide from the start not to stick to the truth. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without being cynical.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Experts say detective stories became popular because they reflect the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it shows how society can return to order. In Hammett's stories, society is restored but shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are similar. They understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The detective is both a criminal and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his understanding of the criminal, and sometimes his desire to punish is stronger because of this.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To talk about his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said, ""I couldn't write about a place like this. Trollope might, but he knew the culture. Understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. Science is like its own civilization. Only scientists can present it well. If you don't know the community and its rules, you struggle from the start."" Gould believes you should never talk down to the reader. ""Don't make concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but not the argument. If readers feel patronized, your piece fails."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. This is because the gym has used too much air-conditioning to cope with the unusually high temperatures this summer. At quieter times, the gym feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It has become a key part of both work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple methods can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is not surprising that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations—interesting but outdated in a modern world. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I used to think of china-painting as something done by serious, older women who could paint perfect flowers on teacups without any mistakes. I saw this at an arts and crafts show long ago, and it was fascinating to watch. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed like they had either practiced for many years or had a natural talent. Remembering this, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners also have this natural skill? In reality, the class was not intimidating at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher didn't want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly and perfectly as I had seen before."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent told them that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they arrived at the hotel, and they were too tired to question it. The next morning, they realized they were supposed to stay there for the whole holiday. The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken.

Keith calmly explained that they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said their group was booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, approached them. She explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and they might have followed the wrong group.

Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left to check, and the receptionist was gone. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened. An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted his thoughts, saying they had a great night's sleep.

Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had even said that was the point of the holiday when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"American executives are now looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports on this trend. In Britain, many people know about Sir Ernest Shackleton and his achievements. However, in America, he has only recently gained attention. The Wall Street Journal even called him 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the Endurance are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about his life.

Some American managers have started to see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his leadership and communication skills and use his story as a lesson for modern management. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has been inspired by Shackleton for years. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises, like when a company's plant explodes or when many employees are laid off. MacGregor believes that Shackleton is a great example of leadership because he was a strong communicator and had clear values. He was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives.

One of Shackleton's most important decisions was during his 1908 expedition to the South Pole. He decided to turn back when they were only 97 miles away from their goal because their supplies were running low, and they needed to return to their ship. This decision showed his commitment to the safety of his men, which earned him credibility for future expeditions.

Shackleton's 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Despite this, Shackleton assured his men that they would reach safety if they trusted him and did their best. He always stayed in control, planned for every situation, and kept his men informed. He was adaptable and ready to start over if needed. MacGregor says that Shackleton's story helps clients understand management principles without feeling criticized.

Shackleton believed that an explorer needed optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor points out that in America, people often want quick solutions, but sometimes it's better to wait and let things work out. For example, if you invest in bonds and the interest rates change, it's better to hold on rather than sell at a loss. Similarly, if a new product isn't successful, don't keep trying to sell it.

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed that the expedition photographer, Hurley, was without gloves. Shackleton gave him his own gloves, insisting that Hurley wear them. He did the same with a biscuit during a 1905 expedition when they were starving, showing his selflessness. Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says that the public's interest in heroic stories is growing, and Shackleton represents the ideals we long for today."
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae hidden in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects.

Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her baby Annabelle. He wanted to see if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood's surface, like holes where insects might have entered.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several drilled holes. Some holes led to cavities with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the cavities with food, showing they didn't need visual clues like surface holes. They also didn't rely on smell or sound to find the insects. Even when the smell was blocked, and the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them.

Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes could sense the cavities themselves. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and listens with its large ears. Dr. Erickson thinks the aye-aye uses echo-location, listening for echoes from the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye replaces woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role might not be empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat but also behaves like a squirrel. Its teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we really know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories often give us only small, incomplete pieces of their past. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they still only show part of the story.

Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. These are books of at least 20,000 words, sometimes with pictures, telling the stories of ordinary people, not celebrities. The idea came to her when she realized that much of her family's past was disappearing. ""At first, I didn't take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people with interesting lives who wanted to share their stories. They say they do it for their children or future generations, but they also enjoy the process.""

The promise of privacy helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man, who made and lost a fortune, shared his story. ""I was surprised by what I revealed. Some things, like my divorce, were still painful,"" he says. ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something. But I haven't let my children read it yet. If they insist, I will, but I'd prefer they read it after I'm gone.""

He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things parents say and do affect their children for life. People often marry someone their parents would like or do the opposite to rebel.""

Many people still feel disappointed about unresolved issues with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who was never impressed, and some want to say, ""I can't stand my mother.""

Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an investigator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to pry. People sometimes share things and then doubt if it should be included. I include it, but they can remove it later. Generally, people want to be honest.""

""It's not about vanity or thinking the world needs to know their life story. Life is moving fast, and we're losing touch with the past. This gives people a connection to their ancestors. People want a bit of immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the book's binding. The final product is high quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost is a barrier for many. ""I thought it would be more affordable,"" she says. ""But my clients are often wealthy, the kind who might have had portraits painted for their descendants."""
CAE_24,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few remaining collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. It's important to know that none of the sculptures are original; they are all accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

We have a membership program that allows members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to improve their skills through our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We sell photographic books, magazines, and a full range of photographic materials.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**

The Sedgwick Museum has an impressive collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and from all over the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, belonging to Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728), with nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens kept in their original early 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to see the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with detailed labels explaining their nature and modern uses.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**

This collection has over 400,000 air photographs, both oblique and vertical, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and does photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased, which takes about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world and is a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center has preserved the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, used as an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many of the beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**

I have had 35 years of raising young children, and I have loved every moment of it, even though my personal life has been unusual. This morning, I fed the baby, and to me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky because my children and I share interests like opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I am more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't called, it makes them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was about 25 when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to new music, youth culture, and fashion. This has been very helpful for my work at the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy building my business, so I missed some important events like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies with us without feeling shy. I think it's an advantage that they see my job as exciting and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more involved in politics, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if there are facilities for my kids to come with me. This way, they understand what I do when I'm not with them, and they don't feel like I'm disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the importance of involving our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about being a father. I worked hard to stay in touch with my children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other so the kids could visit both of us easily, but Kate and Bonnie found it confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently complained that we were too liberal. I think I should have been more organized. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your kids never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready to have kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a nice house. We thought, ""Why keep spending money on new things when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand myself better. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just another parent like many others. It's a humbling experience. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her makes it all go away. A baby's smile is the best way to melt a grown man's heart."

**A. Tamburlaine the Great**  
Marlowe's long play about a powerful warrior can feel endless, but in Terry Hands' version, it's one of the most exciting shows of the year. He has cut a lot from the original text, making it fast and full of action. Antony Sher is amazing in the main role, doing stunts like somersaulting from a balcony and sliding down a rope while speaking. His performance demands full attention as he portrays a character obsessed with power and glory. It's a great show.

It's highly recommended, though it's a painful read, especially at the end."
CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular airplane. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the inside was different, and the 13 students from Europe and America were about to have an unforgettable flight. Inside, it was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat. For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight, organized by the European Space Agency. The challenge was to propose creative experiments to be done in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride.

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, going up and then diving down. The goal was to create a moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In the few silent seconds between going up and falling, everything inside the plane became weightless, and the students felt as if they were closer to the moon than the Earth.

The plane took off smoothly, but any thoughts that this was a normal flight disappeared when the pilot made the Boeing climb at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines stopped, and we instantly felt weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step sent us towards the ceiling. We floated aimlessly; directions like left or right, up or down, no longer made sense. Only gravity, by keeping us grounded, allows us to understand the idea of moving somewhere else.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned less suddenly than it disappeared, but still quickly enough that some students landed with a bump. After the first curve, some students turned pale at the thought of 29 more to come. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students soon studied the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to understand how cats always land on their feet. They released their device, which floated belly-up, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using remote control. However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on it during a rough return to gravity.

Next to the slightly dazed robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joins is affected by the lack of gravity, with future space stations in mind. Another team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to make these films in microgravity. They believe that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unsettled, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This was an experience that would stay with us for a long time. ""It was unforgettable,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from the UK, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my siblings and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very fertile, but it was good for planting trees.

I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees appealed to me. I was eager to start, and my family became enthusiastic as we progressed. We began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the entire 70 acres.

In 1968, New Zealand had a very rainy winter. It rained almost every day while we were planting, and I was often wet and cold. Every morning, I faced the challenge of getting ready for another day of planting. I would step out of the Land Rover, already wet from the previous day, with rain pouring down, and my boots and clothes still damp. Despite the discomfort, my mind would wander, and I would think about life and nature.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. We used a planting bag filled with as many trees as possible. The bag was heavy at first, but it got easier as it emptied. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. We decided on the spacing for the trees and used three poles to guide us. Once aligned, we planted along the line, turned around, and came back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, planting became automatic. I developed a rhythm and used the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs, where you train your body to perform standard moves, making the work easier. The process became regular: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, planting it, stamping it in, and moving on.

Mentally, it was interesting. My mind would wander, and I started thinking about the natural world and our place in it. These thoughts have influenced my life since then. I've returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which is satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them, and I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand. Fortunately, the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.

In 1984, I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. I stayed in a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. I still feel a strong connection to that area. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth, and it's a powerful bond."

When one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box, my first thought was, ""What now?"" My husband Derek and I have been running an ""open farm"" in Somerset for six years, where we care for orphaned animals. The noise from the box was unfamiliar, a mix between a cackle and a bark. Curious, I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky-colored eyes on their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If they become orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by builders who accidentally dug into their den while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still nursing. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the mother licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. They seemed content with each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum.""

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow seemed tired, although he was still eating normally. It was a warning sign I didn't recognize. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's post-mortem showed Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Disheartened by my failure, I continued caring for the others. Then, six days later, a local farmer who heard about our cubs brought me another male cub. He found it abandoned behind some silage bags. The mother wouldn't return because the area was too disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. Over the next few days, I learned why his mother left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to move the bottle's teat around in his mouth and squeeze it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything else. Willow was different. He gave up the bottle but couldn't eat without walking through his food, tipping it over, or sitting in it. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly chewed, played with, and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods.

At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my badgers started becoming nocturnal, going for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur to look like snowballs, and chase each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we were part of this game. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, didn't and sometimes reacted colorfully to being bitten. During these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territories to find food, as badgers are very territorial and can kill others that enter their area. We were warned they might climb into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure.

The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a campaign to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walking direction. It had three chambers, one slightly larger, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they forgot about the walks, excited by climbing through the tunnels and arranging bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of it, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I checked on them and saw three badgers curled up asleep in their chambers. These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before rushing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"Title: In Search of True North - The Legacy of Sir Edmund Halley

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, is planning to follow the path of Sir Edmund Halley, who is famous for the comet named after him. However, Halley's important work in his time was mapping the 'variations of the compass,' now called 'declination.' Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north, which sailors needed to correct their compasses and navigate accurately. Without this knowledge, determining longitude and navigating the oceans was very difficult.

Halley was one of the few people paid to do scientific research in his time. He set out to map declination in the North and South Atlantic, starting with a trip to the Cape Verde Islands. This trip was cut short due to problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. His second journey took him to places like Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, and Newfoundland before returning to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it outdated.

Dr. Clark, who is also a sailor, wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the route of the ship Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. Halley was not only an astronomer but also worked in geophysics, mapped stars, developed a diving bell, and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous work, Principia Mathematica.

Dr. Clark's expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore,' will have scientific value. He plans to take the same measurements Halley did, but with modern, precise instruments. This is important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data collected will help improve the current model of Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field. Dr. Clark explains that measuring the direction of the magnetic field requires knowing true north, which they can determine using global positioning satellites.

The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the expedition. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean. Ground-based measurements are also useful for comparison.

Halley's journey was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. Dr. Clark has the experience needed for this journey, having spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England, a distance of 13,000 kilometers. The expedition will be done in four stages with different crews.

Dr. Clark is committed to this project, saying he is willing to dedicate eight months of his life to it. He feels a strong sense of purpose inspired by Halley's life and work."
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, how did such extravagant features evolve? Darwin believed that evolution happened through natural selection, where the strongest and most adaptable survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection.' He thought females chose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most attractive males, there must be a practical reason. The flashy tails might signal some hidden quality that helps survival. This debate continues today because studying peafowl behavior is challenging. At Whipsnade, where 200 peafowl live in semi-wild conditions, researchers like Marion Petrie are trying to find answers.

Petrie and her team are exploring two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have other advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it just about looks, as Darwin thought? Observations show that peahens do favor males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. These males attract more mates. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be healthier and free of parasites, which their plumage might indicate. While this is true for some birds, Petrie's team hasn't been able to test this in Whipsnade peacocks. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If so, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' It suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit the tail, and daughters will inherit the preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to increasingly extravagant tails, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.' Modern computer models show this feedback loop could indeed create a peacock's tail."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on design changes from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly anchored in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. Some might think I'm a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses the charm of old boat designs, but modern technology made it easier to build. 

However, while modern technology is important in boat design and building, it often separates sailors from the real experiences of being at sea. These are the experiences they wanted to have by going to sea. I'm not saying sailors should suffer through every hardship. I always make sure my boats have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. But why go sailing if everything is done automatically? Sometimes, dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor. 

Also, why should we move the steering position from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot in the middle? The sad reason is to create a cabin with more space, like an ocean liner, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house. 

When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, which I sailed around Britain for a TV race, the former owner said it had every comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned how right he was. Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the nicest, easiest boat I ever sailed. 

However, classic boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized I had to end my 15-year relationship with Hirta. I couldn't find a suitable younger boat, so I decided to build a new one. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design programs, Irens first sketched the boat on a napkin and then used the computer. After creating a model, we adjusted the design until it was perfect. 

The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails beautifully, and her interior, made from reclaimed wood, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, without focusing on furniture. This traditional method proves that you don't need to follow trends to be satisfied. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a traditional one."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are doing very well. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed a break. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I did nothing but sleep. From the second day, I joined many classes like body conditioning, yoga, and stretching. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The one-hour facial made me feel refreshed. The staff were friendly and professional, creating a lively and enthusiastic atmosphere. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bikes around the grounds or enjoy a peaceful walk in the garden. By the end of my stay, I felt happier and more energetic. I can't wait to go back. This is a perfect getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this grand home was clear as soon as I entered. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and lots of space, so you can be alone if you want. Everyone gets a medical check-up when they arrive, which includes checking weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, they found a shoulder problem during my check-up, and the fitness instructor helped me with it in group and individual sessions. Each person gets a specific diet plan. I lost weight without fasting, but I was hungry and got a headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit with yogurt and hot broth for dinner. If you're not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You get a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a large lounge. If you're watching your weight, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a pool to help burn off the calories. You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight. There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big draw is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, the surrounding countryside is beautiful. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre estate. Waldo's, a famous restaurant, has a menu that is hard to resist. The meal was amazing, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments if you want them, before enjoying a meal at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's delicious, but the worst because it's 360 calories, which isn't great if you're trying to lose weight. You've been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best night's sleep in years. The place is modern and well-run, with up-to-date facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. I would love to visit here once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still over 98% the same as chimps. On a big evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is a recent change. Our ability to make art and do other things we think are uniquely human must come from a small part of our genes. This is a lot to expect from just a few genes. So, it's not surprising that studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are actually shared with animals, just to different degrees. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks as tools and weapons, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have a simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.

But if human art comes from a unique genetic gift, it's strange that our ancestors didn't make art for most of the 7 million years since they split from chimps. The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't know for sure because those materials don't last. Clear evidence of human art only appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from similar animal works? Three main differences are often suggested: human art is not useful, it's made for beauty, and it's learned, not instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might say human art doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike most animal behaviors. Human art can communicate thoughts or feelings, but that's not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps defend territory or attract mates, which helps pass on genes. By this measure, human art seems different.

The second claim is that only human art is made for aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, so they probably don't sing just for pleasure. Again, human art seems unique here.

The third difference is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, inherit their songs and would sing them even if they never heard them. It's like a French baby raised in Japan suddenly singing the French national anthem. Human art changes quickly, unlike animal behaviors. Roman authors described geese honking 2,000 years ago, just like today. But human art changes so fast that even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, as human. In fact, they were chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and most of their paintings sold, which many human artists can't claim.

These paintings by our closest relatives blur some lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, the ape paintings weren't made for practical reasons but for the painter's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's often meant to communicate. The apes didn't care about communicating with other apes and just discarded their paintings. But this isn't a strong argument, as some human art that became famous was also made for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"Title: A Big Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that hasn't been fully explored. It's also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to share his story. 

Today, there aren't many big adventures or heroes left. In the past, children's stories often featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes focused on distant horizons as they journeyed into the unknown. Nowadays, such people are rare in both fiction and real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore led an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored places on earth. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', and locals call it the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of this incredible journey from the comfort of his home.

His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. However, the camel handlers turned out to be long-distance truck drivers who had never worked with camels before. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and put the expedition at risk.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something to himself. 'I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to find out who Charles Blackmore really was, outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading about their crossing might wonder why he used the word 'kind'. The team faced many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and losing part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at our limits and the camels hadn't had water for seven days, we found some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's famous sandstorms. And we never faced the freezing desert cold that could have stopped us completely. That's not to say we didn't face challenges the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often fell on us.'

'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn't allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very worried about my physical ability. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" At that moment, I was very scared.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've gone through so much; you have so much behind you. We were very thin but very strong and muscular despite being exhausted. My body was in great shape, and my legs were like machines. I could walk over anything.'

In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the difficulty it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I doubt myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to do that. As a personal achievement, I'm prouder of that expedition than anything else I've done. But in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- compared to that, the desert doesn't measure up.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I long for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the purpose of it all. We were lifted by our sense of purpose. I find it hard now to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Life was becoming overwhelming for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand again. Everyone loves technology because it gives us amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. We've been subtly convinced that technology is essential, and that's okay. But there are clear consequences. Using my hands doesn't consume energy like our power-hungry society does. Handcrafting doesn't harm the environment. A recent bad experience with my broken word processor, which cost me a lot to fix, made me realize that gadgets might not be worth the cost or hassle. Are we as reliant on technology as we think? Gradually, I've been letting household gadgets go as they break down. This makes me question what ""time"" technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? If so, marketing experts have tricked us. When my gadget started making strange noises, even when unplugged, I left it in the backyard, where it now sits like a ghost. I'm no longer tied to a noisy machine, and I can take my time with my sewing. I was always a bit scared of those electric machines that rush towards your fingers. The best part is, I can put everything in a bag and take it with me anywhere. Of course, there are some gadgets I wouldn't want to live without. A year without a washing machine showed me how valuable it is. But losing some gadgets has been surprisingly nice. Feeling like we were spending too much time in front of the TV, I returned the rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. It's hard on the eyes but makes us focus on what's worth watching. Now, we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I stopped using my old sewing machine. It's now a plant stand, and since I can't afford a new one, I sew by hand. We've come to believe we can't live without technology, and even if we resist the idea that life would be impossible without it, we don't want to give it up. We feel sorry for past generations who had to do hard, tiring work. Even our brains get a break with computers that do fast calculations and entertain us. But the time I spend sewing by hand is not boring, and there are many benefits. I can sew and listen to the radio or talk with family and friends. If it's a simple task, I can watch TV and feel less guilty about sitting in front of it because I'm doing something useful. It's a cozy feeling to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea. I used to think sewing by hand was terrible, imagining long hours and eye strain. But there's something soothing about handcrafting, and it's satisfying to see my work improve. Things get done quickly, and life slows down to the pace of my hands. I'm also free from the rush of modern life, where we hurry from one task to the next. I've taken back control of my sink, where I enjoy washing dishes and daydreaming. Now, I look around the house and wonder if we really need the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. We could save a lot of money by not using electric lights!"

Joanna Watt visits him at his workshop in East London, which is busy with half-made furniture and various planks of wood. Hurst has been in this business for ten years and has a strong reputation. His schedule is always full, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want quality furniture like cupboards, tables, or bookcases, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, but finding one who focuses on clean, simple designs is rare. Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His pursuit of perfection and his talent are key to his success. Hurst is confident in his skills, saying he has a natural ability for making things. He learned his craft by asking the right questions and figuring things out on his own.

Most of Hurst's work comes from private clients, and some return for more pieces. He finds it satisfying to furnish an entire house. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want.

Hurst appreciates other talented craftsmen and acknowledges that some are better than him. He criticizes those who take too long to make a single piece and those who try to make fashion statements with their furniture. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and usable.

Despite his confidence, Hurst is humble about his work. As Joanna leaves, he remarks, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""

It suggests that sleep helps us process and understand the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, learning would be difficult. The third theory is about energy. It says that we need sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who doesn't follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own little quirks. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing angry letters to newspapers about everything. Eccentricity is about showing our uniqueness. Inside us, there is a constant struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong more than we want to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We want to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to be more individualistic and show our personality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then pursue it without giving up, you'll confuse many people."" But this self-conscious individuality is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a socialite makes shocking comments to get noticed, that's not eccentricity. However, if they keep doing these things until they can't go back to what most consider 'normal behavior,' then they might be eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is being natural. Eccentrics don't try to be odd; they just are. True eccentrics don't care about public opinion; they are barely aware of it. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are very aware of the world and react to it. Some want to make an impression, and some want to escape, but they are all aware of society. Only the eccentric continues on their path without concern for what others think."

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've been lucky to meet some of the great thinkers in this field. None of them is more important than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who has been central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field better than anyone else. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But for me, ""The Home of Man"" is Barbara's most important book. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about, like what we now call 'sustainable human development.' I've read many books since, but none match its impact.

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their colony. This book explains animal communication wonderfully with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from seeming chaos to an organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion in this book was inspiring. Ennion's paintings, based on years of observing birds, show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful with just a few lines and colors. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

C. Lee Durrell

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that has influenced me the most. It not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation but also confirmed my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was feeling discouraged by setbacks, but reading this book made my world brighter. It beautifully combines animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done, but I think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family. This idea of interconnectedness is something we all need to understand.

I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. These images captured my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which encouraged me to start sketching them. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images led me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was a stronger subject for me than math or physics, it opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here's what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that most people buy books because of reviews, more than ads, word of mouth, or bookshop displays. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are less upset by bad reviews. They think any mention, good or bad, can boost sales as readers want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are still often ignored. Publishers shouldn't complain too much because reviews are a cheap way to make a book and author known. A good review by a trusted reviewer can increase sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are crucial for literary publishing. Without them, we would struggle. We publish books by lesser-known authors who need reviews to sell because we don't advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Reviews can boost sales, but they need to be combined with other things like word-of-mouth, support from bookshops, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
In Britain, the link between publishing and reviews is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can greatly impact a book's success. Here, bookshops don't always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes years of good reviews for a writer to become popular. Some poorly reviewed books sell well, while others don't. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to buy it after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the surprise choice of reviewer or the review's quality that can persuade people to buy a book."
CAE_2,"The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egyptian times. Today, Graham Smith keeps this tradition alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who still make weathervanes by hand. Each of Graham's designs is unique and made to fit what his customers want. ""This way, I can create a special, personalized item,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something unique that reflects the man's job or hobbies. This is quite different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise gift for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for weathervane designs,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes as a business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. ""My old job didn't have any artistic side, but this is exciting and creative,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing."" Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval for the design before cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are just as popular as the custom ones. ""People like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They like having something a little different."" Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small, rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,"" he explains. ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine."" Graham is getting busier, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. ""The price,"" he explains, ""depends on how detailed the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans earned him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. His year began poorly when a film project called *Life and Limb*, which he had been working on for months, suddenly failed. He was worried because he hadn't made any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to keep his bank manager happy. A sensible person in Evans' situation might have found a job. He could have returned to being a TV executive or started a TV project he had paused. Instead, he made a risky decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.

Although this decision was impulsive, the idea for the story had been with him for a while. It started when he met a farrier on Dartmoor who told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These men were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was fascinated and began researching the topic to write a screenplay. But after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead.

In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was watching people, but I felt alone and like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written half of the book. The bank manager was pressuring him, and he needed to know if it was worth continuing. He showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and guessed Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more than that to pay off some debt and support his family. He had spent seven months on the book and needed at least two more. $30,000 was not enough. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next was remarkable. Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

The studios agreed to pay this amount, and they each presented their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four top filmmakers called, one after the other, to ask for the chance to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He said he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He would be involved, but from a distance. The success of his novel also brought new support for *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is trying to make a comeback in the world of chess, but age is not on his side. Chess has become a game for younger players. After 20 years away from the game, Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game with a brilliant move, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, he is 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer himself helped make chess more popular, leading to a new era of professional chess. Now, the focus is on winning, and players need strong nerves and stamina, as well as intelligence. The pressure in chess is very high. Players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose the game. Games are longer now, and many are played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Among the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30.

The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board, with players preparing extensively before matches. Computers have had a big impact on chess. A small computer can store a million chess games and help players study their opponents. In some matches, players have teams working to find weaknesses in their opponent's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now studied in great detail, and being well-prepared can decide the outcome.

Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money around the world. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused the whole time. Losing concentration can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the tension, especially during the final moments of the game when players have only seconds to make their moves. This is a time of intense pressure, where nerves and determination are key.

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and relief. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess masters must be ready to compete every day, as most tournaments last 9-11 days. There is a year-round tournament circuit, and world championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10kg during the match.

Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long break from chess after 1972 hard to understand, but it also made him a legend. If Fischer has returned for the money, he will earn a lot. But if he truly believes he can still be the best, the result could be disappointing."

Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is a playwright with three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a film script. ""It's a low-budget project, but we're not sure how low,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Interestingly, before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he admits. ""It's set in a car, which I wouldn't do now because of the challenges. I knew nothing back then."" Nick left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Being around like-minded people was the first time I enjoyed an educational environment. It was very inspiring.""

**B. Simon Pegg**  
Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has progressed significantly since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and recently completed a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard, even performing in comedy clubs during his university days. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""Steve saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed me imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C. Ciaran McMenamin**  
Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show received great reviews, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was destined for success. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I realized I wanted to pursue it because I was good at it and loved it."" Now, he is waiting for more recognition but is thoughtful about fame. ""At 18, you think you'll love the attention, but you soon realize it's not why you act. It's about earning respect for good work.""

**D. Neil Taylor**  
Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to become very popular when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company has high expectations, but I don't know what to expect. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was performing at student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times I was very discouraged, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E. Stephen Richards**  
Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many prizes and awards. He is well-known on the poetry circuit, where he has been performing for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that couldn't be a poem,"" he says. Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with a theater job, I decided to go."" After university, he published a children's book in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because I read a lot as a child."" With his poetry being praised, moving to novels is a bold step. ""Poetry has a structure, so there's less chance of making mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for errors. My main goal is to avoid producing work without caring about its quality."""

However, she worries that her bony knees might ruin her chances. Despite this, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'

B. This story is about the beginning and near-end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old Ford cars, and the radio.

C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. So, when successful professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he naturally shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she also wants his help for her brother, who is in prison unfairly. However, the most interesting part is how the author solves these problems. The story is funny and smart, making it a very enjoyable read.

D. Two pairs of best friends, two women and two men, meet in London during the 1960s and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of the four, an American businessman named James Hudson, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is excellent. This book is long and detailed, allowing readers to really get to know the characters.

E. This story, written by a top American fiction writer, is both funny and touching. It tells how Ian Bedloe, feeling guilty for a mistake, becomes the 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an odd bachelor surrounded by the mess of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the sweet relationship Ian builds with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and lovely book with a perfect mix of sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. Volunteer tourists might help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could hire more workers than a single volunteer could replace. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack technical skills or professional experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are truly motivated by a desire to help others or if they are more interested in gaining experiences that will benefit their careers. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and considerate of less fortunate people in their future careers and lives.

**B.** Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and more participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also create international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the benefits for both volunteers and host communities can contribute to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by people from wealthier areas, it might only give these privileged individuals a broader perspective and career advantages, without significantly helping the communities they visit. These volunteers might use the experience to advance personally, rather than truly benefiting the host communities.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity by wealthy Westerners. It can also be a straightforward way to provide technical help for development. At its best, it benefits both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for an exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of wanting to help others through personal actions. These efforts, aimed at making a small difference, can seem positive in a world that often distrusts politics. The personal approach avoids big government and business, but it also skips the democratic process and reduces development to individual charity acts. While volunteering is a commendable act, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can degrade the true meaning of development. The politics of volunteer tourism can shift focus away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help us get out of bed. That's where the clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, which included me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The first model has a 'dual alarm function,' but it doesn't work as expected. You can't use it to snooze and then wake up again. Instead, it's meant for setting two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and another for weekends. However, not everyone needs this feature. This model is priced similarly to the second one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a nice bonus. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but the device is quite large, about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone, so he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was the most attractive and was our overall favorite. Paul Bridges said he 'fell in love with it,' although the clock on his test model kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which was a problem when I finally looked at the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't have to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner. We all liked this feature, but setting it up was complicated, though we felt 'cool' and sophisticated once we figured it out.

Tom Granger thought the model with an extra built-in lamp was 'unbelievably tacky.' You have to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, which made him question the quality. He had to read the instructions twice to get it working, as the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light is hard to position and only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer is loud and reminded me of a submarine alarm, making me want to throw it across the room. Despite this, it's the third most popular model on the market.

Aimed at young people, this model has a bright casing and a matching strap, which appealed to Tom Granger and me. 'I would choose this one because it stands out,' he said. The traditional controls made it the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes, either early or late. Paul Bridges found this unacceptable and called the model 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it was 'standard and took up little space.' It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found more intuitive. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed the buttons correctly, so you can't trust it to work. He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was basic, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model was effective; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small animal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not originally from America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, making their spines stick out to protect them. This defense works well if the hedgehog has many spines. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have adapted to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice.

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in sports is challenging for everyone, but women often face extra difficulties. They have to train hard and make sacrifices, leaving little time for a normal life. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming obstacles and setting new records. Here, we talk to some talented British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

""I love the feeling of flying through the air and landing smoothly, but it can be scary. Sometimes the weather is bad, but you just have to keep going. It's hard to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You miss out on social life and friends, but it's my choice. In the British team, there are six men and three women. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won because I was the fastest, even though I had never cycled before! As a professional, I'm well paid, and there are opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry people might think I succeed because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling now, rather than making money. I train at least four hours a day, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitment.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

""Rowing is hard for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most start at 19 or 20, making it tough to succeed internationally. Coaches often stay for only a year, so there's no consistency, and the women's squad is disorganized. But it's fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was stubborn and disliked being controlled. Now, I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience—50 miles and 21 hours a day with only three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, as my sponsorship money was running out. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as risky.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

""Some men have big egos when driving—you see it on motorways. When I do well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its downsides. At corners, men think, 'I have to beat her,' so I've had many collisions! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I make goes back into racing. Women have raced since the 1920s and were seen as eccentric. It's great that more women are racing now. I love aiming for perfection and trying to complete a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

""I wake up at 5:30 a.m. three times a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous energy before a race, and you push yourself hard. I've often asked why I do it. The reasons are: a) I'm happier when fit, b) I'm naturally lazy and need to push myself, c) racing is social. Men and women usually compete together, but media coverage focuses mostly on men. Prize money isn't as good for women, but we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission to work on this."""
CAE_34,"Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was an 18-year-old student. He was traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van before starting university. While in Cannes, he ran out of money and got a job painting boats. One day, he saw Picasso having lunch at a restaurant in the harbor. Picasso was a famous artist who usually kept to himself, so Richard was surprised to see him there with his wife and friends.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and even added a drawing to the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, using an American woman at the table as an interpreter because Picasso's English was not good.

After showing the autograph to his friend, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, he started sketching Picasso, who playfully made funny faces to make it difficult for Richard. Eventually, Picasso stopped moving and allowed Richard to draw him properly. Richard noticed how youthful and intense Picasso's eyes were, despite his age.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the drawing. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and then added his own quick drawing to the page. He humorously altered Richard's portrait, making it look like a character from one of his playful artworks. Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature.

Looking back, Richard feels lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. It was a memorable experience for him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here, we explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. To highlight this, they often place fruits, vegetables, or house plants at the store entrance. They might also have an in-store bakery, so the smell of fresh bread fills the air. The store's colors, like green, can also make things seem fresher. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't fit this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

Where products are placed in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With technology, supermarkets know which areas customers visit most. They place high-profit or fast-selling items there. Products at eye level sell better, so manufacturers want their items on these shelves. Special offers in ""dump bins"" attract bargain hunters. Stores also use ""complementation,"" like placing salad dressings near salads or desserts near ice cream.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place basic items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This way, customers pass by more expensive items on their way. Similarly, chain stores put popular products far from the entrance, trusting loyal customers will find them and see other tempting products along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from stacking items high and selling them cheap. Instead, they display fewer items to make them seem exclusive. This strategy is about good store design as much as it is about the clothes themselves.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total bill rather than individual prices. Supermarkets use this by mixing low-profit staples with high-profit items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as ""loss leaders."" More often, they buy in bulk or meet sales targets to get discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, customers buy fewer items and notice individual prices more. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing also helps reduce theft, as staff must record the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully plan their lighting. Chain stores aim for natural light so customers see the true color of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look better.

**H. Walk This Way**

Chain stores use different carpets to guide customers. One pattern marks the main paths, and another marks sales areas. This ""Yellow Brick Road"" approach isn't always successful, as some shoppers stick to the main paths. Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths, leading to more inviting carpeted sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

When you enter a supermarket, you might see large photos of delicious food, which can be tempting if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets use ""video trolleys"" with screens that show ads as you shop. Sensors trigger ads based on where you are, like showing a ready-made meal ad near the chilled food section. These trolleys target impulse buyers and reportedly boost sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, aged 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-69, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in a book called ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris contacted Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris the basics of sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while, then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went ashore to practice climbing. The climb was challenging, but Robin impressed Chris with his calmness in difficult situations. At one point, they reached a big drop, and Chris showed Robin how to climb down safely. Robin, used to climbing down ropes on his boat, managed to lower himself safely.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin developed a strong friendship. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin's leadership. Although the skipper usually makes all the decisions, Robin involved everyone in the decision-making process. Chris found the sailing part of the trip boring and challenging, as he preferred being on land. Robin, on the other hand, enjoyed working on the boat and fixing things. Chris sometimes felt useless, which was difficult for him. The yacht was crowded, with six people on a boat meant for four, unlike a mountain expedition where you can have some space.

When they reached Greenland, Chris led the climbing part of the expedition. He found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety, as a fall could have been dangerous for both of them. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tougher than Chris expected. Robin, not a natural climber, impressed Chris with his determination. On their first attempt, they climbed for 24 hours straight, and on the way down, they were so tired they almost fell asleep on steep slopes. Despite the challenges, Robin trusted Chris completely and was willing to try climbing the mountain again, even though he was worried about the boat.

The only time their friendship was tested was on the way back home. They took turns keeping watch on the yacht. Chris was supposed to take over at 4 am, but Robin let him sleep, thinking he could handle it himself. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin quickly reassured him that it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland expedition, Chris realized that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, people spat out apple seeds, and 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but most didn't suit the British climate. The Normans brought better varieties, and British monks continued to develop new apples. Many Western apples today come from these varieties.

**Medieval Apples (1200)**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, named for its pear-like shape, was a main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the late 1600s, giving us the word 'costermonger' for street fruit sellers. Apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and wars. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple growing. Harris brought back grafts, including the famous Pippins, and started a modern orchard in Kent.

**Apples Abroad (1750)**  
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed,' planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was seen as a medicine man by Native Americans and became a folk hero.

**Modern Apples (1850)**  
Around this time in Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from a dead tree's roots. He named the apple 'Hawkey,' and it was later called 'Delicious' after a judge tasted it. It became one of the most popular apples worldwide. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith discovered another famous apple. Known as 'Granny Smith,' she found a new apple tree in 1868 and grew the first major crop of green apples, which became famous globally.

**Uniformity Concerns (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their appearance and ability to travel rather than taste. This lack of variety is reducing the gene pool. While UK gardeners have preserved many old varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now asking for more variety. We need to protect natural diversity in apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located in Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya, and has been his base for winter training for three years. However, he had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until his fourth visit. During this trip, he participated in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in a World Championship race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. This was a great opportunity for him.

Training at high altitudes helps produce more red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity. This has contributed to the success of many Kenyan runners. Richard's first race in Africa was an international cross-country race in Nairobi, the first of its kind on the continent. Although he finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, he felt he had performed well.

Richard believes that Kenyan success is not just due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to running, with an effortless style, a basic diet, and a love for competition. The key to their success might be their training methods. At the national team training camp, located at St Mark's College on Mount Kenya, athletes live simply, sharing rooms and focusing on their training.

Their daily routine includes three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon, covering about 40 kilometers each day. Sundays are easier, with only a 20-kilometer run. Life at the camp is uncomplicated, with simple meals and basic facilities. After training, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers.

By the end of his stay, Richard appreciated Kenyan success even more. He realized that their achievements are not just due to genetics, upbringing, or altitude. The simple lifestyle, tough training, and passion for success are likely the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard. The main issue is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers still think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become more fragmented. Major brand campaigns should focus on smaller, specific audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but many of these won't be advertised brands. You might buy several of the same brand, but out of the 15,000 products available, you only purchase a few advertised ones. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For bigger items like cars, you might buy one every three years, and it might even be provided by your employer. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even when you include things like candy, medicine, and services, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Now, compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. If we focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising, the average person buys only 400 of them, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4%. So, the old saying that half of advertising is wasted might be wrong; it could be 96% that's wasted, but no one knows which part.

When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16, or 6%. The rest, 94%, seem wasted. You might think you're not influenced by ads, but most people think that too. The truth is, people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. It's unrealistic to think everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the few who will respond, because advertisers can't know in advance who will be interested. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with many people. But all waste is unpleasant. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who might respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns don't get a 100% response.

This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. That can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media; they could contact those people directly. This applies to all types of ads, from personal announcements to soft drink commercials. An advertiser who gains one million new customers (2% of the adult population) is doing well. For example, the top-selling soap powder brands would be thrilled with a million new customers. Any campaign that wins over 2% of the population is very successful, but that's still a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Solar Survivor Charles Clover explores Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It blends with the town's nineteenth-century buildings and was approved by planners even though it's in a conservation area. The solar-powered doorbell is silent, and the house is super-insulated with triple-glazed windows filled with krypton gas, making it very quiet inside. Once inside, you must take off your shoes, and there is a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it ventilates the house. Vale opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to the environment since the 1970s. They wrote a book on green architecture called The Autonomous House. They designed a building that emits no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They created composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to protect drinking water, which is filtered before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they don't use a dishwasher to avoid strong detergents. Most features of the house are designed to be environmentally friendly. 'We wanted to show that it's possible to design a house that is less harmful to the environment without living in the dark,' says Robert. 'It wouldn't be medieval.' The only medieval aspect is the aesthetic: the hall, with the hearth and staircase, rises the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills, and last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is what other four-bedroom houses use on top of heating. Soon, the house will use even less electricity when solar panels and generating equipment are installed in the garden. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will generate extra electricity. There will even be enough to charge an electric car one day. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales rarely use. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room temperature was 18C, which is comfortable because there are no draughts or heat loss. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady in the early 1900s was comfortable at 12.5C because of her clothing's insulation. Robert suggests people in old houses should live like people did back then, but this idea might not catch on. The house's secret is its simplicity, with little to go wrong. Most materials were bought from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making the house cheap to build, costing the same per square metre as low-cost housing for rent. Commercial building companies are resisting this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a logical person, almost like a scientist. However, in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were real evidence that fairies existed. He published these photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simple trick challenges the idea that a camera always tells the truth. In fact, it can lie, and it always could. Today, we are familiar with using computer software to change our digital images, and it's a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, when cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Text: 'Blacksmiths Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and those who work with it, blacksmiths, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they were the only ones who could make weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the elaborate ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were always made by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, these skills were almost lost because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs. In the past 10 years, there has been a revival due to more interest in decorative architecture and a more open-minded approach to interior design. Still, much of the work seems old-fashioned: makers of gates and balconies often describe their products as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. You can't enter a trendy design store without seeing rusty candlesticks with hanging decorations. Fortunately, there are other options, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmiths' craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says: 'We might be at the start of a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.' Power tools have freed blacksmiths from hard work over a hot anvil, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld metal more easily. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.' About 250 pieces have been made for the show, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, 'but a percentage of every sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork,' says Dawson. His own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. 'My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,' he says. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler by training, says, 'It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes really hard and unmovable again.' Ann Catrin Evans' steel door-knockers and handles seem inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And it feels like it will last forever.' No other common metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are high, as long as we don't have to see any more rusty candlesticks, that is.'"
CAE_14,"Title: THE DAY I QUIT SMOKING

When I quit smoking, I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was really angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to a non-smoker in just four hours, and I found it strange myself.

The session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to quit and didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking campaigns, and I still am. I had low blood pressure, a healthy family, and I didn't feel sick. I even thought I recovered from colds faster than my health-conscious friends.

On a regular Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking in Birmingham to write an article about others trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't be trying to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, so I didn't expect their method to work on me. I actually enjoyed smoking; it gave me pleasure. The counselor seemed to understand this.

We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when we were told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. The messages about quitting made sense to me. Just as smoking had been a challenge against opposition, quitting started to feel appealing. The idea of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, which felt like hunger, faded after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I couldn't meet deadlines without nicotine, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, spending weekend mornings at home was the hardest part, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was an activity itself.

Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is different, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, believes she should be a household name. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When Ferry started her research, she looked into scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin's suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, a close friend and fellow scientist who also opposed nuclear weapons. However, Ferry found no biographies of Pauling in her local bookshop, which surprised her. Pauling was a major chemist of the 20th century and won Nobel Prizes in both chemistry and peace, yet he was not well-known in Britain.

Some scientists, like the late Peter Medawar, have said that scientists' lives are often dull to read about. This view might explain why publishers and booksellers are not eager to promote scientific biographies. There is a belief in the literary world that there is a big gap between understanding the arts and sciences. As a result, only the most famous scientists are featured in bookshops.

However, scientists do not lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists avoid media attention to maintain their credibility. For example, a leading geneticist once said he did not want to be quoted or photographed to avoid being seen as self-promoting. This attitude can give a false impression of science and discourage young people from pursuing it.

Fortunately, this is changing. Scientists are now appearing in public in different ways. For instance, Professor Richard Dawkins presents TV quiz prizes, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on TV. These activities help people see scientists as relatable individuals.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be scholarly and dull, often ignoring the scientist's personal life. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which was both funny and touching. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie are shown with their flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin was passionate about her scientific work. She solved the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964. She also had three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life may not seem directly related to her work, but it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.

Hodgkin's life is interesting not just for her science but also for how she managed her personal and professional life. Communicating the passion for scientific inquiry is challenging for biographers because many readers lack the scientific background to understand complex ideas. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort. It's unfortunate that many educated people are unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, ask for her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers, but to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

This skill, known as dowsing, involves finding water, minerals, or lost objects underground. There are many ideas about how dowsing works. Some people think it involves physical forces like magnetism, while others believe it is more spiritual. A popular theory is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers, like Margaret, might be very good at sensing these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.

In recent years, droughts have kept the Wilkins busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of Margaret's clients are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other clients include people with remote holiday homes and golf-course developers who need water for their facilities.

Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She avoids drilling where farm waste could contaminate the water. The water she finds flows through cracks in solid rock, which helps keep it clean. However, in Cornwall, where they work, there is a lot of iron, so they have to be careful. They also need electricity to power the pump, so the well should be near existing power lines.

To find water on large properties like golf courses, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map, and it swings when it is over an area with water. After identifying possible spots, she walks the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation and uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. She holds the stick's forks and pulls them slightly apart. When water is directly below, the stick's straight part rises. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates, as even a small mistake can miss the water. Her husband also checks the area, and they only drill if they agree on the spot.

Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition in England. Many people are interested in this mysterious ability. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This might explain why she is so good at finding water. Without this 'sixth sense', it would be hard for her family to make a living from their well-drilling business year after year."

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people, which was very different from her hometown. She had to learn quickly how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It seemed easy for the other waitresses, but Amanda struggled and ended up dropping the drinks. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed it off, saying everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line of customers had formed outside, and Amanda felt nervous. Luckily, the orders were automated, so she didn't have to remember them. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she found the loud music hard to handle. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised to hear it had been a 'quiet' day. Amanda realized that waitressing is tiring and requires a bubbly personality and the ability to stay calm with many customers. She didn't like the pay and didn't receive any tips. She was happy to return to her children, finding it easier than waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a 'mum' for the day. She thought she could handle Amanda's cheeky daughters, but it was more challenging than she expected. After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls, drop Sophie at school, and Katie at nursery. She thought she would have some free time, but Amanda left a note with chores like making beds, cleaning, and doing laundry. After picking up Katie and shopping, she brought Sophie home, and the girls started jumping on the sofa and screaming. Cindy tried to stay calm, hoping they would tire out, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. She didn't realize how tiring it was to care for two small children and felt the heavy responsibility. Despite this, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher. On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was unsure about what to wear to school. At assembly, she faced about 400 pupils and hoped to blend in. She helped with a maths class where children worked in groups, which was different from her school days. She also assisted with a nature project involving snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but found teachers only have a short break. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced on her, revealing her rusty French. Finally, they had Physical Education, and Rosemary was exhausted, but the children were full of energy. She found speaking in front of the class challenging. Despite teachers having more holidays, she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, sold in shops and restaurants. Hilary spent the morning bottling milk and packaging ice cream. It was hard to resist tasting the treats. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe, which could die if left for more than 12 hours. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The hardest part was not being able to take time off, as the cows need milking daily. Rosemary only gets about three days of holiday a year. Farming seems romantic, but it's tough, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without a musical background. Hakan Hardenberger, the only child of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a standout trumpet player by the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new compositions. When you meet him, he appears youthful and energetic, much like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature highlighted his work and growth, filmed in both the UK and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo, and his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music despite not being musical himself, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother contacted the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, to teach her son. Nilsson, a rising musician, immediately recognized Hardenberger's talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher from the start, someone who was passionate about the trumpet and eager to connect with other players worldwide.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument with imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly the same. He believes in understanding these imperfections and working with them. From a young age, he had the ability to find the right balance and develop his unique sound. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances, and collected all his records.

His parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and risky, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special ability to connect with audiences. Thibaud encouraged him to enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger only prepared for the first round but advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and noticed that people listened to him, even if he thought he ""played like a pig.""

Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. He feels the power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**A.** The story of Tristan Smith takes place in the made-up country of Efica. It's a unique tale about human power, history, and humor. The author has skillfully created a world with its own history and traditions. The book is known for its humor and the author's special way of seeing things, combined with deep psychological insight. It's a challenging but rewarding read.

**B.** Harriet is a middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she wouldn't meet someone like Sheila, who is from a working-class background and takes care of her elderly father and grandson, Leo. Their lives change when Leo attacks Harriet's son, Joe. After the court case, neither boy talks about the incident. Leo, who was a good student and never fought before, won't say why he did it. Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him consumes her life. Sheila feels guilty and asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author is great at showing how people deal with big changes in their lives and captures the feeling that no matter how hard a mother tries, it never seems enough.

**C.** This book, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most remote Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. It connects this story with important moments in Scottish history, imagined through the dreams of the young main character, Thorfinn Ragnarson. He disappears at one point but returns after World War II, having learned to value the simple lives of his ancestors.

**D.** After a recent successful book, the author has written a sequel with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life is still a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness. Rosie helps her in her enjoyable manipulation of suitors and friends. By the end, Aurora realizes that time has passed and a new generation is taking over. The author is good at showing the hidden sadness in ordinary life and focuses more on the subtle aspects of human activity than the obvious ones.

CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers: Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and their daily routines.**

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY:**  
Anne wakes up at 6:30 am, goes to the gym at 7 am, and starts work by 8 am. She begins operating at 8:30 am on Mondays, Wednesdays, and some Friday afternoons. Most surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. Sometimes, she works for ten hours without a break. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. While she doesn't feel stressed during surgery, she sometimes worries about the next day's tasks. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but successful operations are very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, she runs an out-patient clinic, explaining operations to patients. She enjoys this part of her job, although time constraints can make it hard to comfort upset patients. Anne leaves work between 6 pm and 8 pm. She is on call some nights and weekends, always carrying her pager. On holidays, she worries about her patients for the first few days and dreams about operating at night. She finds it difficult to relax.

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY:**  
Marita gets up at 7:45 am, leaves home by 8:20 am, and arrives at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, her team meets to discuss their projects and any issues. Her team includes three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of her work is design; the rest is production. She receives a brief from the client and spends three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting her ideas to the client and getting approval, she works on estimates and budgets, and hires photographers and illustrators. She coordinates with printers to ensure everything is on schedule. Managing people and multiple projects can be stressful, with deadlines always approaching. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, often at a pub, or she eats sandwiches while working. It's satisfying when clients like her designs, but disappointing when projects are rejected. She gets home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later, and finds it hard to unwind.

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY:**  
Linda usually wakes up at 7 am, but on days she meets early flights, she gets up between 4:30 am and 5 am. Around 10:30 or 11 am, she might go for a bike ride or swim. Since driving is a sedentary job, she watches her diet and exercises regularly. She has a big breakfast and snacks during the day. Clients often ask for recommendations on restaurants and shops, so she needs to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing her to plan routes. Not all passengers are polite, but most are well-behaved, and she has good relationships with regular clients. She sometimes overhears conversations in the car but stays focused on driving. The press has tried to get her to talk about clients, but she refuses. Linda works seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and tries to be in bed by 11 pm.

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY:**  
Tracy gets up at 7 am, leaves home at 7:30 am, and starts her first job. She and her assistant mainly maintain gardens they have designed. They do some commercial work, but mostly private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each. Around 11 am, they take a break for a big breakfast at a cafe. In summer, she may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. Her business office is at home, where she checks messages and returns calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, she arranges evening consultations. They use old materials and unusual plants to create gardens that look aged. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren't appealing, but it's satisfying to see a garden completed and blooming. Tracy finds it hard to relax in the evenings because she can hear the business phone. She sleeps well because the physical work is tiring. The job is tough but allows for creativity.

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY:**  
Zena arrives at the construction site by 8:30 am. As an assistant resident engineer, she oversees the building of bridges and a retaining wall. She ensures contractors follow the schedule, safety rules, and minimize environmental impact. She coordinates site professionals and solves problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so she first checks with the clerk of works about any updates. Her day involves reacting to this information, handling paperwork, and answering design questions. Lunch is usually a quick half-hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm. When contractors are on break, it's easier for her to inspect the site. Checking their work can cause tension, so she maintains open communication. She meets the duty resident engineer daily but acts immediately if urgent issues arise. Zena leaves the site around 6 pm and is always on call."
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I handle customer programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards program in major European markets. I need to stay in touch with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then reply to emails. I manage all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future projects. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes 10 to 20 demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important to the artists. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly work-related, and I often get home at 1:00 am, where I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, buying from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with a full-time restorer and coordinate with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette during coffee breaks to stay updated on the business and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm and it takes about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work set shifts, leaving home at 6:00 am for early shifts. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before switching stations. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4:00 am. It's crucial to be alert, so I don't hesitate to take sick leave if needed. The job is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I aim to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect me to gather many books based on reviews. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' representatives visit, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure timely delivery. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Twice a week, I work a late shift, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I quickly gather stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, and make any changes before they go live. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but it's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**

A good leader is someone who inspires others and brings about change. They guide people forward. Leadership isn't about your background or how tall you are, as some early theories suggested. It's not just about being smart, either. Pat Dixon, who wrote ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is crucial, and to share it with others, a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says it's about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Discovering Leadership Potential**

John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing, developing, and using these hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it might be harder to see it in our own workplaces. Yet, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

**C. Reflecting on Leadership Styles**

Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and kept information from you, blaming you when things went wrong. The first was a true leader; the second just managed poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**

Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" says a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**

Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:

- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you're passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and take action.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you're usually a negotiator, try taking charge. See how this changes the outcome.
- Set goals and exceed them. Look at your job and identify where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career prospects.

**F. Developing Leadership**

- Leadership doesn't just happen. It develops by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.
- Don't assume your leadership style will immediately win over colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and how you can help others become leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of Andrew Marton's version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his tough relationship with his sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's has its highlights. The flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife is more intense than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer films. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, a sneaky politician causing chaos. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, as an acrobat-turned-swordsman, adds a moody touch but still shines. The film uses costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film is visually detailed but feels like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is harsh when evicting tenants. The story focuses on his tense relationship with his son, but the filmmakers seem more interested in the period details than the dark story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings it back to life. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck features 'forty-eight international stars' and is directed by four directors with 23,000 extras. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, feel slow for both the characters and the audience. Logistically, it’s impressive, but it’s meant for the big screen. On video, it loses some of its impact."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a gripping story. The narrator is a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We always believe he will solve the mystery. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful.

**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, helping his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and understanding of human behavior make this mystery entertaining.

**BOOK F**  
In ""Blood Red, Snow White,"" written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, a lawyer defends a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book mixes romance, money, and violence to create an engaging suspense novel.

**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels his career is not going well. Although Shaw usually entertains, this book is not as strong as his previous works.

**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" by Lawrence Gough is his best book in a while. Canadian police are after a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"At 34, Tim Pozzi decided to leave his good job to go backpacking. He wonders why he and others his age are making this big decision. This summer, he quit his job, rented out his apartment, and planned to travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think he's lucky, but he's 34 and feeling nervous. It's not his first time traveling; after university, he spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When he returned, he wanted to do it again someday. But life happened—he fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, he realized he was giving up his personal happiness for money. When he resigned, he felt like he was taking control of his life again. Now, he has no ties. Many of his friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with him, they envy his freedom. He's not in a relationship and has no strong career goals, so he feels he should make the most of his freedom, partly for his friends' sake.

Why is he nervous? First, he has to make all the necessary arrangements. How will he feel about someone else living in his home? How will he organize the rental? And he needs to decide where to go. He's a big procrastinator and is already weeks behind his schedule. He told himself, ""Might as well enjoy the summer in England,"" and then, ""Why not stay for the start of the football season?"" Cutting emotional ties makes it harder. He's delaying because he wonders if he can still handle backpacking. Can he adjust to a simpler way of life? Will he fit in with younger backpackers? Maybe he will. More Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives behind and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people are realizing they can have adventures if they're brave, organized, and confident enough.

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny is willing to give up job security for the trip. He worries about not moving up the career ladder, but he thinks it's a risk worth taking. When he left his office, he threw his calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!

For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a time of change. In the military, there's a set way of doing things. He needed to change this approach to have a normal life as a civilian. There are many reasons to travel at this stage in life, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says the workforce is more flexible now. More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose. Some big companies even have career-break policies. They prefer employees to take a break and return rather than leave for a competitor.

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that publishes stories of ordinary travelers, says more people in their thirties are rethinking their lives. If you're not happy with your job, it's not about just sticking with it anymore. People know there are opportunities, and a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess and think about your life.

Is this wanderlust just a sign that people can't handle adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn't think so. She believes it's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society where people want a balanced life. Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. He feels he's running towards something he wants. But he does feel nervous about leaving behind his comfortable routine, like going to the office every day and having coffee with colleagues.

Tim shares Ben's concerns about leaving a stable life with few challenges. He's not sure he would be traveling if he hadn't found his boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, there's often a catalyst, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel. It took a push for Tim to start moving, but now he's excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, he'll be proud of taking this step. And in that, he speaks for all older backpackers."
CAE_42,"Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from her journalism career and felt disconnected from the technological changes. She shares how she turned her home into an efficient workplace. When she turned 37, she realized she needed to restart her journalism career, which seemed outdated. Her resume showed she was stuck in the 1980s, using typewriters with carbon paper. She felt unqualified for jobs requiring desktop publishing skills, which she didn't have. She was a technophobe, confused by even simple gadgets like pocket calculators and video timers. 

Faced with a career gap, she decided to act quickly. She entered a local newspaper competition and surprisingly won a computer package for her family. They received a laptop for her husband and a personal computer for everyone. They quickly adapted to new terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing. The family started chatting online with people worldwide. The children stopped watching TV, and Georgina set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem for internet access. This setup allowed her to work from home and still take the children to school. 

The children were comfortable with computers from school, but Georgina was hesitant, fearing she might lose her work by pressing the wrong button. However, she learned the basic skills and found it logical and easy. With perseverance, she learned more each day. She started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month, and felt she had the best of both worlds. 

The computer helped her become organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets helped track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads saved time. For a journalist, being online meant she could research stories, ask for information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide. 

However, working from home had downsides, like isolation from people and household distractions. There were also arguments over computer use when the children were home. Despite this, more people were buying multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and work. In her neighborhood, a new type of home-based industry was emerging, avoiding the daily commute to the city. 

A report on PC usage in UK homes described the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated, with 93% owning a personal computer, 32% having a CD-ROM, 38% a laser printer, and 50% a modem. Georgina felt ahead of the curve and hoped to one day email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publish her own magazine from home. It seemed that the possibilities were endless."

The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh has modern buildings that look very different from the historic area around them. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see if the inside was as impressive as the outside. The museum is hard to miss with its large, yellow sandstone tower and unique design. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building's architecture, with some praising it as a masterpiece and others not liking it at all. Now, as the museum is about to open, the exhibitions inside are expected to get similar reactions.

The museum tells the story of Scotland with many interesting objects, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel. It has a timeline to help visitors understand the history, but it doesn't overwhelm them with too much national pride. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to visit more than once. Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no imaginative recreations of the past. Instead, the museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some multimedia to tell the stories of the objects.

Inside the museum, the spaces are impressive, with galleries of different sizes and shapes. The walls look like large stone blocks, and there are deep display cases. Natural light comes in through narrow windows and from the roof, creating a pleasant atmosphere to explore the exhibits. The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a hands-on center for kids.

On the top floor, there is a Twentieth Century gallery, which is the only temporary exhibition. It features objects chosen by Scottish people and other personalities that have impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. The Prime Minister suggested an electric guitar, while others chose televisions, Thermos flasks, and favorite toys. Although the idea is fun, it might seem less serious until the computer system with personal stories and memories is ready next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can vividly show the past. The modern architecture of the museum works well from the inside, but whether it fits the historic location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"The end of print newspapers might take longer than expected. The word ""transition"" suggests a smooth change, but moving newspapers online is not so simple. Many people think print newspapers will eventually disappear because their sales are dropping, while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales fall by 8% to 10% in a year, but their online visits are rising.

However, the situation is more complex. A report from the World Association of Newspapers shows that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, thanks to growth in Asia, even though sales in the West declined. News magazines also saw a 5.4% increase. Similarly, while e-readers like Kindle are popular, the sales of physical books only dropped by 0.4%.

The idea that young people are abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe show different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it's just 3.1%.

In the past, experts thought online advertising would support digital newspapers, but this hasn't happened. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access, but the best way to attract paying readers is to offer both print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print advertising earns much more money than online ads.

Maintaining both print and online editions is challenging and costly for newspapers. However, print still gives newspapers a strong presence, which is harder to achieve online."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well can be challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.

**A. Grouping People**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or take the photo from a higher angle.

**B. Posing for Pictures**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff and awkward. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first, and might feel flattered. However, they may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away, making the interest lie elsewhere.

**D. Eye Contact**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don't have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny or unexpected to get a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something within the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the subject. A laughing child can make the viewer smile, while a sad expression can evoke sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. Situation Interest**

While close-up shots of faces are impactful, the background can add interest and information. When using a background, exclude irrelevant details or blur them. Ensure the subject isn't overshadowed by the background. A wide-angle lens can make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**

When people are talking, arguing, or working together, there are chances for great photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams can make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a hand on the arm. Capture reactions with animated expressions or gestures.

**I. People and Places**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places they visit. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come closer to the camera, so they form a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help balance the subjects and the place.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are just formal poses. Candid pictures of events are more lively, and you can capture natural shots when you know the subject well. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist who specializes in trompe-l'oeil, a style of painting that tricks the eye into seeing a three-dimensional scene. In this interview with Joanna Watt, Sarah shares her thoughts on her art and career.

Unlike many artists, Sarah doesn't sign her work unless asked. She believes the art itself is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and sometimes acts as if her paintings create themselves. This humility makes her a challenging interview subject. She admits, ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" and is uncomfortable being photographed.

However, once she relaxes, the interview becomes engaging and funny. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't fulfill her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart, who introduced her to trompe-l'oeil. This sparked her passion, and she started her own business, feeling she was on the right path.

Sarah's skills in observation and attention to detail, developed through illustration, are crucial for trompe-l'oeil. She believes that no one can teach this art; it's about observing life. She insists she's still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well stop.""

Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, like her struggle to paint bread realistically, and her difficulties with math. When working on a large project for a chapel ceiling, she doubted herself, thinking, ""You're not Michelangelo.""

Despite her self-doubt, Sarah's work stands out. She has completed many important projects for both companies and private clients. Her art often draws inspiration from architecture, like a dining room painted to look like a Venetian palace or a corridor painting that creates the illusion of extra rooms.

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must first trick the viewer and then engage their imagination. She believes the art should be personal to the client and enjoys collaborating with them to create ideas. Many clients become friends because she spends so much time with them during projects.

Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who trust her creativity. They are happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she downplays her talent. She repeats, ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" and prefers her work to be subtle. But her art is anything but boring, and it deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

**A** The way we are evaluated at work is changing. It's not just about how smart we are or our training, but also how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging people is important for deciding who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who might excel and who might not. These skills are crucial for future job opportunities. Unlike what we learned in school, doing well in exams doesn't matter much here. This new measure assumes we all have enough intelligence and technical skills. Instead, it focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are known as emotional intelligence.

**B** In today's world, job security is uncertain, and the idea of a 'job' is changing to 'portable skills'. Personal qualities are becoming more important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills' in the past, but now we understand them better as 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage our own and others' emotions, and using emotions to guide our actions. At work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some think it means just 'being nice', but sometimes it requires being honest and direct. It doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely, but managing them so they help people work well together towards a common goal.

**C** More businesses are realizing that emotional intelligence is important for management. The more complex the job, the more these skills matter. A lack of emotional intelligence can limit the use of technical skills or intelligence. While some people succeed despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more complex and team-oriented, companies that foster these skills have an advantage. In today's workplace, which values teamwork and customer focus, emotional intelligence is essential for success everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people generally get better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills over time. This growth is often called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can develop these skills to help us succeed, especially when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence isn't a magic solution for struggling companies, ignoring it can prevent everything else from working as well as it could."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Is it right for the media to make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often first appears on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images when events happen quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Even though there is official advice saying images from social media can be used without permission in special cases or if the public needs to know, people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would record or take pictures of a news event, showing that UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are properly paid for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old and comes from traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain relief. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for this purpose.

**A. What is Acupuncture?**

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is disturbed, the body can become unbalanced, leading to weakness or illness. During a session with a traditional acupuncturist, they will try to find where the Qi is imbalanced. They do this by checking your pulse, looking at your tongue, and observing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle habits. Acupuncturists use fine needles inserted into the skin and may also use heat or pressure to stimulate the flow of Qi.

**B. Over Three Hundred Points**

The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is moved. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with many more used less often.

**C. Scientific Explanations**

Even without accepting traditional Chinese medicine principles, Western doctors recognize that acupuncture can relieve pain. They have scientific explanations for how it might work. For example, stimulating certain nerves might block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some scientists think that acupuncture points release natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**

Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use of an Ancient Treatment**

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This convinced some doctors outside China that acupuncture was more than just a mental effect. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, including tonsillectomies, caesareans, and even open-heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with drugs. It is claimed that pain is mostly eliminated, but this varies from person to person. Acupuncturists say acupuncture anesthesia has no side effects like conventional anesthetics, such as nausea, and recovery is quicker.

**F. Effectiveness**

Like many complementary therapies, it is hard to run clinical trials for acupuncture. However, trials show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists report similar success rates but acknowledge it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, traditional acupuncturists say it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.

**G. A Different Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the patient holistically, not just focusing on symptoms. They spend time diagnosing, looking for weaknesses in the Qi, and considering external factors like weather conditions that might affect the pain. This approach is different from that of a typical medical doctor.

**H. Traditional or Not?**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations over traditional Chinese theory. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional methods can deep changes and long-term cures be achieved, which are hard to measure in trials. It is important to choose an acupuncturist carefully, and they should refer you to a medical doctor if further investigation is needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer known for her complex and imaginative stories. Despite her calm and authoritative appearance, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is based on how she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, needing complete privacy.

James is humble about her success, even though her 12 detective novels are loved by millions worldwide. She admires the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. Her favorite authors include women like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also enjoys male authors such as Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

James found success later in life. Now in her seventies, she published her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" at the age of 42. Born in Oxford and raised in Cambridge, she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. He returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters. Her husband's parents helped care for the children during these tough times.

While working full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office, she used her strong organizational skills. Her work included managing psychiatric clinics and dealing with juvenile crime. During her time in forensic science, she became used to seeing corpses, but it was the structure of crime novels that interested her, not death itself.

James didn't want to use her own life's difficult events in her fiction. Writing detective stories was a way to practice being a serious novelist, allowing her to explore human nature within the classic detective story format. She believes that solving a crime in a story brings order and highlights the value of life, even if the life in question is not particularly lovable. She notes that nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,"Title: Handwriting Analysis: A Growing Field

In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This sample can be as important as your resume in deciding if you are right for the job. The study of handwriting, known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Experts say it can help identify certain illnesses like heart disease and cancer, and it can also show psychological and emotional issues.

Graphology is being used more and more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of people applying for important positions. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are still skeptical about its usefulness.

Patricia Marne, who has been a professional graphologist for over 20 years, believes that handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says handwriting can reveal social class, intelligence, mental ability, and whether someone is more suited to arts or sciences. It can also show if a person is honest or manipulative.

Ms. Marne claims that graphology can help identify criminal tendencies. She says criminals often have messy handwriting and come from difficult backgrounds, which affects their emotional development. This can be seen in their handwriting, which might look childish or have repeated letters.

Graphologists can also tell if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent tendencies. Handwriting might even predict if someone is at risk of suicide. Health issues like heart and lung problems can also appear in handwriting. If a person's writing changes over time, it might indicate a serious issue.

Ms. Marne explains that handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people who write with 'thread-like' letters might be clever but devious. Writing in all capitals could mean someone is hiding their true self. Light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Unique handwriting shows confidence and creativity, while disconnected writing suggests a person is a loner.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a recognized science. She argues that it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can reveal a person's history and emotional crises without asking them questions.

Despite these claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists argue that handwriting is simply a result of education, artistic skill, and the style of writing taught, and it doesn't have any deeper meaning."
CAE_41,"Is your office working well? Fresh air and comfortable chairs are important for a happy and healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions:

Office A: Advertising Agency
- Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple, with no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and windows that open to the street. The team of seven people seems happy and adapts to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to what they might do at home. This creates a homely and happy work environment without much outside interference.
- Ergonomist: The furniture is mismatched and often leads to bad working postures. Chairs are old, not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule, which they control, reducing fatigue and boredom.
- Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They find the office the right size—small enough to know what others are doing but large enough for personal work. The office is attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
- Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and not disliked by staff. Air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
- Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal with grey, bare walls.
- Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for planners and a maternity rights poster. Staff relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by rearranging desks for better information sharing and displaying success stories.

Office C: Bank
- Building Health Consultant: The office feels like being in a glass case, but the air quality is good despite smokers and non-smokers sharing the space.
- Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements, but this is by choice. Computer setups are outdated.
- Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and have good technology. The office is busy, but the wood paneling and brown carpet make it look dull.

Office D: Newspaper
- Building Health Consultant: The building has poor air-conditioning, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered and dusty, with inadequate desk space.
- Ergonomist: The furniture is more suited to a workshop than a high-tech office. Chairs are old, not adjustable, and unsuitable for shorter people.
- Occupational Psychologist: The office is dirty and needs cleaning. Individual success should be recognized more, and air conditioning needs improvement due to many smokers. The atmosphere is stressful, and the company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"Chewing Gum Culture

Chewing gum is popular and not limited to any social class. Americans chew 12 million sticks of it every day. Let's see how this ancient habit turned into a big business.

Each stick of chewing gum has less than ten calories. It is considered a food, so it must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. Most modern gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. 

In the past, things were different. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum there.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to the growth of the chewing gum industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not worked, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances in humid conditions to collect sapodilla sap. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Using just a rope and an axe, a skilled chiclero can climb a tree quickly to collect the sap. They carry the sap to a camp, where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with a simple maize-based diet and local alcohol.

Despite these challenges, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to cut costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are also finding new ways to market their products. They claim gum helps you relax, boosts energy, and reduces tension. During both world wars, soldiers were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms and causes decay. Saliva neutralizes this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research is ongoing for new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. In the U.S., 137 square kilometers are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian cultural elements. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests. The facilities are simple, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel is on New Zealand's South Island. I discovered it by accident while climbing. After a long climb down from a glacier, I was surprised to find this hotel in such a beautiful, wild, and high location. It was amazing to arrive tired and find luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**  
Located on a peninsula in the southwest of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is in a quiet area. The road to the hotel passes by empty beaches with only fishermen. The hotel is large and offers free watersports, but you can find solitude on its nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone leaves, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia is set in a dramatic location. It is quiet and remote, standing 1,000 feet high with open rooms that look out between the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The style is colonial, with furniture made of mahogany and greenheart wood, and beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
This hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a peaceful escape from Istanbul's noise. The islands are an hour away by boat and have no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden architecture from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel is a landmark, painted white with red domes, resembling a hotel from the French Riviera. It is a bit worn but still charming.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with swans, the chateau was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one with a billiard table. There are special weekend rates that include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel in Nairobi is a comfortable place that avoids flashy luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers resting from safaris. Some guests plan to stay overnight but decide to extend their stay after seeing the gardens, rooms, and dining options. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, and is a great place to watch the sunset with a drink and a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Hotel Splendido in Portofino was first visited by the Duke of Windsor. Many famous people have stayed here, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet wealthy businesspeople. The hotel, once a monastery, is still splendid, with simple yet delicious food, fine Persian rugs, and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they meet certain standards. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. Right from the start, things were not going well for the hotel. The receptionist was busy on the phone and didn't notice Sue, which is a common mistake. Sue has seen this many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel is special because it has three red stars, meaning it's one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide Sue works for. 

When Sue arrived, she noticed problems. The entrance from the car park was through an empty door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. This was not what she expected. Things got worse when the receptionist couldn't find Sue's booking. Even though most rooms were empty, the room Sue got was not good. It was stuffy, and there was a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

Sue is known for being tough but fair. The next morning, after paying her bill, she told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she was. He was worried because there was a bad smell in the lounge due to a blocked drain. Sue suggested not taking guests to that lounge until it was fixed. Greaves agreed and took notes. He had only been at the hotel for five months and hoped Sue's feedback would help improve the hotel.

Not everything was bad. Sue praised Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a waitress, for their good work. The dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asked what they needed to do to get three rosettes. Sue said they should not serve desserts that fall apart. 

Sue's job is to give honest feedback, even if it's hard to hear. Sometimes people complain about her, but she has to tell the truth. After her visit, she writes a full report for the hotel. Hotels pay to be in the guide, so they want to know how to improve. Sue told Greaves that the Globe would keep its red stars, which was good news. However, another inspector would visit in the next two months to check if improvements were made. Greaves said he looked forward to it, but he didn't seem very happy."

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this quest later in life and describes each climb in the order he completed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
While in a snow cave near the summit, Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, experienced strange conversations due to lack of oxygen. Despite the cold affecting his feet, Doug felt confident climbing with Dougal. They reached the summit by maintaining a steady rhythm.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
Known as one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal climbed it in April 1976. They carried all their gear on their backs, a first for a new route on this mountain. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude. After a tough climb, they reached the summit.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite planned to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle but found their way thanks to marked trees. After a failed attempt on a difficult route, they chose an easier path to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, joined a group to climb Aconcagua via a less crowded route. Due to time constraints, they avoided the challenging Polish Glacier and took the standard path to the summit. Meeting other climbers inspired Doug to consider climbing all Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh weather, they reached the summit in eight hours. The experience was uplifting, even though visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they used a cableway to reach higher altitudes. They faced strong winds and icy slopes but eventually reached the summit, realizing there was more to climb than expected.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and interact with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they climbed the mountain, which is near a large gold mine. On May 12, they reached the summit, marking Doug's completion of the Seven Summits."

Besides wedding dresses, he also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a navy-blue summer suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes for most of the 20th century, but with a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

Sally Quail, who once worked for an art dealer, has no formal training in jewelry. She started designing jewelry when she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Her pieces are popular with many celebrities. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she started using diamonds. 'It reflects my age,' says 36-year-old Quail. 'I reached a point where I wanted a diamond, so I began working with them.'

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**

Lily Grimson entered the competitive fashion industry four years ago with only a basic course in art and design. Two of her handbag designs have been chosen for a major exhibition. Her bags are always noticed. All of Grimson's bags are handmade in the UK. They are not just containers; they are glamorous, made from fine calfskin or heavy silk. A mix of style and quality makes a Grimson bag special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. 'Most women want natural-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. His approach is unique - he makes sure his clients don't look like they just left a salon. However, this relaxed look is expensive - the first appointment costs £250, and there's a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain. She also provides floral ideas to top restaurants. This is impressive for someone with no formal training in floristry who left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her simple yet modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are simpler now. Keep them simple but strong, and don't use too many leaves - they are too big and architectural. For wedding bouquets, the rule is: use flowers of the same species.'"
FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to transform four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the hotel to include the latest technology for both staff and guests. 

At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name. For more detailed preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is very positive about its efficiency and features. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, which allows staff to record many preferences.

Guests often complain about room temperature in hotels. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can set each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C.

For guests, especially business travelers, the technology in their rooms is very appealing. MacCann estimates that up to 65% of the hotel's business will come from business travelers. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future upgrades. Extra cables have been installed to handle new technology. The televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be replaced with newer models anytime. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann says they have tried to make guests feel comfortable, not overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also has a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant, which already had two Michelin stars, is now part of the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He has a new, modern kitchen and better parking facilities. For the hotel, they offer a popular and successful dining option without financial risks.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially along the two long flower borders next to the path that goes from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden.' They got along well, and although Danny sometimes doubted her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan usually focuses on painting individual plants in detail rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but often she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, 'I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one, building the painting over time. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She also finds the way flowers change as they decay fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day, becoming more interesting.

Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She wasn't interested in garden flowers back then because she thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic ones in some shops. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.

Today, her garden includes plants from faraway places, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of flowers to paint, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She now has an extra gardener to help, but she believes that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area were knocked down during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change upset some of the town's more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who leads the local police, would have been upset too. However, during the storm, he was too sick to notice because he had a serious case of bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. But Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This only made him forgetful and irritable. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, he was getting his antibiotics from the pharmacy and going home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't really understand. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged, felt relieved when it wasn't, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when he started feeling better, that he noticed the walnut tree was gone and the living room looked different. The Pelhams' large house had a big garden, which made it feel private. Pelham didn't regret buying it, even though it was expensive. The walnut tree used to be part of the view from the living room. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it created nice patterns of light and shadow that hid the old furniture they brought from their previous home. Without the tree, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was now dominated by the tall house next door, which was unattractive with its purple bricks and pipes. It seemed like the many windows of the house were watching the Pelhams. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed happy. ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost,"" she said."
FCE_16,"Living in the Valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed, but the branches stayed firm. Yet, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they didn't trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that threatened us the most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high up in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we'd ever seen it so close to our home, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had often flooded the nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with just occasional overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the large clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his past ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviewing, like writing about novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything he was asked to do for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and TV. Tom hired him, but Tom wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have been more careful in choosing his team. 

At first, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn't need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose what artistic material to cover, and there would be guests to make it more social. It all felt like a dream then: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It felt just as unlikely as a millionaire wanting to help him personally and pretending to employ him. That's how little confidence he had. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with one of his reviews, he didn't know where to look.

Tom's idea for a team of arts critics never worked out. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to link a reviewer with one subject area, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have the current setup, where Mark writes a long weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him well. He wouldn't have been interested in the usual film critic's job, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That routine would make him bored quickly. He would soon be sitting in his seat on a Monday morning, sighing, ""What terrible rubbish must I watch now?"" - a type of sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide.

The space he is given allows him to expand his argument or, in a dull week, to create something out of nothing. But what is his role in the public space? He assumes people choose films based on the stars, the publicity, or the director. There is also loyalty to a 'type' of film or the opposite. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a love story fan to avoid a romantic film because of what the papers say. So if a film review isn't really a guide for consumers, what is it? He doesn't feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. Nor does he think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All he has to do is present an argument. He's not a judge, and he doesn't want to be one."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because she thinks it's fun. A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner. Ideally, this person should be female and interested in becoming an Olympic champion. They should enjoy long-distance running (regular 15 km sessions), swimming in cold rivers during winter, and cycling (loving 100 km rides is a plus). They must be able to do all three activities without resting. 

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It attracts large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes swimming 1500 meters, cycling 40 kilometers, and running 10 kilometers without stopping. It might be exciting for the audience, but why do triathletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a talented 17-year-old with good grades give up everything for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases athletes use about personal satisfaction and mental challenges. She says, ""You swim 1500 meters, then get out of the water and jump on your bike while still wet. Of course, you freeze. After cycling 40 kilometers, you have to run 10 kilometers, which feels long when you're exhausted. But it's great fun and worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It seemed so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Even though she had the second-fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried during the run."" But she didn't give up and is determined never to quit. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop to end the pain, but I'm afraid if I stop once, I'll be tempted to do it again.""

This determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard on the running machine that it threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, but while most people stop when they can't go further, she kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who are paying £1,300 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy her a £2,000 bike (it's a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about the times we're achieving.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's surprising, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about her love for collecting things and why many people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It's a world full of passion and excitement. But if you decide to collect, remember: only collect things you truly love.

People have been collecting since ancient times. Early humans collected pebbles for their beauty and wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their shapes and colors.

I've been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. My parents would take me to a local museum filled with fascinating objects collected by others.

Many people share my interest in collecting. One in three adults enjoys it. Some people collect because it gives them a sense of control in their lives. For me, it's simply something I love to do.

A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't need to be rich to collect. I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a tulip I wanted, but it was later stolen by another collector.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next day, I was sad to see the remains of my furniture and collection.

I'm fascinated by how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet becomes valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable investments, especially if you kept the original boxes. Sadly, I threw mine away."
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work: Four People Talk About Their Jobs**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions at the Science Museum. My job includes planning, designing, and promoting these exhibitions. First, I learn about the exhibition topic and talk to experts to decide on the main themes and goals. I choose which objects and pictures to display. It's important that visitors understand the exhibition, so I plan interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure everything is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to advertise it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents for students to learn the routes needed for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are learning how to plan their journeys. They find the most direct routes, using the correct one-way streets and turns. I help when there's a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. As the test approaches, I challenge them by giving a simple route and then saying it's blocked, so they must find another way. This helps them think creatively.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and mostly work from home. My job involves answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. Sometimes, I visit our main office, but I usually work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, and I run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out on boats to help them understand marine life better, which often changes their perspectives. I love my job because conservation is my passion. However, working for a charity means we always need more money, so I often look for more resources and can't always do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is quite varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and manage the stock of about 300 books we publish. We maintain high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, the four of us spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have expanded it, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it's quite a coincidence. ""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" These are the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that, while her husband handles redecoration and repairs. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and then coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then come back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, this routine had developed. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is in her second year working as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. Known as Pilch, she works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors staying in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a long-term career but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'

Sarah doesn't live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After the guests finish breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests to help themselves or cleans the rooms, which she finds the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She tries to ski as much as possible and can be on the slopes until 4:30 p.m. on a good day.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she avoids napping because it makes her too tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans up and loads the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant, but some weeks don't go quite as well.'

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps end the night at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. However, Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work starts earlier on Sunday, as breakfast for departing guests must be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet thoroughly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop and then gets a ride back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. Soon, it's time for dinner duty again, and maybe a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was about six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a bush of wiry hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour asking to see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed very serious, by giving them a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago. Marie's father had shown them how he made gloves, especially Marie's favorite spot, the laying-off table. At this table, the workers shaped and pressed each glove by carefully pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' He was pleased that she was interested in every detail. 'They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you need to visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you if you want. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. It's said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey, I think. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it was interesting once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; he's the one you should talk to. Start him on gloves, and he'll talk for two days. That's typical: glove makers love the trade and everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that filled the house when Marie came home from school, full of what she'd learned in class. How she remembered everything, neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. 'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to show you the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,"**It's a Tough Job?**

Chris Arnot talks to four people with dream jobs to see if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**

Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often has to travel suddenly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss, but she has one small issue—she hates flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,"" she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde because it felt cramped with small windows. When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. Her tasks include organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning trips, and handling paperwork. She didn't apply for the job; she met a pop group's manager by chance, which led to a job offer. She also took secretarial classes at night. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a PA.

**B. David Brown**

David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, someone who carries a golfer's bags. He preferred being a caddy because he loves golf. However, the job has downsides. Caddies earn a small fee plus a percentage of the golfer's winnings. Average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of this goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman at age 31. ""You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge of the weather, and trying to understand the course,"" he says. His accounting skills were noticed by European Tour Productions, who made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes daily play statistics from caddies' cards, which are used by TV commentators, golf magazines, and golfers.

**C. Martin Fern**

Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is trying food at top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. At the time, Martin was a creative director at an advertising agency, and the column was a good extra income. At 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a few miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**

""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. ""Before that, I loved words and wrote mostly poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about the problem of foxes killing chickens. So I wrote a story called 'The Fox Busters,' which was my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work on them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing out my morning notes on an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, which is the part of being a writer I enjoy most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust, like golden mountains, reaching down to the blue lake. One afternoon, with nothing else to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof, landing on the sawdust and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too. They looked down, nervous and pale, but one by one, they jumped and felt relieved. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Eventually, one friend said, ""Let's go back up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they climbed back up and jumped off again, determined, until only Michael was left on the roof. The others were below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the edge, licking his lips nervously, wondering why it seemed so much higher this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and taking deep breaths, but he couldn't jump. The others started laughing, tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they began to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour as the sun set, a big orange ball in the sky. His clothes were wet from sweating nervously. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, and fell heavily onto the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little gray in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled sternness, but Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, barely heard her. He kept seeing his friends' grinning faces and hearing their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy with your current job but unsure how to make a change? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change careers are turning to career advisers for guidance. The process usually involves writing a brief history of yourself and taking several tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help identify your strengths and suggest possible career paths, along with any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organization that provides career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions quickly. It was important to remember that the test wasn't about passing or failing. The psychometrics included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on this chat and the test results, the adviser created a report with observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, although I was surprised to learn I didn't do well in scientific, technical, and practical tests. It's probably a good thing I didn't become a nurse! However, it was reassuring to hear that I made the right choice in pursuing journalism.

Changing your career doesn't always mean a big shift. For example, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company after five years. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. ""Losing my job was a chance to step back and review my career,"" says Donna. Some results were unexpected. ""I didn't realize I had a talent for design, but I had to consider the cost of retraining against my financial responsibilities,"" she explains. Other options included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, Donna decided to use her existing skills and moved into a more suitable role as a Public Relations officer. She believes Career Analysts helped her understand what she truly wanted to do. She has recommended the service to several friends, who are also satisfied.

Some people feel they wouldn't have made career changes without help. Juliet Greene, 26, visited Career Counselling Services and made significant life decisions. After working at a major bank for six years, she found her job boring and wanted a new challenge. With no clear idea of what to do, she approached Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed she had an interest in sciences. After four sessions with an adviser, she decided to pursue geology and plans to start a degree course soon. Juliet feels the advice was worth the cost and is now much happier and more positive.

However, career advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, felt stuck in her career and hoped a career adviser would offer new ideas. Although she received many suggestions, she rejected them because they required a significant pay cut or extensive retraining. Amanda felt she didn't learn anything new about herself and thought a friend could have given similar advice with the same information."
FCE_22,"Title: 'A New Experience at the Dentist's'

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you'll notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch for patients. Jerome explains that half of the people only visit the dentist when they are in pain, not for regular check-ups, because they are scared. To change this, he has created a welcoming environment. He doesn't wear a white coat because it reminds people of pain. Jerome believes dental visits should be relaxing and even enjoyable.

This idea is surprising for many who think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome says that if people are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their past bad experiences. One of his new techniques is using virtual-reality headsets. His practice was the first in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Jerome examines their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth, which most patients find interesting.

The dental office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome believes that smell is important because the typical dental smell can make people anxious. The pleasant smell helps people feel calm.

Although Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but the quality of treatment is the top priority. For example, he uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It might feel strange at first, but it doesn't hurt if you're relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. He discovered that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for dentists. He believes this approach will gradually make British dentistry less formal.

As a patient arrives, Jerome offers him a cup of tea and asks what video he would like to watch. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The dental office feels more like a beauty salon than a typical dentist's office."
FCE_39,"Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a huge global business worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, which is when 8% of all chocolate is bought. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. Although chocolate began to be made in large amounts in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a spelling mistake from the 17th century. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar as we know it started in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate. At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add some French style. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, first called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular thanks to advertising that linked it to the healthy milk from the English countryside. Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week, so manufacturers are finding new ways to attract customers. One new idea is the 'extended line,' where a chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, soft drink, or dessert to appeal to those tired of regular snacks. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices from the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, perhaps think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke, at 83 years old, has become an expert in his art. He still wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the last ten years. As he shows me around his apartment, he says, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" However, Peter is not boring at all; he is enthusiastic and charming, and his creations are beautiful.

He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace and says, ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I love them. I never planned to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends visited and said, 'You should have an exhibition. People need to see these. We'll talk to a gallery owner.'"" This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened, and the pieces are quite expensive, with some costing around £2,000. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase.

Peter says he doesn't set the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else in the world makes work like his. The gallery owner told him, ""One day you'll stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more."" Peter wishes he had started this work earlier in life, as he feels he could have created even more amazing things. Although he still has ideas, he admits he is more physically limited now than when he began.

His work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which has led to intricate boxes covered in tiny shells, small pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers. Peter has developed his own techniques, using materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" but the detail, color, and symmetry in his work show careful planning.

Peter's search for beautiful, especially small, shells has taken him beyond his local Norfolk shore to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people crushing them with their feet faster than I can collect them; and the sea breaks up the rest. I would never collect shells with living creatures or dive for them, but once they are empty, why shouldn't I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty he creates from these shells."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer isn't traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, she's probably studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm sorry, Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I was trying to ignore all the negative things I'd heard about models, like being difficult, vain, and unintelligent. And now she was late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided going to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she came with her mother. Kira wasn't wearing expensive designer clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. She didn't seem selfish at all; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mom, very proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. Her older sister was the one who thought she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should try it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When she got the call saying she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she did great. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Kira now finds it challenging to balance her two lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, some unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I think too highly of myself."" This must be tough for Kira, as she's not self-important at all. But she says, ""They think that because I've become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even finish their school exams. As I finish the interview with the girl who has it all, I ask what she would like to do if she didn't have the beauty that seems sure to take her to the top of the modeling world. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat to find valuable metals. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find high levels of gold; we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

The Maddens have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing away plants and finding bits of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, but we have some people we can contact.""

As news spread about their dig, the idea of finding gold excited both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would bring more people here if they are right, but if they find gold, I hope millions won't come and damage the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she goes on deep-sea dives in a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can easily touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they can't stand or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last up to 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button, which releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested this yet, and Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first dive, where she was tested on emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. She has now completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. This area has many underwater volcanoes with chimneys that release black smoke. The Russian team was installing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers,"" another name for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a speed of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel recalls a frightening experience during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. Fortunately, nothing happened, and the relief was immense.

For Rachel, diving to the deepest parts of the ocean is an adventure. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is often the first person to see these parts of the ocean. After studying black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an incredible experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere under all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more stress. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign schedules, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere I wanted in Europe. Once you've learned to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds never feel the same. The train's rhythm rocks you into a deep sleep. Carrying everything you own in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to throwing away things like socks that are too smelly or books when you're done with them. This way of thinking fits perfectly with the spirit of Inter-Rail, where common sense and reasoning can be ignored, just like the socks and books. All you need for this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I didn't realize the possibilities of this train ticket at first. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting because there was always one more country just over the border, always a little further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We weren't completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and when planning our own schedule, we only included the most easily accessible sights. This was a chance to escape the guided tour and do something different. I was proud that, in many places, all I bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of a place that was just a name before. It's as if the city you arrive in never really existed until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and noticing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have a clear picture of the continent in your mind. Everyone knows what's there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos are so boring. While the train trip won't let you discover anything new in a global sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to realize this, though in our case, it didn't happen right away."
FCE_37,"Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out your baggage is missing is very disappointing. At best, you might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you could be in a completely different climate, far from home, with clothes that are not suitable. Airlines don't often say how many bags they lose, but frequent travelers know that losing luggage happens sometimes. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will always be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Here's how the system works: Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights, which can cause the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause problems. These issues are more common at large transfer airports, called 'hubs,' because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport managed over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports, like Miami in the United States, where luggage often goes missing when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline for the whole trip. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"Charlie James, a wildlife photographer, is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. The bird moves quickly and brightly through its environment, leaving a lasting impression despite its small size. Charlie fell in love with kingfishers when he was young, but he can't quite explain why he is so drawn to them. The kingfisher is part of legends, like the Greek myth where it is a moon goddess turned into a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. Scientifically, kingfishers have no blue pigment; their feathers reflect light in a way that makes them look blue or green depending on the light angle. This makes them fascinating to wildlife photographers. Kingfishers are shy but can be watched from a hidden spot. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he used to cover himself while waiting for a kingfisher. It took him four years to get a good picture. The European kingfisher became a big part of his life, but school got in the way, so he skipped classes and didn't do well academically. However, his passion was noticed, and at 16, he became an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant editor and then became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he dreams of making the perfect kingfisher film with just beautiful images and no words. He loves the simple approach and enjoys photographing parts of the kingfisher's wings. His photos show his deep feelings for the bird, but he knows there's more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can express."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, got her big break when she asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant and was later invited to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I've always been comfortable in front of an orchestra,"" she says. Manson, originally from the U.S., works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, supported by the British Arts Council. Since her first opportunity, she has worked with Abbado on several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is convincing people to give you the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after failing in two others. Looking back, he feels the timing was perfect: ""If it had happened earlier, I might have disappeared without a trace."" The competition opened many doors for him, including a role as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being labeled as just a ""competition winner."" ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I'll be concerned,"" he says. ""But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are inviting me back. If that doesn't happen, your career can fall apart.""

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods in opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always been taught by much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are lots of arguments, and you have to consider the singers' personalities.""

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
""Conducting came as a surprise to me, but it's very interesting,"" says Roger Vignoles, 48. It's not a completely unexpected career change, though. He started as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something new for him. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and had a clear idea of how I wanted it to sound. I tried my best to achieve that. People respect my musical ability. I'm using all my past experiences, both in music style and performance. Now, I'll do whatever people ask to find out what I enjoy.""

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor, Wayne Marshall, and mentioned him to his agent. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was challenging. He even had to deal with some musicians reading newspapers during the show. ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. Many orchestral musicians don't seem to need much guidance from a conductor. But I'm not afraid to say what I want. If people see you're worried, it gets worse. I've never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try out some of the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old had a lot of fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is also a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay longer because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings at his height! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There is something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, especially the trapeze act, which was thrilling. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is great for younger children. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at 1 p.m. and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park advertises 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very noticeable, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a few of them but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but not all were welcoming. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared to tell the kids we were leaving early."

**A. Christine Hogan**  
Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly income of over £200,000 and employs four full-time staff. She and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. Christine wanted a job she could do from home. She had experience with computers, so her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. Christine was careful with finances, always informing the bank if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, and local customers usually pick up their orders.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after marrying and moving to the countryside, she started her own business. She creates 50 different greeting cards, selling them to museums. Maggy works in a large room at home. A downside of working from home is the constant household tasks, like mowing the lawn. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. People send her work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more benefits than drawbacks in her work.

**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner runs a curtain-making business that has had ups and downs. She started eight years ago when the business was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She once managed six full-time workers but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was hard because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and hires women who work from their homes. Delia adjusts her prices when needed and looks for new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the country. Tessa enjoys flexible working hours. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to stop working. She publishes children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely because all her professional experience was in London.

**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop, earning £250,000 a year and employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, focusing on healthy fruit cakes with quality ingredients. As demand grew, she began sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, employing a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg now manages the business side and no longer bakes. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as they started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons, Paul and Huw, are talented musicians and composers, while their father, John, makes musical instruments. 

When Paul was ten years old, his parents, John and Hetty, wanted to buy him a cello because he was getting really good at playing. However, they found that cellos were very expensive. John decided to try making one himself. He found a school nearby that taught instrument making and attended evening classes for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he made his first cello for Paul. It turned out well, and he later made another one that Paul used for many years.

John eventually left his teaching job to become a full-time instrument maker. He now makes about twelve violins a year. One of his violins was even bought by the famous American violinist Jaime Laredo, which was a big achievement for him.

Both Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano and then became interested in the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin, but he preferred the cello after meeting a cellist he admired. Huw was also encouraged to play music but chose the piano and composing instead of the violin.

Paul has achieved a lot with the cello his father made. He won a major music competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. Recently, he started playing a very old and valuable cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is on loan to him. He says his father's cello is great, but the Rugeri projects sound better in large concert halls.

Paul will soon be on television playing the Rugeri cello in a famous piece, Elgar's Cello Concerto. However, he won't be able to watch it because he will be performing at a festival that night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will be performed in London for the first time. Their parents, John and Hetty, will have to work hard to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills because they work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders.

Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden job on the Lleyn Peninsula, but Gareth got it because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. He still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' issues and communicate with them effectively. His farming background also makes him fit for the physical tasks of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls.

Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes now that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault, as they were following government advice. Initially, farmers and conservationists disagreed, but now they are starting to understand each other. Gareth believes they are close to working together.

Conservation is a big part of Gareth's job, along with allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, maintaining the land, and meeting with tenant farmers. He ensures that tasks are completed efficiently and economically. Gareth enjoys seeing projects finished, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, even though he is always on duty. He enjoys talking to the public, although he finds some people's attitudes frustrating. They sometimes act as if they own the land. Despite this, Gareth believes common sense is key to the job. If you have common sense and like working outdoors, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. However, don't expect a job to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is preparing for the World Championships next month. Her days are busy: she teaches at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park. I asked her if people give her strange looks while she trains. She said, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's it.""

Kendra's life is all about being in top shape for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have support from the home crowd, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure because the home crowd has high expectations. They want us to start the tournament well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they are exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" England is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra notes that the World Championships are challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win overall, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, so you must be ready.""

In her 15 years of playing at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the final whistle, we become different people. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and must lead by example. My role is to support and encourage the team.""

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should you support a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always easy to know the best way to nurture their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. While most schools can handle children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

In Britain, there are five specialist music schools, which are relatively new. These schools create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one-third to half of their day on music activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours a day in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. However, students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school full-time, which means they spend their formative years with others who have similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally gifted children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question whether it's wise to admit children as young as seven into such a focused and disciplined setting. They emphasize that their main goal is to develop 'well-rounded and balanced individuals.'

There is a risk that separating musically gifted children from an early age can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a sense of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and offer help and advice when needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some are concerned about the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs aren't met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before considering a specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, such as a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with music training at a junior department of a music college. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with great teachers and opportunities for orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, especially along the two long flower borders next to the path that goes from east to west. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, 'It was really his garden.' They got along well, and although Danny sometimes doubted her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan likes to paint detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, 'I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one, building the painting over time. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they decay fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day, becoming more interesting.

Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and didn't like garden flowers, thinking they looked fake. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Now, her garden includes plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas, which thrive as if they were always there. Susan has a relaxed approach to gardening, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of flowers to paint, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She hired another gardener but believes that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_34,"**Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experience as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year working there, where she cooks and cleans for visitors staying in chalets, which are typical wooden houses in the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She sees being a chalet girl not as a career but as a fun way to spend a couple of years before settling down. ""It's a great way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah doesn't live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing a full breakfast for the guests, including porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys skiing as much as possible. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.""

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she avoids napping. ""It's a mistake if you do,"" she says. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., with coffee by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and loads the dishwasher. ""There's nothing worse than a messy kitchen in the morning."" Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. ""Good guests can make the week fantastic, but some weeks aren't as great.""

Sarah meets her friends at her chalet and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start at Bananas, then maybe go to G Jay's, and end at Dick's T-Bar,"" she says. However, she doesn't stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""and you don't want to be tired while cooking breakfast."" On Sundays, she starts work earlier, with breakfast ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans thoroughly, stripping beds and preparing everything for the new guests. If she hasn't shopped on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions, which she attributes to the mountain air.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment and gets a ride back to the chalet from the ski shop staff. Then it's time for dinner again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she says."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't usually stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, because of my shifts, I don't see daylight. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint, but I was fine. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it was very satisfying.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and it made me feel different—people suddenly respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don't exercise. I was surprised at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat super healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this, but it inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It offers amazing views of the sea. No matter the weather or time of year, it's always beautiful. From the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unreliable - we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train appeared, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriages - some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite train memories as children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important to me. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming took place on an old, unused part of the line, maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I returned last year, it was like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"If you want to get your story published, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some advice for you. Many readers ask us, ""I've written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" The first thing you need to do is research the market and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Selling your writing requires understanding the publishing world. No matter what you write, you need to know the market you are targeting. The best way to do this is by reading as much relevant material as you can. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what publishers are looking for at any time. Keep updating your knowledge because new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. 

If you're unsure what to write, for example, short love stories, first find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and learn what kind of stories they buy and who their readers are. Editors focus on meeting their readers' needs. Writers often ask me, ""My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I don't discourage anyone, but if your work isn't publishable, I give honest feedback with a positive outlook. Many new writers send their work too soon, often before they're ready. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. 

When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while waiting for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more. Each one will improve, and you'll start seeing yourself as a writer. Your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I also suggest not showing your work to others, especially early on. Remember, every successful writer faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible."
FCE_4,"Text: 'No Title On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station, which usually felt airy and clean, seemed crowded. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students sat on the floor with their bags. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her something. Then he came to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn't mind talking to her. The man asked, 'Are you going to Philadelphia by any chance?' 'Well, I'm going north,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and moved to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you going to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say anything, just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I stood up straight and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform as if I was focused on the train. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't. I probably seemed unreliable to him. He glanced at me quickly and then moved to the bench at the other end of the waiting area. He looked really stressed now. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She lowered her book. She was around thirty, maybe thirty-five - older than me. She looked like a schoolteacher. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favor?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my left wrist. (I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags like big pets on leashes. Then I heard the man talking. 'My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She barely said ""hello"" to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called home from the station in Philadelphia; she didn't know what to do.' The woman made a sympathetic sound. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where he was going with this. 'So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would find someone here to take her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was such an emergency? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a weak excuse, in my opinion. Also, it seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at the two of them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have made more sense, but a padded envelope the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel what was inside! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Be careful, lady, I thought to myself.'"
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. 

I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity to own a restaurant, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory and me feeling upset because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife focused on taking care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This has been very beneficial for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.

Gary was a very energetic child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into our corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had plenty of money at school. He was disciplined. He would wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very academic, but he was excellent in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He would make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he had a natural talent. So when he told me, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for my school course,' I sent him to a friend who owns a restaurant.

Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if his music career takes off. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can achieve. He understood when I told him: 'Gary, if you want to succeed in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it might be too late.' Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He had prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping other people. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one gives you anything for free. He's seen the opportunity he was given and took it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even ten percent of what you've told them, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was as difficult as finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often helped. But for Jo, who had just arrived in Dublin, there were no personal contacts to rely on. She had no one to tell her about a vacant bedsit at the end of the month. So, she stayed in a hostel and searched for a place. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going; it was just assumed by everyone at her school that she would leave. Who would want to stay in a small, remote town? That's all she had heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle. But none from Jo's year were going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed in the hostel permanently, as it was run by nuns and safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a week. But Jo didn't know they were still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who seemed to have been rejected, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" ""Oh,"" said Jo and continued climbing. ""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" ""What did she do?"" asked Jo. ""Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Jo realized Pauline was a punk, which surprised her. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one before. ""I'm Jo, I work at the post office, and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa said they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs. One had ""Nessa,"" one had ""Pauline,"" and the other had ""Other"" written on it. ""We'll put your name on it if you stay,"" Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them at seaside marinas, in movies, and on TV. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds explains how dolphin numbers are decreasing.

Dolphins are special to us because they are very intelligent, understand human emotions, and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" with its star dolphin, Darwin, have made us love them even more. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today. For example, the number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000.

You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine areas. Unfortunately, this is not true, and without plans to protect them, we might face a major wildlife disaster. There are 40 different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two usually live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups, quickly passing ships, so we know little about them. The larger bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were once found along the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the few that remain show signs of stress.

Dolphins have complex habits, making it hard to pinpoint why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which is reducing fish stocks and threatening local fishing industries, also affects dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are overfished in one area, they might not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they can't see. Modern fishing uses large nets that float or are dragged quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on beaches in France and Cornwall, with marks and cuts showing they were caught in these nets.

Pollution is another problem. Waste and chemicals in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and these poisons accumulate in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk with high levels of pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a case where a young dolphin died from its mother's poisoned milk.

Perhaps the most debated threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air, which might disturb dolphins in ways we don't yet understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but it's really beneficial for you. There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to, for most people.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It increases muscle power and helps you stand or sit with good posture. Good posture is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. Exercise also prevents muscle imbalances that can cause injuries. It quickly improves areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It also makes your heart, lungs, and blood circulation better.

You might have heard these reasons many times and feel bored by them. But here's something interesting: exercise can help reduce depression and tiredness, and it helps you sleep better. It also helps control stress and can relieve some medical conditions. These reasons should convince you that exercise is good for you. If not, just using common sense should tell you that exercise is beneficial.

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, lifting free weights, or using weight machines. Remember, training too hard or with too much weight can cause injuries, so start slowly and carefully. If you're unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is important for improving your body shape. It affects how you look and feel. A stiff or slouching body doesn't look good, lacks energy, and can have minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head up. This will help lift your chest for better breathing and make your body look slimmer. When standing with a balanced chest, you should be able to see your ankles.

Stretching your muscles improves flexibility and makes movement easier. It helps maintain good posture and prevents muscle injuries. Stretching four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit. So, stretching should be an important part of your exercise routine. Do it slowly and carefully.

The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? It's their quest for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, finding producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman can be as challenging as spotting the wildlife they film. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has faced six months of almost nonstop rain, causing unexpected problems. Newman mentioned they had to buy an expensive tool to help when their vehicles get stuck in the mud, allowing Amanda to pull him out safely.

Their teamwork has produced some of TV's best wildlife films, like their popular film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's shy leopards was airing, they were back in the wild, this time filming the equally shy jackal. This is common for TV partnerships. Traveling film-makers have been exploring the world to capture exotic wildlife since TV began.

I talked to Newman about their partnership during one of his rare visits to a safari lodge. 'We sometimes argue, but we get over it quickly,' he says about Amanda. Neither sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they view animals similarly. 'When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now, we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each day, we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask.' Their meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a bit of a worry,' says Newman.

Living in remote areas can be tough, but it allows them to get close to the animals. Newman recalls filming a lion family where a lioness would greet their car as part of her routine. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift,' and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. They now spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I have always worked well together because we share the same ideas and vision,' says Newman. 'We aim to create films rich in atmosphere that capture the true spirit of the place and animals, touching people's hearts. I believe it's better to evoke an emotional response than just appeal to people's intellect.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is preparing for the World Championships next month. Her typical day includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location and asked if people stare. She said, ""I'm too focused on my movements and feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that's it.""

Kendra's life is all about being in top shape for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they will be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure and expectations from the home crowd. People expect us to start strong.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" England is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra notes that the World Championships are challenging. ""You have to play every day without rest. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win, but in the Championships, you only have one chance.""

In her 15 years at the top level, netball has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the game, we're all friendlier."" Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. As captain, she believes in having a strong mental attitude and leading by example. Her role is to support and encourage her team.

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye, with her loyal supporters cheering her on."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers down into the ocean in a small steel vehicle to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very tight. Rachel can touch the two pilots because there is so little room. They can't stand up or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.

If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, she has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site five days west of the Canary Islands. There, they studied a large area of underwater volcanoes, where black smoke comes out of chimneys on the ocean floor. The Russian team was setting up equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When she's not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water flows at one meter per second and is 350 degrees hot.

Rachel was only scared once, during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest parts of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she sees the chimneys through the porthole, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing things no one else has seen before. After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body language, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to present yourself in the best way."" Many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't even get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before applying again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job immediately. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't turn him down. So, he offered me a lower salary than I hoped for. I'm sure I could have gotten more if I had controlled my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it can help make an interview successful. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive impression and show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I didn't plan to leave for another five or ten years, but I was suddenly made redundant. The payout wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a top local hotel. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm happy not to be in an office anymore, but surprisingly, I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. A career counsellor helped me, and I was probably the first to say, 'I don't want to go back to my old job.' Most people in their mid-forties need to work for money, but our children were independent. We moved to the north of England, leaving friends behind, but our friendships have survived, and many visit us.""

**The Hatmaker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner with even more hours, so I left. People thought I'd get bored, but I haven't. The key is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always something to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss socializing with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the product.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, making deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find it rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I've always loved sports. I tried many different ones, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are very serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you have to avoid late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it's worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice trip. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters often care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home, hang out with friends, and do normal things. You can't focus on the sport all the time; it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I've only been recognized in public a few times, which is good because I don't want to be a celebrity. I get many letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's amazing to walk on the court and feel the crowd's support. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. I still enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping, but it has downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in sports and be professional. It doesn't bother me much now. I'm focused on my game and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,"Title: Shopping with Children

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says it's very stressful because her children want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty if she buys them. But she also feels bad for saying no all the time and gets upset even before leaving the house. She tries not to take them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a shopping trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when ads make products look so appealing.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to make people want to buy products, so even if they can't directly tell children to ask their parents, the ads still have that effect.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse is a big source of stress for parents. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements, so they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says he refuses to buy sweets for his children because they're unhealthy, but he buys treats for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent because his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without their children's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to transform four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the hotel to include the latest technology for both staff and guests.

At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like guests' preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is very positive about its efficiency and features. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can record many preferences.

Guests often complain about room temperature in hotels. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

For guests, especially business travelers, the technology in their rooms is very appealing. MacCann estimates that up to 65% of the hotel's business will come from business travelers. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future updates. Extra cables have been installed to handle new technology. The televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be replaced with newer models anytime. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann says they have tried to make guests feel comfortable, not overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also has a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant, which already had two Michelin stars, is now part of the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He has a new, modern kitchen and better parking facilities. For the hotel, they offer a popular and successful dining option without financial risks.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I get energy from excitement and challenges. Learning new things gives me a lot of energy. Activities with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, are energizing for me. Dance is expressive and uplifting. I think boredom can make you feel tired and like life has no purpose. Being productive, even in small ways, gives you energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a burden. Enjoying what you do keeps you from feeling down, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep to feel great. When I only get six hours, I feel a bit sluggish. Exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to start. I do yoga once a week and try to exercise at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I get tired in the office between 3 and 5 PM, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily for energy; I think it's my natural enthusiasm and positive attitude. I dislike negativity. I believe we should enjoy life and seize the moment. Enjoyment is key. Achieving goals is important. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. Being around lively young people is energizing. I enjoy a busy life and being sociable. I like taking photos and writing imaginary song lyrics for fun. It's a good mental release when I travel.""

**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and family life, and being positive helps. I enjoy working with kids because they are resilient and give a lot. Energy is like a natural reaction from interacting with others. Smiling at people and getting a smile back is thrilling. It's better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise routine. I get active by playing with kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
""I love turning a wasteland into a garden. I once transformed a concrete area by breaking it up and adding soil. It was better than any workout. Knowing someone wants to read my writing gives me energy. I find it hard to write without an audience. I also enjoy exploring private lands like a child, even if I get caught.""

**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**  
""I believe in having interest and respect for what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you dislike drains your energy. I used to be on committees and didn't like the time they took. You have limited energy, so focus it on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. People used these bone skates until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, modern skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is important for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your body weight, leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It seems simple, right? As you practice, you can gradually make longer movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should learn. Even professional skaters fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall, which reduces the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you feel confident moving on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn the basic moves, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch good or professional skaters, you'll notice how relaxed and smooth they are. To achieve this, you should regularly practice exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises are important, especially for the legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very emotional. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15,** won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard right now. I don't have time to watch TV, hang out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to focus on each day. When I'm extremely tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

**B. Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, and it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People often say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she's met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""

**C. Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love show-jumping events; they are exciting and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined.

FCE_29,"It's true - we're all getting taller

When Chris Greener was fourteen, he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?"" because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. Every ten years, people in Europe grow about one centimeter taller on average. More and more very tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're becoming a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our ancient size, like our caveman ancestors. We're finally overcoming the effects of poor diets from the past, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We're becoming like the Cro-Magnons again, who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of history, our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. Some tribes still live this way. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming began, which changed everything. Farmers took over green areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide over half of the world's calories. This limited diet has harmed our health and growth. Over time, we've eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us undernourished. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing, was actually a health problem, according to some experts. Despite this, farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. Only recently have wealthier countries started to improve nutrition. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are becoming more like those of our ancestors. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it brings challenges. While people are getting taller, beds have stayed the same length since 1860, and legroom in planes and trains seems to be shrinking. Clothing companies also have to adjust their sizes. The question is: how tall will we get? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University suggests it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century.

However, scientists note that while individuals are getting taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly taller and rounder to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and smaller, even with good nutrition. If the planet continues to heat up, we might shrink more. So, global warming could counteract our growth."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences: What It's Like to Be Part of One**

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this experience. Studio audiences are a regular part of TV production, but they can seem mysterious to many of us. When we see them getting excited on game shows, we might wonder: who are these people?

Some people think studio audiences are not very prestigious. I've heard that even TV professionals don't always respect them, treating them poorly, like one cameraman who compared them to cattle. I used to think studio audiences were just people looking for a brief moment of fame. However, there's no single type of person in a studio audience. They come from all walks of life, with different jobs and incomes. TV shows try to attract various types of people depending on the program.

For those of us who enjoy watching TV at home, it can be hard to understand why someone would go to a studio. Why would anyone go through the trouble of getting tickets, traveling, and sitting for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch something they could see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on TV, even for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela, who said she came for the chance to appear on TV. Another reason might be curiosity about how TV shows are made. But the most common reason I heard was simply that a friend gave them a ticket.

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You imagine sitting tightly packed with strangers, following signs that tell you when to clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said they hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.

Is there a difference between watching a show in a studio and at home? For Claire, being in a studio is more exciting, and Charlotte enjoyed feeling part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. Watching him live is different from seeing him on TV at home."" Personally, I missed seeing the live actors because my view was blocked. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching them on a studio screen.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the main point. For most people in the audience, it was just a fun and free night out."

I don't like wild landscapes without any human touch. I find the human element important. When I travel, I prefer charming villages with old temples over empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham, which is in a beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape school. I loved exploring the bare hilltops, the sheltered valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt familiar but also different, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a private diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by hobbyists. I always travel first class because it doesn't cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery isn't spectacular. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there's one part of the journey I always look forward to—when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers can see people going about their day, like making tea or doing the dishes. I see myself through their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into their homes. It's the ordinary landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer to find something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and full of rocks, so there aren't many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to admire the sea's majesty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through beautiful, damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns some property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There aren't many residents or visitors. It's an unknown, empty, and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found the area by chance when I was a student, and since then, I've visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in a city environment.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted pure peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the house of my dreams. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"Title: A Day of Animal Chaos

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work, excited because she found a pine snake. She asked if we could keep it, and I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank ready for temporary animal guests, so we could admire them and learn more about them from our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting for help from their bedroom. I rushed in to find our cat, Domino, with a white mouse in his mouth. The mouse was a Mother's Day gift for me. Domino was running around the room, trying to find a place to enjoy his catch, while the kids were waving their arms to stop him. I tried to help but tripped and fell.

As I lay on the floor, I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank. It was slithering across the floor while the cat, mouse, and kids were all in a chaotic mess. The dog was barking loudly, and the pot in the kitchen was boiling over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the room. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived to old age.

Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I turned my attention to the snake. It was difficult to handle, but I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it down. Eventually, the snake relaxed, and I carefully picked it up. I took it to the end of the garden, hoping it would choose to live there. When I released its head, expecting it to attack, it instead wrapped around my shoulders like a shawl.

We stood there, my four children, the snake, and I, in the evening light. My eldest, DJ, explained that the snake liked me because I was warm, unlike the garden shed. We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it slowly climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed up our feelings: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Send me a letter! In today's fast-paced world with phones, fax machines, and computers, the traditional art of writing letters is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is a unique experience that no other form of communication can match. There's the excitement when it arrives, the joy of seeing who it's from, and finally, the pleasure of reading it. Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Sometimes my father would write, and it was always a delight to receive his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday events involving my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it's the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I often dated people who had to work or study far away, and we could only stay in touch through letters. Instead of hurting the relationships, writing letters seemed to make them better. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by speaking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! It's even more exciting when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from a holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we regularly write to each other. I can improve my French (she doesn't speak English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success happened this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a correspondence could last so long. The local newspaper even thought it was worth reporting on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

In the French Alps, at Mont Bego, there are tens of thousands of ancient rock carvings that are being slowly destroyed. These 36,000 drawings, which are about 4,000 years old, include images of cows with horns, fields, and gods and goddesses. The site was once a place for prayer and worship. However, as more tourists visit, the carvings are being damaged by graffiti and careless behavior.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, warns that if the damage continues, the drawings might not last another 50 years. He has seen tourists walking on the carvings, which wears them down, and some even take pieces home as souvenirs. When visitors can't take clear photos, they rub the drawings to make them more visible, which harms them. Some people even scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.

Experts disagree on how to protect the site. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, suggests making the mountain a 'no-go' area, allowing access only through guided tours. He believes this is necessary to prevent the site from being completely destroyed and to protect research work. However, Clottes thinks this approach is too extreme and would upset local residents. He emphasizes the importance of preserving the site, which is classified as a historic monument.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also opposes closing the site. He suggests allowing people to visit but acknowledges the challenge of preventing damage due to the site's large size. He mentions the possibility of charging an entrance fee to fund more guards, as there is no government funding available.

Annie Echassoux, a researcher, is concerned that easier access to the mountain, such as by hiring vehicles, will lead to more damage. She believes the area should be roped off and guided tours provided. She insists that financial constraints should not stop efforts to protect the site, as it is a historic area recognized by the Ministry of Culture. If no action is taken, future generations may lose these valuable drawings."
FCE_32,"Title: Shopping with Children

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says it's very hard because her children want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty if she buys them. But she also feels bad for saying no all the time and gets stressed before they even leave the house. She tries not to take them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a shopping trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when ads make products look so appealing.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often have to say no to their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to make people want to buy products, so even if they can't directly tell children to ask their parents, the ads still have that effect.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse can be very stressful for parents. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements, so they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says he refuses to buy sweets for his son because they're unhealthy, even though he buys treats for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent because his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without their children's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,"**Going up the wall**

In the past, climbers went to mountains to climb. Now, you can find challenging climbs anywhere, both indoors and outdoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, the crowd watches in awe. High above them, French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. This arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, and both events feature a key element - The Wall. This is possible because of new and fast-developing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were many good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, top climbers needed to stay fit all year. When cliffs were not usable, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.

Soon, many sports centers started building walls specifically for climbing. These walls used bricks with special edges to hold onto. Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, was one of the first to build a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He set natural rock into concrete blocks for the wall. Many similar walls were built in sports halls during the 1970s, but they had design problems. These walls were only vertical, unlike natural cliffs that have overhangs and angled rocks. Once built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the same holds.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like natural cliff features. These shapes could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere. This system allowed climbers to have endless new holds to try."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. And they are right; acting is a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, while others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But choosing to be an actor is a personal decision, and only you can be responsible for achieving your dream. There are no easy paths - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after training, you will succeed. It's about luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new faces and talent, and acting can be exciting, glamorous, and sometimes very rewarding. People often ask me to explain what talent is. I think it's a mix of natural skill and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is central to all acting and motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeeded, they might just shrug. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they don't take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Then, you get an audition, but even if you want the job, you might not get it. So, actors don't talk much about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of competing for roles and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, from the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. It's up to you because if you don't care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_5,"Title: A Childhood Game Turns Into a Business Success

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are turning a childhood game into a successful business. In their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, they play an old game called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family loved playing it on weekends and holidays. Even after moving to New Mexico, they continued to enjoy the game.

Three years ago, Dave noticed their old pichenotte board was worn out, so he made a new one. It was so well-made that family and friends wanted their own. Curious about the game's appeal, the brothers took a board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people were skeptical, but once they tried it, they couldn't stop playing.

Dave researched the game's history and found it likely originated in India as a game called 'carroms.' It evolved into 'squails' in Britain and was brought to Canada by British immigrants. The French-Canadian version is called pichenotte.

Pichenotte is a skill-based game for two to four players. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks,' which they flick across a board to score points. The goal is to flick a puck into a small hole for 20 points, with other rings worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game is fast, usually lasting just two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity, the brothers started making more boards and selling them at markets and fairs. The game became so popular that championships were organized, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. The boards sold quickly, leading the brothers to start a full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards so far. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. They sell for $595 on the brothers' website.

Although there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, the brothers are optimistic. They hope their business will grow enough to replace their garage workshop with a luxury car. Until then, they enjoy playing the game that might make them rich."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a piece of unused land, flat and covered with wild plants. For a long time, people thought it was worthless. However, one man's careful planning and hard work, with constant support from his wife, transformed this land into the beautiful place you see today. 

During the construction of the village, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. Bulldozers and digging machines helped, but a lot of hard work was also needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, carefully chosen to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting from when the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics to withstand all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself. 

You will notice that all models are made to a constant scale, with great attention to detail. This was achieved through patience and unique construction techniques. The Model Village is a popular attraction, known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been applied in other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses on modeling.

All the model buildings in the village show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition to the village.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small mistake can lead to hours of repair work. You can take photos from the paths, and dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To enhance your visit, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press them to see the models in action.

At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet the high standards of the rest of the village, as we are constantly updating and replacing them. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about us!"
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish photos that invade people's privacy and break the editors' code of practice. Sometimes pop stars pose for paparazzi, but this is not common. Usually, these photos harm public figures by showing their private moments on the front page. However, few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle such issues. These photos rarely serve the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a photo of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where privacy is expected, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It's shocking that the PCC didn't investigate on its own. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star didn't make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair attacks? 

At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and on TV and radio. The public wouldn't support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it wouldn't be profitable to wait for celebrities to take secret photos. If the PCC acted like a 'police officer', which it could, there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC realistically monitor all British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there's the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. They might have a worse story they want to keep secret, which could come out if they complain. In this way, even the PCC might seem like an enemy.

A British comedian also suffered from the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor when his family was photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the photos again with a new story about his 'anger', claiming it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It's hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Many people give advice to college graduates starting their first job. In this article, we will talk about moving to a second job. We are not talking about those looking for another temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those leaving a bad job after just a few weeks. Instead, we focus on those who are ready to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and have an idea of what you want to do. What kind of job should you look for next? It depends on your long-term goals. Ask yourself if you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to higher positions, or switch to a different field. Whatever you choose, pick your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next one. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility. If you feel like traveling, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are ready to focus on your career. 

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a great first job because they were very supportive. She learned how an office works and improved her computer skills. But there was no room for growth, so she quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Now, Juliette is a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has grown,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to help me develop. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. I went from mostly typing and answering phones to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. I also deal with various questions, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda includes me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,"Confident people: What's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were born that way, but most will tell you it's a skill they learned because they needed to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident.

A. Jenny
When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I surprised myself by doing well. Someone there suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

B. Michaela
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive and impatient. I thought that's how confident people acted, but I learned that confidence means believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lack confidence, so I talk to myself to overcome those fears.

C. Lisa
People think I'm very confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. I had to learn to look confident because it's important in TV. Interviewing people showed me that most of us get nervous in important situations, and we feel better when we talk to someone friendly. My mother once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves.' That's good advice. You gain confidence by facing things that scare you. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I would never be that scared again.

D. Barbara
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over the years. If you keep going and learn from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am liked in the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have boosted my self-esteem. They also encourage setting achievable goals. It's helpful to see you're achieving something real, rather than aiming too high and getting nothing.

E. Kim
After college, I worked as a secretary and often disagreed in meetings but was too scared to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' I also found it helpful to write down a few notes, like a comfort blanket. Everyone feels a bit nervous about public speaking. The real secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"Text: 'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his broken kite. 'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them in the shade of the whispering pine trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest and most serious kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a row of nervous competitors holding their kite lines waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites shot up into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each entered four different designs to be judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't so hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I received five such invitations that day and decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving my car inland towards Kuala Lumpur, into granite mountains covered with lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A long, narrow boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' It would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the path, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who took care of a tented kitchen and about a dozen bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. The night was completely dark, full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and thousands of living things moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was an amazing view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind, then lightning hit the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the many giant butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also worried about my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. No one stays a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were only being friendly. Kelantan might be best known for its kites, but I remember it more for its human kindness.'"
FCE_48,"**What kind of shopper are you?**

Everyone shops, whether they like it or not. But people shop in different ways. Do you know what type of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people about their shopping habits:

**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**  
I'm a shopping addict—I can't spend enough money! When I have cash, I'm out shopping, and it makes me happy. I find it hard to ignore sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple!

**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**  
I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he wants. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't often spend money on myself, so when I do, I feel guilty and don't tell my husband the real price—I always say it cost less! The real price sounds too shocking.

**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**  
I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really need to. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and would rather be doing something else.

**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**  
I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and shop quickly. I do have some mistakes hidden in my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes makes wrong choices!

**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**  
I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and disorganized, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish quickly!

**F. Lisa, 22, actress**  
I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my girlfriends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it.

**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**  
I'm a careful shopper—I like shopping, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go overboard. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much!

**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**  
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want and never buy things immediately. I check other shops to find a better deal—it takes me a long time!

**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
I'm an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city center, the shops don't interest me anymore. When I have to shop, I do it quickly and don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of effort shopping!"

**Easter Quiz for Children**  
During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about ""Surprises."" You can get the free quiz sheets at the Orange Street entrance. Children will look at 14 surprising paintings and answer questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778 because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons to paint them. Miss Violet Churchman donated it in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. You can see it in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. The exhibition also includes Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition is open until 31 May.

**Lecture News**  
There are lectures every Wednesday to go with the special exhibition. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will talk about Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will discuss Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists tell stories through their paintings.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery restaurant now has better and bigger services. With new kitchens, it offers a wide range of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Information for Visitors**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery are available every day at 11.00 am and 3.00 pm, except Sundays. These tours show some of the Gallery's greatest paintings and cover important European paintings from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."

For a group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning how to cook seriously. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to eat the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.'

Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skills to make food for themselves when they leave home.'"
PET_13,"The Outdoor Centre charges a fee for a car with four people. If there are more people, each extra person costs 50p. You need to pay the fees at the main office.

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

We are looking for people who can write great stories. The judges, including novelist Mary Littlejohn, TV reporter Michael Brown, and Keep Writing's editor Susan Hitchins, want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story. 

**Tips for Writing:**

- **Write About What You Know:** This is important advice for every writer. Last year, most writers followed this advice. Common topics were love, family, and friendship problems. However, you need to make ordinary situations interesting so people want to read them. Write about everyday things in a new and surprising way.

- **Get Your Facts Right:** If you describe a town or explain how something works, make sure you are correct. Only write about things you are sure about.

- **Hold the Reader's Attention:** Start with an interesting beginning and end with a surprise. A bad ending can ruin a story. Develop your story carefully and think of an unusual ending.

- **Think About the Characters:** Make the people in your story feel real by using the right words. 

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, and typed, double-spaced, on one side of each sheet of paper. We cannot accept stories by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. Include the application form with your story. We cannot return your story or discuss our decisions. You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, and your story must not have been published or broadcast anywhere in the world. 

The entry fee is £5, which goes to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story. The closing date is 30 July, and we will inform the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."

PET_27,"Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses, and they are found everywhere on Earth. They are the only flowering plants that can live in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way. Grass can quickly grow back after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new grass leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live in one area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh meal."

Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her creations and asked her to make clothes for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis, and they sold very well. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. Kal's parents were supportive of her career change, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award.

He got a job as a porter and also took drama classes. In 1980, film director Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. Ten years later, he became so successful that he was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, earning millions of dollars for each movie. Today, Tom still acts in films and remains very popular with his many fans worldwide."
PET_18,"Text: 'LITTLE CAT, LITTLE CAT, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? When Bo the cat decided to explore a furniture van, she had a bigger adventure than she expected. The driver found her after he had driven more than 500 kilometers. It was the end of a long day, and both the driver and the cat were hungry! He gave her some milk and started asking around. He called his last customers, but none of them had lost a cat. It was getting late, so he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital. Meanwhile, the cat's owner was also trying to find her. After looking everywhere, he remembered the furniture van that had delivered something to a neighbor. Luckily, he remembered the company's name. He called their office, and soon Bo was safely returned.'"
PET_49,"Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin in northern Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm north coast through endless desert to the cooler Southern Ocean. It's often called the 'famous Ghan', but it's mostly known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan doesn't offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally meant to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. Completing a transcontinental railway is rare, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board, everyone seemed excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners eager to get on. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip up the gorge. I left the train at Alice Springs for a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so we just walked around it and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop here. After Alice Springs, the view from the train isn't very interesting, mostly flat land with cattle. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey ended, and while the train might not have met all the promises of the advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is so far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time climbing Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is 600 meters high and is probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to get attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon got steep, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb in the future. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and all the way to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we weren't so lucky because a mist came down. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as climbing up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to slopes that are too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I only really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place because the builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. However, this new school is one of the first in our country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched the whole process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land for the school, although it meant losing some nice open space. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are huge—much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town when they need it for meetings and other events. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and large changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, one of the first things you notice is that there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from all of us inside—the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed so well that it keeps all the heat inside—and the sound too. If we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders put it there because it's a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that you can see it from far away! We took some pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added. For example, we are putting on a play for parents, but we still have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

As I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with his two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but felt happy and excited about what we had done.'"

Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized my mistake, it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old, I was far from home, and I was very worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. After I explained, he gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, and everything inside was untouched. I want to say how wonderful everyone was who helped me that day and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty. Mrs. B.

PET_60,"Text: 'Sharks Sharks are some of the most feared animals in the ocean. They are very good at hunting because they have excellent vision and can sense movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes them very dangerous to smaller sea animals, which they eat. While sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is helpful for researchers who need to study sharks, as it allows them to learn more about these interesting animals.'"

PET_53,"I'm Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov Ballet School in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around me, asking questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they started speaking English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. 

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mom stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once because I felt lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really tough, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This makes me confident that I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was so cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy.

Right now, we are preparing for a new production, and there's also a competition for young dancers that I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here."
PET_55,"The ICEHOTEL

For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. But in winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people thought the cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an art show in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, some foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the finishing date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and lots of wool socks. It's a good idea to wear shoes that are bigger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store for special deals, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). Normally, the store will be open from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for 24 hours straight on its first day. However, it had to close just 30 minutes after opening. A police officer at the scene said: 'We knew a big crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store filled up quickly, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. People outside got upset because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly. Another issue was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. Many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the store, which blocked the road completely.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got inside, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained the situation. They had no choice because it wasn't safe. I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

PET_34,"Tanya Streeter is a famous free-diver with four world records. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on just one breath. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep and returning to the surface without any help. She had gone deeper the year before but used a balloon to help her come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive at different depths to ensure her safety. 

Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of past accidents, but Tanya believes safety and training are most important. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine stays the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land at the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, choosing fast walking instead.

When Tanya practices diving, she often travels and aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, resting every other day to avoid getting tired. Outside of training, she makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental causes by doing research and making films. Growing up on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools, which she says is like living her childhood dreams. Tanya is well-known in some countries, so people listen to her about environmental issues. Now in her thirties, she plans to keep breaking her own records and doesn't intend to retire soon, as she only started free-diving at twenty-five."

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people in the cinema industry thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors came up with some original new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was a success. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again."

Caroline Benson, a new TV star, shares her experience of acting in her first TV role. She says, ""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. Before this, I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother always said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I dreamed of playing her. 

Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. 

The outdoor filming began a week after university started, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on my essays. I didn't tell my university friends about the filming, but they found out and thought it was amazing. It was a fantastic experience, and I feel very lucky. 

After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I don't come from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles but haven't received any offers yet. I don't know how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I wasn't sure what to do next.

PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than 300 types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. Honey was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who even used it as money. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that it can help prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. But honey is not just food - it can also be used for sore throats and is an ingredient in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of England's largest towns. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as weeks in the year and as many pubs as days in the year. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. The city has a growing student population and is a successful commercial center, being the largest center for insurance services outside London. Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries,' with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's modern attractions is a shopping center called 'The Castle Mall.' For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the city center as builders worked on the project. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a city center park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are successful, showing that Norwich has managed to combine the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival happened in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, there were only about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a parking lot in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at the current location outside the city.

What to See

The balloon pilots stay in contact with each other by radio and light up their balloons' burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking amazing photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am when the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to take off. The balloons come in all sizes and colors, and some are shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere and offers a great view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

The Albuquerque Box

This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

Practical Advice

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long lines at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you are not using a digital camera, you will need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the connection between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always damp because of a big waterfall. Another zone copies the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone soon."

There are enjoyable pieces by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the less well-known writers seem to focus mainly on food. For example, Jane Harris's Those Nails should not be read right after eating because it has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset your stomach! There is excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are also parts of novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a bit of non-fiction, including a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and an extraordinary piece about herself by Ursula Owen. This is an outstanding collection, and I am excited to see what next year's selection will include.'"
PET_14,"Text: ""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when children are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to start teaching children at ages three and four, but she sometimes makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, happening once every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents must also attend the classes. It is important for parents to be actively involved in the lessons. From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and their music reading skills. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists, and she often suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" follows their previous CD, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance tune, it's clear that the band is moving away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans, but they could easily become hit singles because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems, which caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets should not worry, as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create great music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the ones that make you want to dance. However, I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as good. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."
PET_36,"San Francisco

San Francisco is on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He first saw it in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was discovered from land, not from the sea. In 1849, thousands of people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The wealthiest people made their money by owning banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

Early shoes were likely made from animal skins that people wrapped around their ankles in cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on fashion trends. It was only 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be handmade, but now, although some shoemakers still use traditional skills, most shoes are made by machines in large factories.

I started a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with how some race organizers behaved. They often complain that not many women participate in the sport, but they also don't provide separate changing rooms for women. I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were of different ages and fitness levels. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did think about it, they imagined it as hard and painful training. They didn't think about running while chatting and smiling in beautiful places, like along a river. At first, they could only run for a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned from other runners about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to support women's running, and I have enjoyed watching their progress almost as much as they have.'"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built and expanded. One of these towns was Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During the summer, boats could bring essential supplies to these towns, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making travel impossible. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They delivered mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to cross Alaska. Along the way, they stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could rest and eat, and feed their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main way to travel. However, the dogs had one last important role in 1925 when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot skilled enough for the flight, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a dependable guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to move forward, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

You can even have a wedding there if you want. The bar is also made of ice, so it's not a good idea to put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are about -4°C, but guests get special sleeping bags to stay warm. If needed, the hotel can also provide suitable outdoor clothing.

""At first, no one minded that I was a girl, but then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and found her playing football outside the club. He quickly noticed she was very fast. ""He talked to me about athletics, but I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was really hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose visited her parents and convinced them that Maria could succeed in athletics and help lift them out of poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an offer to train in the United States. She had refused before because she would miss her family. Her life was very different from the girls she met in the US. She says, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

You start in Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful big cities. This city is unique because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day on the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the journey is still a great adventure.

Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with the idea of zoos. Supporters of zoos say they allow us to learn about nature and see wild animals up close, which wouldn't be possible otherwise. On the other hand, critics argue that it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also say that in poorly managed zoos, animals live in dirty conditions and eat the wrong food.'"

Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially since everyone was so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played on stage! We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half do. But anyone who is eager to play comes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. I find jazz exciting because it's both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music, but you also feel like you're part of its history, playing on stage like the great jazz performers before you. My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we wouldn't get anywhere with our music!'"

Instead, they get water from a network of underground channels, built in the 11th century, that bring water from the mountains all year. Places like this, which are usually dry but get water this way, are called oases. If you travel further south from Marrakesh, you reach Skoura.

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. Our members gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to major newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the stories accepted by these media on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three centers across the country where young people can meet and work on projects, and we plan to open more centers nationwide.

Our agency started in 1994, originally called 'Young News.' Since then, over 2,500 young people have joined. Sophie, a former member, says: ""I first learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article on young people's views on hip hop music. I was impressed by the young journalists and the opportunities they had. Age didn't matter; they were trusted to handle stories independently. I joined the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and stayed until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I imagined. With the skills I gained, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, checking articles before they go online.""

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and attend monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and over who teach new members basic journalism skills. As they gain experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are supported by older staff during these trips.

Eight-eighteen News offers training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members is in February.

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

**Flight Overview**

During the short Antarctic summer, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back in a Boeing 747. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, you can transfer your deposit if the date changes.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning. During the flight, experts who have lived in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history and answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you the view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a window seat?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will switch to the seat on your second pass. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, you can move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' so everyone can see the sights from both sides of the plane.

**What if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the satellite cloud images and chooses the route with the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica to protect the environment. To see wildlife, you would need to take a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can take photos. We also offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food.

PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly as you go over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, whenever you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow twice your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law but ended up going to art school instead. He found traditional drawing classes hard but continued to paint. In his late twenties, he received a grant from the Italian government to study art. This experience made him interested in early Italian artists, which influenced some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. To do this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, but he says he never knows exactly how the painting will turn out. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound simple, saying, 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he doesn't make drawings before starting a painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why he prefers models who don't ask to see their pictures while he's working. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he hasn't felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He says he doesn't care about following any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we didn't like the idea because of the noise. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. ""Okay,"" we said, ""but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, our house is filled with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. I must admit that, even though their music sounds a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't judge their musical skill—after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did when I was a teenager—but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people.

Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain—Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives students important life experiences outside the classroom, along with preparing them for exams. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They study in the morning and do useful activities in the afternoon, like helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is its diverse student body. Students come from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are high, at £20,000 for two years, many students receive financial help. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them can attend only because they get government support.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education with methods that truly work."

I felt stuck and unhappy in my job. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy and full of hope. I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to connect with younger classmates. They often think I'm a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am grateful for this chance to study because I know a qualification is important for getting a fulfilling job, which matters a lot to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. There are also typical student benefits like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I sometimes worry about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age has been a good decision.'"

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to warmer places. The winters in Canada are so cold that the birds would die if they stayed there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn."" Bill had a small plane, so he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he took short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather came in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to return. They didn't come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but couldn't find them. When he got back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without his help!"

KET_46,"Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler run the farm, where they keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She owns 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to prevent them from getting too hot.

Five years ago, Jenny decided to make sweaters from the wool and sell them at country markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the weather was too warm, so people weren't interested in buying sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which everyone loved because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business began.

Initially, Jenny made the socks at home, but as her customer base grew to thousands, she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, the socks are made by machines. There are six different colors, five sizes for all ages, and special socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is busiest during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In Jenny's office, there are many letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave a door or window open by mistake. He explained that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home. However, he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark, making it hard to see them. Also, many houses are empty then because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to watch each other's houses when people are not home and to call the police if they notice anything unusual. 'We can also advise you on how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This advice is free.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before farming, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, about 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started growing their own food. These were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, and their villages gradually grew larger. Some villagers could focus on other tasks, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and some people didn't have enough to eat. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes.'"

After nine months, she worked for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later joined British Airways as a flight attendant. Four years later, she became a manager. Here’s what she says about her job:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time flying. I teach flight attendants and help them with any issues. I also attend many meetings. My work hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. The first thing I do at work is check flight times on my computer, and then I talk to some of the flight attendants. Sometimes, I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are doing. That's my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring.

However, for the past few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because they have a lot of homework. They have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who had trouble with reading. Kevin learns words better by seeing pictures and hearing information than by reading. Frazer wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make a computer game, and now it's ready to use. It's a game with speaking and pictures. For example, if you see the word 'hat', there's a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their computer game, and it will soon be sold worldwide. Many schools are interested in buying it."
KET_31,"Title: How Do the Irish Pop-Group 'Boyzone' Live a Healthy Life?

Getting enough sleep is very important. When I visit my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, after a concert, it's hard for me to sleep because I keep thinking about the music. 

Exercise is also important. Before my car accident, I used to spend two and a half hours a day, five days a week, at the sports center. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups every day. I don't drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat healthy food. I also drink a lot of water because it's good for health. I aim for about eight glasses a day, but I don't always manage that.

It's important not to work all the time. I love my job, but I also enjoy other activities. In my free time, I like to listen to music or watch TV. It's healthy to relax and do nothing sometimes. I don't feel tired anymore since my doctor advised me to eat better. Now, I eat a lot of vegetables like carrots and spinach every day. But I still enjoy eating burgers occasionally!"
KET_58,"Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is more than the number of films made in the USA, making Bollywood the largest film industry in the world. Watching films is the favorite free-time activity for most Indians, with ten million people going to the cinema daily. Bollywood films usually tell romantic love stories and always include singing and dancing. These films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make, while a Hollywood film usually costs at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is different; he is considered one of India's greatest actors and has starred in more than 140 films over nearly 40 years."

I like Britain and want to go back, but my daughter, Felicity, is about to start college here, so we will stay for another four years. I recently spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to discuss the book I just wrote. Most writers don't enjoy traveling around to promote their books, but I don't mind it. I like visiting new places and meeting many people. It's very different from my life in the U.S. when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars, and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was nice because I didn't have to pay any bills.

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes came to England over 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer arrived more recently. The name ""Giant"" fits well because these dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs to be cut often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use them to help with sheep. They are also used by the police because Schnauzers are very intelligent. A Schnauzer is a good family dog. It is friendly and great with young children."

KET_1,"New Books This Month

The Long Night  
This is the first book by David Reilly. David started writing after teaching English for several years. The story is about Maha, a nurse in northern Australia. She works in a small hospital. One day, a baby is very sick, and Maha has to drive all night to take the baby to the nearest big city. They face many challenges on their journey.

Hard Work  
This exciting story is the twentieth book by Joanna Jones. It is about Sombat, who works with his father, a carpenter, in Thailand. They work long and hard making tables and chairs, but they do not have much money. Then one day, a man dressed in all black buys the most beautiful table in their shop.

Hospital or Cinema?  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. The story is about Tina, a young Brazilian woman who dreams of becoming a doctor. She goes to London to study English and medicine. But one day, she meets a man who asks her to go to the USA with him to become a film star. What will Tina choose to do?"
KET_53,"Horse racing has been an important sport throughout history. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses. However, in the early 18th century, races became shorter and included several horses competing at once. Today, horse racing is very popular in the USA, second only to baseball, and is also enjoyed in many other countries."

KET_50,"Parrots

You might have seen these beautiful birds with their bright colors and long tails in the forest or at the zoo. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They usually live in large groups. Because they like to eat fruit, they can sometimes cause problems for farmers. There are many types of parrots, but all of them have strong beaks and feet. They use these for climbing and holding food. The largest parrots can live up to 80 years. They are very noisy, but they are smart birds and can be taught to talk easily. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."

A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago.

This is because he has written for French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend money on lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy?

A few months ago, he went to Japan to sing in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on the radio. Many young people called the radio station to request his songs again. In Japan, John uses the stage name Jon Otis, but he plans to continue working in the park in England. He is not sure how much money he will make from his music yet. ""I need to keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have bills to pay!""

In Britain, many people have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. You can find clubs and classes for this activity in almost every town. According to Fiona Lever, a line dancing teacher, ""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" You don't need a partner because you dance in groups, which makes it a great way to meet new friends. In Fiona's classes, both young and old people participate. Boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing.

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."

KET_4,"The History of the London Police

Today, you can see policemen everywhere, but in 1700, London didn't have any policemen. A few old men used to watch over the city streets at night, but they didn't earn much money. About 300 years ago, London started to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people preferred to stay at home.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began paying a group of people to catch thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown a lot and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was created with 3000 officers. Most of them worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are paid quite well, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others."

For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are lively with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even watch artists painting on the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues like halls and cafes. Many tourists come to see new films and plays and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it's often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be hard to find a room, so consider booking your hotel now!"
KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and thousands of Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they fish for the fish swimming under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,"" he says. ""First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then, you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five!

A very popular tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. At this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures of people and started a museum for them in Paris. Marie helped her uncle with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was put in prison. While there, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her wax figures are still on display today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were costly, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have now. Later, as bicycles became less expensive, many people started buying them. People began using bicycles to go to work and for leisure activities. Today, cars are used more than bicycles because they are much faster and you stay dry when it rains. However, some people still prefer cycling to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers and it's hard to find parking spaces."

Three elephants came in with their trainers and stood in front of big white cards. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started painting on its card. The trainers helped by giving them new brushes with paint and taking the old ones away. Slowly, the elephants followed their trainers' instructions and drew pictures. I was amazed! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the trainers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest ones live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Big Cats

There are many types of cats, and they are different in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats. They can be up to 3.7 meters long from head to tail. Unlike most cats, tigers enjoy water and often lie in it to cool down when it's hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. Several lions work together to hunt for food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and easily track other animals. All cats need good eyesight because they hunt smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong."

Thank you for your assistance.

Yours faithfully,

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is considered the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro make it to the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it might be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can move through the water at speeds of over 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very polluted, which caused many fish and insects to die, leaving otters with nothing to eat. However, today there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again.'"

I'm happy to have you as my new penfriend. My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. I was born in Canada, but now I live in England. Please write to me and tell me about your life in India. I would love to visit there someday. Do you live in a small village or a big town? What is your school like? Do you have any pictures of your school that you could send me? I'm sending you a few photos of my family, and I'll send more next time I write. I hope to hear from you soon.

Can you help us? Carlos Dear Carlos, Hotels in the center are expensive, but I have good news. I talked to my aunt Gloria about you, and she says you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house! Is that okay with you? David'"
KET_59,"Text: 'Buildings People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to store beautiful things. Many people work together to create a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures to show their ideas. Engineers ensure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully construct it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof. But the building is attractive from every angle, not just from above. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a famous roof. This interesting building looks like a tent made of glass.'"

The problem is I don't have anything to wear. I've grown a lot, and now all my trousers are too short! I want to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots. I don't have much money to spend, but I think it will be enough. Would you like to meet me in the morning or the afternoon? Let me know. Sarika'"
KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large drawing of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. No one really knows when the Cerne Giant was created, but it is believed to be very old. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill.'"
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the top runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she aims to compete in the 10,000 meters and possibly the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always stayed cheerful, and people in her hometown admire her for that. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She won with an excellent time, the fastest of the year for any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop competing after injuring his right leg. He can still run a bit and sometimes trains with Gail. However, it's not enjoyable for Mike when Gail overtakes him, and he can't keep up. Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. But she always takes a break from running on Sundays. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. His mother started teaching him piano when he was six. By ten, he wanted to write music and soon began his first song.

Oleg Gagarin was the youngest of five children. At four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him traditional Russian music. When he was six, he started piano lessons with a teacher in his city. Oleg quickly began winning prizes for his piano skills. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years, then returned to Russia.

Josef Heptmann's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he started playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England. Josef always loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now but hopes to write his own music someday."
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he started writing children's books at 60. Now, 13 years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he writes in his office and in the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me if she doesn't like something,"" Bill says. His ten grandchildren, who don't live nearby, also read his stories and give their opinions. This feedback helps Bill understand what young children enjoy reading. 

Bill writes about life in his village and nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, ""The Sheepdog,"" which is about a farmer and his helpful dog. ""I have always liked animals,"" Bill says, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" Last year, ""The Sheepdog"" was turned into a film using real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film,"" he says."
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the 19th century. It showed a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards started to have pictures of news events from that week, like an accident or a visit from an important person. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures at that time.'"
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur because they died out about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. We don't know exactly why they became extinct. Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs came in many different shapes and sizes. There were over 5000 types. Some were very small, while others were huge. The biggest dinosaurs were larger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex wasn't as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because of its long back legs.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can kill a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well and, like most animals, they use their noses to find food. There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in Southeast Asia. But not all black bears are actually black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which is from China. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard for them to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm areas of the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat anything they can catch, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat large animals or people. There are more than ten different types of crocodiles. All of them have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much bigger. Crocodiles can live for a long time. The oldest one in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the air. Then, 120 years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers in the United States built the first airplane with an engine and flew it. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes changed a lot. In the 1950s, they became much faster because of jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world, flying at 2500 kilometers per hour, so a trip from London to New York takes only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen loved going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. The visitors ate, talked to their friends, walked around during the show, and some people even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"
KET_48,"Dear Jeff,

I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water there is very warm, and I love swimming. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home!

See you at the end of September.

Sue"
