CPE_15,"Title: Charging for Rubbish: A Complex Issue

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. However, it might not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. People put their rubbish out, and it gets collected by a truck and taken to a landfill. Although households pay for this service through local taxes, the cost is the same whether a family produces a lot of rubbish or just a little. This is strange to economists because the more rubbish there is, the more it costs to collect and dispose of it.

The simple economic solution is to charge people for the amount of rubbish they throw away. This would encourage them to produce less waste and recycle more. However, American economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this approach can have unexpected and sometimes disappointing results.

They studied several American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags for rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags would be collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, residents were charged 80 cents per tagged bag. While this seemed like a good use of market forces, the costs of running the scheme were high. The number of rubbish bags decreased by 37%, but this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a practice known as the 'Seattle stomp'. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfill sites. The actual weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%.

In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, rubbish weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying, which might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be due to the fee, as many people were already recycling voluntarily.

In a broader study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that while pricing does reduce rubbish weight, the effect is small. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is because to significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything, and a small fee is unlikely to change that.

Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important as price. In wealthier towns, people produce more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand these effects, and sometimes the results are not as pleasant as expected."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work lives might change. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Just having a successful career isn't enough anymore. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your work used to be enough to make you special, but now you need to consider how your job affects you personally—your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just shaping us to fit industrial needs. Work should be more than just creating wealth; it should be a fulfilling lifestyle, helping us discover hidden talents and meet diverse people. However, this doesn't mean simply eliminating unemployment. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs aren't as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely get to be creative, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are downsizing. Efforts like decentralizing decisions, improving skills, and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organization's.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or sometimes harm people. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and how courage can be developed. I've looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts work on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, theoretically free to leave but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel isn't just a place for travelers to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations. People from all over the world meet in hotels but usually don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the skills of the students they employ instead of giving them only basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit them, saying companies should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is about relationships. Now that many people want more than just obedience and see work as a way to express independence, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with people who might seem very different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This new conversation is more intimate, creating respect and understanding, and can change you. It's more than just relaxing; it's a powerful way to create equality. Every time you have a conversation like this, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,"Broadcasting originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand, symbolizing growth and abundance. This metaphor was applied to the new technology of broadcasting, which involved transmitting words and pictures electronically. Despite its potential for two-way communication, like the telephone, television was quickly developed as a centralized mass medium. This approach matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies, where information was sent from a central source to private homes.

There were some early experiments with alternative forms of television, such as two-way communication, but these did not last. In Britain, radio amateurs in the 1930s tried to create a more grassroots, egalitarian form of television. However, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these amateurs out, favoring a more centralized approach.

In the early 1930s, television was often viewed in public places, similar to how films were shown, and this was common in countries like the USA, Britain, and Germany. Although public viewing posed a potential challenge to the idea of television as a home-based medium, it did not prevail. As technology advanced and prices dropped, manufacturers saw the opportunity for mass sales of home television sets.

The rise of broadcasting was closely linked to social and economic changes. As people moved into cities and became more isolated from traditional communities, centralized broadcasting helped governments efficiently communicate with citizens and foster a sense of national unity. Broadcasting also played a role in promoting democracy by providing equal access to information necessary for informed participation in society.

Today, broadcasting is evolving, and the term itself may become outdated. The metaphor of broadcasting might eventually only describe a specific phase in the history of audio-visual technology during a time of centralized social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe or satisfied. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things can become too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. It often suggests that if you don't own certain things, you're not as good as others. To see how much ads affect you, try not to read any billboards next time you're out. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us even noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, and the internet—all telling us to keep buying more.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on how they form, their water systems, and the life inside them. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature that spark our curiosity and drive for knowledge. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves have impacted human life, studies have been even more intense. However, exploring caves often requires physical skill, so cave research is not just for academics. There is a unique overlap between professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who explore caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools provide us with constant weather updates quickly, and computers solve complex calculations faster than humans can. Meteorological theory is full of long, technical words that can be confusing to non-experts. However, simple weather wisdom is still important. Human experience is crucial in turning computer data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I see that music is the most important part of opera, with theatre coming second. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are central. In theatre, once the performance starts, there's no one directing the action, and the audience usually understands the language spoken on stage.

In music performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, don't have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-level music is like watching a sports event; we see athletes doing something similar to running for a bus, but much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems like what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, though they often ask, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play is.

Should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think so. I've seen how a different approach can change the concert experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it can go wrong, engaging the audience's imagination as a group. However, music presentations often feel hierarchical, with strict dress codes and too much respect for conductors and soloists. On the other hand, modern audiences sometimes interrupt performances by clapping at the wrong times, which can disrupt the flow of the music.

Can anything be done? Yes, a lot is being done. There are efforts to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from place to place in a cathedral and then into the town. It was a top-quality musical experience, and it changed the lives of many in the audience, who were not just watching but also participating.

I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can have. Sometimes this comes from using unusual locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous in such spaces. I know most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe music conventions can and should change. I speak as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend a lot of time and money on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
While I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly an annoying obstacle between a car park by the sea and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you like plaster and is hard to remove, even with a strong water spray. But strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you keep finding sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more comes off when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, I don't like sand at all.

**Lock and Key**  
The need for a safe home, privacy, and security has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden bar behind the door has been replaced by electronic locks that use a plastic card with countless combinations, but the desire to keep out intruders remains. The attraction of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't like them much. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a real key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the design.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to analyze it like a school essay. The idea is to let art speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed were the labels, real labels that explained the context of a piece and what it was trying to say. Instead of just staring at the pictures without understanding, these bits of information helped me get it."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When adapting novels into films, the process often involves cutting down, condensing, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and narrative in a novel scene could be left out, yet the main point would still be clear. This doesn't mean the original dialogue and description were unnecessary. It's about the different ways stories are told in books and films, and how each uses repetition. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking, even if it's not strictly necessary. In stage plays, which are mostly dialogue, real speech is imitated with some style. Some modern plays use so much redundant language that it becomes hard to understand what is being communicated.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can be an immersive experience, making you feel part of the film's world. For the duration of the movie, you escape from reality. However, once the film ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. This temporary escape makes it hard to take movies seriously as an art form. In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, saw movies as mere entertainment, not art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but many small, similar rooms were used for meetings. These rooms were hard to tell apart, and finding your way around was difficult. The studio had no clear main entrance, which added to the confusion. However, strangers were rare because the studio didn't encourage visitors. Employees knew their way around, and together they created films that offered audiences a temporary escape from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookshops are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and launched his career. Rodriguez's success story is a dream come true. He recalls his 23rd birthday, thinking he had only a few years to make his breakthrough film, comparing himself to Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg. In the past, filmmakers took time to mature, working behind the scenes before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without studio support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of cramped, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, would fill the air with a strong sulfur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. 

Most of my early life is a blur, but I do remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, I have vague memories of faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of a mansion at Earlham. 

My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as she would be on a deserted moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety, which was rare on the West Earlham estate. This sometimes led to intense cleaning sessions or instructions to 'behave properly.' As a child, I didn't understand this moral code, and even now, I'm not sure I do. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly for long periods in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and following many other rules and restrictions.

Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier but not entirely approved of by the others. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was. They formed a sad group, talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy burden of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' weighed on me, and I felt I had to grow up quickly to escape it. 

Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. After your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. Some lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats, but I think my mother let other children in the street take me to school. 

If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays. Those were the days when you got glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and once, there was a charity fete at a house far away on Christchurch Road. A kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a junior charity, I think. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were 'only after your money.' My mother often talked about people having selfish motives, and she had a deep distrust of politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she probably imagined it as a place where rich people took money from the public. 

I might be exaggerating, and I might be ignoring her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. But my mother didn't have much kindness; it seemed to have been drained from her. To be fair, she did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes,' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't completely against this activity and even started to have opinions about the art. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and joking, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well since childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was as familiar to me as the small grooves in the sidewalk that guided rainwater from the roofs to the street. These grooves marked my path when I skated or rode my scooter. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to reflect a slight drop in social status: the porches were closer to the ground, and the front yards were smaller. Over time, changes occurred: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had turned back into homes. I wondered how the residents adapted to living in spaces that once held merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were once used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space, both for practical and aesthetic reasons. In his previous home, his living and working areas were combined, making it hard to separate work from relaxation. So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. Gilbert wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could either cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental and homely furniture from his parents or bought at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was full of secrets and mysteries, making his nomadic lifestyle a topic of literary debate. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed the way travel writing was done, with the excitement of a thriller and the charm of romantic fiction. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction, changing details to make stories more interesting or to highlight the book's theme: that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain in 1996, I hurried across my lawn and took refuge in the pool. As I swam, I watched raindrops create small fountains that turned into bubbles and burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was then that I thought of a long swim across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain's path to the sea, breaking free from the monotony of swimming laps. In our world, many places and things are marked and explained, turning reality into something visual. Walking, cycling, and swimming allow us to reconnect with the wild and mysterious parts of the world by stepping off the beaten path. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of our world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin believed that crying had no clear purpose in evolution. He was likely wrong. More recent studies suggest crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby noted that crying helps build the bond between a mother and her child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying becomes less important than the visual message it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing great injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, which can be embarrassing, like when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We've all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people know something about global warming, but no one is sure about its exact consequences. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, changes in climate will significantly affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have used these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support six billion people. Any changes to these resources are serious. The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes.

Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes the current and future situations uncertain. We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These programs run on powerful computers and use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future. However, these models are simplifications of the real world and have many limitations. Their results are only approximate, and they are slow and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not fully understand all the processes of the climate system, although we know it is complex.

Despite these research challenges, most people agree on one important aspect of climate change: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs are used to understand the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature will increase by 1°C to 3.5°C by 2100; the average sea level will rise by 15-95 cm; and there will be changes in rainfall patterns. Scientists also expect extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas.

These forecasts show the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Climate changes can affect where ecological systems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the species they contain, and their ability to provide benefits that societies depend on. The resources we rely on, such as food production, water, and human settlements, are sensitive to climate changes. The effects, some of which may be irreversible, are likely to be negative in many areas. However, not all impacts will be bad. Some climate change effects might be beneficial. For example, in Australia, research shows that the average wheat yield has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, causing less damage to crops.

However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, either by long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to arise first in dry regions and areas where demand or pollution has already caused shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where decreasing rainfall trends have been identified in some parts, along with changes in seasonality. In southern Portugal's Alentejo region, more rain is falling in autumn and winter, reducing spring totals.

Another negative effect is likely to be changes to glacial processes, impacting glacier ice, ground ice, and sea ice, which will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that the Arctic's ice cover will melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.

The most dramatic effect of global warming in the 21st century will likely be rising sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean—warmer water takes up more space than cold water—and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results, with cities like London, New York, and Tokyo facing significant disruption. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, creating millions of environmental refugees. The most severe consequences could be for small, low-lying island states, which might disappear if worst-case scenarios happen. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands and for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This is the type of person needed for the first mission to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plan to launch a spacecraft on 5 January 2018 succeeds. The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next chance to launch, when Mars and Earth are in the right positions, won't be until 2031. It's a big challenge, and the race is on to create systems with completely new technologies. If these can be developed quickly, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it doesn't launch, the work done to reach these goals will still be valuable for future space missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Ironically, the very existence of art, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can sometimes hinder our understanding of it. This is because art is often seen as physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can block our understanding of art.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that prevent new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on people's lives. When art is separated from its origins and its impact on experience, it becomes difficult to understand its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountain peaks are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how mountains are connected to the earth. Similarly, those who study art should show how it connects to human life.

To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the everyday experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We need to take a detour to understand art. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing about botany, understanding flowers requires knowledge of soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art in its highest forms, we must start with the raw experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.

Many people might be surprised to learn that they enjoy everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. The arts that resonate most with people today are often not seen as art, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When traditional art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often share the misconception that art is separate from ordinary life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team: in the evening light, a group of silent cats jumps from the shadows like skilled hunters and surrounds their prey. Lions seem to be the perfect social animals, putting aside disagreements to work together for a common goal, like catching their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, others might benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. If there were a list of inactive elements like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions to it. Therefore, it has taken many research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to get answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a big moment for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious, plain styles and loud guitars of the past; in came a lighter mix of melodic local styles. The album combined social commentary and strong emotions with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, sad songs like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" those wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the last three for the full 300 gold pieces. Even then, I understood there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I've never forgotten. When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I was interested in, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. In the end, I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" The person sorting it is usually a junior editor or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much influence, but they want to find something original - the junior to make a name for themselves and find an author, the freelancer to keep their job. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a more senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at a meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales. They will also consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect, which you will have assured them of in your letter. Another important factor is how promotable you are, as a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency during the early 1990s, you probably faced one of the hardest times in your career. The economic recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 was particularly tough: the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, consumer spending dropped, over half a million people lost their jobs, and about 75,000 homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with some industries like vehicle and construction seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies across different countries suffered.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to help boost company profits and were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also had to work with smaller budgets, being told to achieve more with less. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies started focusing more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was convenient to produce. This shift meant that marketing activities finally received the attention they deserved, raising the status of marketing professionals but also increasing their responsibilities.

Marketing was increasingly seen as a solution to all problems, even though it wasn't. With about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the pressure was on advertising professionals to deliver results. The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the industry's worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economic climate, but also because clients began questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money and what return they were seeing on their investment. Advertising was under scrutiny like never before.

Clients demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant that advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession made it difficult to produce effective advertising, with controversies over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising.

Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions on advertising, and the challenge of advertising abroad. These factors forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to make advertising more effective was greater than ever.

Unfortunately, help for those wanting to improve their advertising was not readily available. Companies and agencies were too busy dealing with the situation to share their insights, and those who succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which didn't help those responsible for making it successful."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't considered a desirable job. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs are known for having tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed-off and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the intellectual and social pretensions of college life. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing. However, my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal for me. I first experienced this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still remember the starter I had. After that meal, I felt like bowing down in admiration to the chef who made it. I felt uplifted for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt like a distraction from my true passion. I educated myself by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and cooking elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he criticized me: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt as if I were in a silent bubble. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I collapsed awkwardly, and my legs went everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he couldn't dampen my excitement. ""That's what they mean by 'free as a bird',"" I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of being a traveler is both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing steep, icy mountains prone to avalanches; who sail alone in fragile boats through towering waves; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available, and who can live for months in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It's easy to dismiss such people as oddities, which they are, and to categorize them with the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or even writers. Their existence is undeniable, but the strange, uncomfortable world they inhabit is far removed from our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, grateful that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like dashing across a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a top sailor, though he is clearly competent. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that gives sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a ""fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea."" Raban argues that since the compass came into use about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, meaning they no longer need to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space to cross. Since the helmsman's job is just to keep a steady course, he can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two of life's great pleasures: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people themselves. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity and accuracy that we can't. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open when we first arrive in a new place, or when we read a great book that shows us things we hadn't noticed before. Our mind becomes alert to new ideas and feelings. We notice the colors of the sky, the changes in a person's face, a friend's insincerity, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I've restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but added little else. I've corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. Looking back, I could have made more improvements, but that process would never end. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would seem like I knew the future, which I didn't. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already happened. This is the real story of mass travel: the world opening up to people who only need a ticket to explore it. But I believe my fellow travelers weren't completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been overused, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, as people became more aware of the environment and tour operators realized travelers wanted to avoid harming the places they visited. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or mild adventure might be called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, many travelers are confused about what ecotourism really means.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost the notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't as helpful as it could have been. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one welcoming house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped traveling, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes only made brief notes instead of detailed stories. Worried that I might have mixed up details when writing this book, I added some warnings and uncertainties. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story unfold naturally without too many explanations."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the growth of capitalism in the 1800s and 1900s. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 1500s and 1600s. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new ways to make different types of clothing and accessories have been invented, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the people involved.

**Writer**

Stories about publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false impression of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't sell well or become a movie. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the generosity of people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were playing at across the country started selling out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future Challenges**

Technology keeps changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It's clear that more people will have access to music because it meets many human needs. Music is part of every major national event and offers many activities for individuals. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these findings need more support, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children, including those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas, like good study habits and organization.

In the short term, there will still be a demand for music lessons. But what about the long term? Will there be changes, and what might they be? I think two things are likely. First, people will listen to a wider variety of music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to create music without needing as much technical skill. This might reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on performing live. At the same time, more people of all ages will want to make music, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching should adapt to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring them to stay relevant for a wider audience. They will need to include a broader range of musical skills. Musicians will need training to inspire and teach people of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. Positively, this is a chance for music educators to show the quality of music teaching available.

Finally, we need to raise the importance of music. Music is vital in our lives, but it's often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and mockery. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, as required by their film or theatre companies. Instead of using simple, meaningful responses like dancer Pavlova's famous reply, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" actors often fall into using clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield, a respected actor, once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when performed. Discussing it makes it seem theoretical and empty. Acting has no strict rules, except perhaps being audible. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. Once a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a delicate balance between youth and adulthood. His performance is simple yet confident, showing great skill and control. Lester's interpretation of Hamlet is of a tense, edgy young man, full of controlled anger, wit, and humor, making him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtle but clearly skilled. Notice how his body language, like his stiff arms, suggests a character ready to come to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives the impression of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a creation of real behavior? What drives these characters, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" actors breathe, let the thought settle, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from external or internal sources. Actors should look into the eyes of their scene partner and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach this with an open mind, without pre-planning or judgment, trusting that something will naturally happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's disheartening if the staff treats it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No audience member should feel they have a poor view of the actor. It's important that they are close enough to see, hear, and feel connected to the performance. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If the space overwhelms the actors, it fails to honor the human form central to drama. Many theatres from the late 19th century got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. Theatres with a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, convey layers of human presence. Regarding plays, you can't cater to everyone. Audiences don't always know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real significance was how it affected the middle class and older generations. It also set the stage for future rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing it would be a big part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this exciting new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many future rock stars. Like young John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg to hear rock and roll, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow beneath me collapsed. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between two rocks, which melted and left a fragile crust that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess my situation. In an hour, I had only covered about half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While a lot is written about collecting data, these books often don't explain how to analyze it. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers analyze their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about their methods. The goal was to share insights into the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook. This involves making hidden methods more clear. Although this seems simple, it is quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in various styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce, saying, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show he had watched. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't recall much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but his son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. While new technology can be useful for teaching, formal education still plays a crucial role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people in Los Angeles didn't like this change, seeing it as a negative influence. However, they eventually accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by how much money a film makes. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that might make someone a star but will definitely make money. In less than a century, Hollywood transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it remains like a village, with a narrow focus on films. People there talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Successful people often try to leave, working there but living elsewhere. Still, Hollywood is the place where almost everyone in show business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new form of art. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it in photography. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and chemically treated surfaces produced images that were more lasting and detailed than what painters could create in weeks or months. This caused concern among other artists, and art critics argued that photography wasn't true art because it relied too much on mechanical processes. Despite this criticism, photographers believed they had discovered a new art form. They used photography to interpret the world and present their vision of nature and people, just as other artists used brushes and pencils.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations, even novels for older readers. However, as time went on, fewer books were illustrated because print runs became shorter. Children's publishing was still active, but it was often done on a low budget, leading to a lot of routine and average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The collection of black-and-white illustrations from this time is a mix of ordinary and exceptional work, a great resource for research or browsing. The best works are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reissues of books or exhibitions of original illustrations. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers might see the potential for reprinting classic children's book illustrations or creating new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

A while back, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This highlighted the potential problems of sharing too much online. The internet offers amazing chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. 

Feeling down? Maybe, but don't lose hope. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame—long before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was called then. The web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teens like him. It was created at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He built a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was certainly the work of someone who liked attention, there was also a discipline and beauty to it that could be considered art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He chose to stop blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you think it will make people like you, you'll be let down.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to all the vice presidents at her company, including those she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are having trouble sleeping and feeling anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have long-term sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books have characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, why we need it, and what happens when we can't sleep. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A top sleep researcher says, 'People sleep less when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' A sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight hours of sleep. This shows they were catching up on lost sleep. In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers, pay them, and ask them to change their sleep habits. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures people who worry about the electrodes on their heads. The lab is more interested in physical effects. They have a driving simulator in a dark room. Volunteers come at 2pm, when people naturally feel sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road on the screen seems endless, the sun is bright, and the room is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has videos showing they do. At first, they sit upright, eyes open. Then they blink more and nod off. Each time, they wake up suddenly, but the car has already veered off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests alertness products like tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers. What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, we go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, we have theories. Sleep might repair the body, restore muscles, or rest the brain's creative part. But these might also happen when we're awake but relaxed, so it's unclear. Scientists are sure women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why. When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, 'Sleep helps us pass time safely.' Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This break was a time for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which was more efficient. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns. Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up. A full night's sleep is not common. In some tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for danger make continuous sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"Title: A Former Racing Driver's Reflection

I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing $800, while standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I knew I wasn't a real cowboy. As I looked at the Arizona mountains, I realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, feeling like I might look like a cowboy from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and carried a dirty bag. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word.

I wished there was an outfit I could wear that would make me feel like I belonged, no matter where I was. I loved being a racing driver, but I don't race anymore. I can't even if I wanted to. So, what do I do now? I thought I had other options, but they vanished when I needed them. I considered becoming a commentator for racing events, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also tried starting a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work out because nobody was buying.

Being an ""ex"" anything is tough. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a World Champion. Even if I had won, people would only listen for a short time. Last year's champion is old news. I don't want sympathy, and I don't get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of racing, the fast cars, and the excitement. I miss the attention from fans and reporters. Being famous, even a little, was nice. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me, and kids wanted my autograph.

Now that I don't race, my phone rarely rings. I have a lot of free time. I looked at the blue sky and noticed some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I realized I had a lot to learn, just like a fake cowboy in fancy boots."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past decade, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, locals enjoy walking through the city, and if you join them, you'll likely hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and work. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that newcomers and the growing tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. While this name is used less now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever before.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like myself, often aren't great at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think we're that focused on money. It's more likely because, in our work, we aim to create a strong impact, which makes it hard to write spontaneous letters. True creative artists, who don't consciously focus on the impact (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I believe that understanding the effect of one's words is the true test of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, yet it showed his greatness as a writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal would often be invited to cut the ribbon. Nowadays, new supermarkets open so frequently that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, elderly shoppers didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer, who knew an employee, said the first five men would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and those who arrived later feel envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the film. Despite receiving mostly excellent reviews, the film was not a commercial hit at first. It was television that later made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many people to become filmmakers. This is especially impressive because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a remarkable team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to chat with someone, and it was the best place for it. Carmel nodded in agreement but seemed distracted, as if she didn't really hear or understand him. ""Will you be okay? What are you planning to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might stroll downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost sinful to just idle away the day."" Dermot smiled back, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it surpasses even our basic greed, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as inferior. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are often just fancy terms."
CPE_55,"I was in Vienna to take photographs. At that time, taking photos was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change the look of things and how a single photo could capture the essence of a place or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, and as long as I had film in my camera, there was a chance I might. My routine was simple: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for that perfect shot. This had been my way for a long time.

I once got lucky with a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well. It became popular, appearing in newspapers and magazines worldwide. That brief success led me to go freelance, which seemed like a smart move. However, life outside photography didn't go as planned, and the mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped, even after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad.

The Vienna assignment came by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job, and they offered it to me. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was happy to go because things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna sounded good to me.

They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife during a busy summer, but this time, in cold January, it felt different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos. On the first day, I didn't take any pictures. Instead, I rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. The weather was cold and set, like the grand old buildings of the city. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons because I wanted this to be my Vienna. I waited for the right moment to take my photos.

The next morning, I was out at dawn. Fresh snow had made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot because its spire was tall and its base was massive. I might have to settle for a partial shot, but in that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even for the pioneers in the 19th century. Watching a photo develop in a dark room is mysterious, and that sense of mystery stays with you forever. So, when something unexpected happened at Stephansplatz that morning, it didn't really surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, flashy show, but rather a unique look into a nearly forgotten part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the 20th century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an ongoing, though often unnoticed, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for a long time, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are presented with little text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's charming personality and clever words, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but others argue that his popularity doesn't mean his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to judge his work by an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and understands that only time will tell his true place in art history.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

Recently, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by their claim to be art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but complemented each other through their differences. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might ruin their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the act of creativity. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Enjoying something doesn't mean we can't also understand it deeply. In fact, knowing more about what we see might increase our pleasure. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be questioned. It's also influenced by history. Our preferences are shaped by the values of the society we live in. While it's important to appreciate the sensory and instinctive responses to art, the idea that thinking undermines feeling is an outdated view from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people might have first been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like a regular stone, but it was beautiful. This is how gold might have become important to early humans. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a valuable material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and learned how to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which greatly improved their way of life.

**St Ives**  
We walked down the winding, cobbled street into the town, carrying our bags and leaning against the strong wind. The waves crashed over the promenade, and the streets were empty. All the windows in the waterfront cottages were shut tight against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. The dark grey skies made visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seem like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through good and bad times are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with real experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling helps us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how these virtual societies react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean trouble for the current leader. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, the leader gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The trick worked well until the leader made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking in the open, revealing his deception.

**What Cats Catch**  
In the English village of Felmersham, people collected the prey caught by their cats. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw these numbers and estimated that cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is misleading. Most cats live in towns, have smaller territories, and catch fewer prey than the rural cats in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations higher than natural levels. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand on the edge of the platform, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest there, making low sounds. Eventually, they start swimming, appearing almost submerged, with only their noses above water. They spend the day among the reeds, eating leisurely.

**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**  
In early 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The sea creatures look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping and interlocking transparent shapes. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors create a calm, underwater feel. However, there is tension in the painting, with fish showing their teeth and a crab with open claws, suggesting an impending battle. The sharp forms and even a chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,"Photography has been around for about 150 years and has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown in its ability to capture moments in time and space, allowing us to see both fleeting moments and vast or tiny details. It has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become a powerful way to express the human experience.

However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The earliest examples of pictorial recording date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early humans created cave paintings—whether they were recording real events, using them for magic to increase animals for hunting, serving as religious symbols, or simply to decorate their living spaces. But images have always been closely linked to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This was considered a natural phenomenon and a cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create by hand.

Because of photography's realistic nature, it was thought that everyone could understand photographs, leading to the idea of photography as a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even an isolated Bushman could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rise of global communication in the late 20th century, we must ask if photography can truly cross cultural differences. Is photography as culturally bound as language? Has our familiarity with photos made us overlook the medium's ability to convey reality?

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representation. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming part of ""mythic time,"" where photos have become historical documents, revealing much about the people and society that created them.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not just reflect culture; it can inspire social and political change. For example, the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance were influenced by new ways of visual representation, like perspective. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world in a way that is accessible to many."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Explaining how to write poetry is tricky. It's like walking through a minefield: you need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move and your ideas can fall apart. Claiming to know everything is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners focus on reading a lot, writing often, and freeing their imagination in any productive way, without going into chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can write even when they're unhappy. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid as long as they aren't just copying someone else's rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there's no space for too many characters or long narratives. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly and keeps the reader interested. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but that doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. Conflict and action should be as strong in a short story as in a novel, but every word must count in the limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing the outcome, seeing only a few moves ahead. Over time, they realize that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves, and recognize patterns like openings, middle games, and end games. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin noted that humans naturally speak, as seen in children's babbling, but writing is not instinctive. Language exists in all societies, past and present, and while languages change, they don't necessarily improve. All healthy children learn to speak without formal lessons. When children lack a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and has evolved slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle. Children naturally learn to speak, but reading and writing are skills that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works, how children's minds work, and how to connect the two."
CPE_8,"I have never started writing a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to name it. I have a small story to share, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader with an open ending. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between those times. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write down what I know. To avoid causing problems for people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story made-up names, and I've taken care to ensure no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about isn't famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more impact on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read at all, it will be for its own interest. But maybe the life he chose and his unique character will influence others, and long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source for my friend's future biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I've included are exact quotes. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for things that matter to me. Although I've written these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but like historians, I've added speeches to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. Intelligent readers will notice where I've used this technique, and they can choose to ignore it if they wish. Another reason I'm nervous about this book is that the people I'm writing about are from a different culture. It's hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really understand your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they enjoyed, and the poets they read. These experiences make them who they are, and you can't fully understand them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only truly know them if you are one of them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I've done so in short stories, it's because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It's only later that we can see patterns and recognize which works are important. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and opinions about what poetry should be and how it should be shared. 

Currently, there is a debate in poetry between two groups. One group consists of serious 'literary' poets who write poems to be read on the page. The other group includes 'popular' poets who enjoy performing their poems in front of an audience. This division isn't strict, and many poets do both.

Public poetry readings have become more common over the last twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often expected to perform their work publicly, which has mixed results for them.

For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live performances, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique can become obvious.

On the other hand, poets who focus on crafting their work with depth and complexity might not be fully appreciated in a live setting. These poets aim to pack a lot of emotion, thought, and rhythm into their work, which can be missed if the audience is hearing it for the first time. The risk is that they might choose to read only their simpler poems to connect quickly with the audience.

Listening to poetry readings is not a replacement for reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm intended by the poet. It's helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's unrealistic to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status compared to the interviewee and the historian's way of understanding history, which might affect the interviewee's responses. Historians must acknowledge their role in shaping new evidence. Even without the historian, the interviewee's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions in the testimony can seem convincing but might not be from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

Animal science can be studied in two main ways: focusing on the body's functions or looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of the animal as a whole and what influences it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs, studying how animals like rats and pigeons learn. Ethologists study natural, instinctive behavior, often in wild settings. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more basic. However, understanding nerve cells alone isn't enough; we also need to study behavior as a whole. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cell actions is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely linked. We might think social sciences are just common sense because we all experience social life. However, each social science goes beyond common sense, focusing on specific aspects of social life, using particular study methods, and employing unique concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, helping social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function aren't part of his initial definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins, with a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These early forms contributed to later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-room structure."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. She would finish her drive near the gasworks, surrounded by the smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found out and was amused by Lily's secret driving. He praised her, saying, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought men were strange because Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of the next month, as it was the quietest day of the week. They planned to leave early and return by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

An hour after leaving home, they reached the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded her. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she preferred to pay a parking fee rather than risk getting towed or fined. This cautiousness might have reassured Mui. During the drive, Lily noticed Mui's tense face in the mirror and decided not to mention any worries that hadn't occurred to Mui.

Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""Don't worry, no one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too proud and easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He lifted Man Kee onto the railing and held him. Man Kee was a warm, responsive child and put his hand on Chen's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way, ensuring he got a good education in business and eventually owned many restaurants. The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future.

Chen saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece and said, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It's a special ship for people like us. It's small and old, but we know it's the ship that will take us home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. Chen said, ""The little old ship. Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls following the ship's path."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the edge, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle, but as soon as the bucket left the wall, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had sort of achieved my goal. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was just dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I waited a bit, then climbed out of the well and onto the courtyard stones. I heard worried voices from the castle. I ran the other way, hiding in the shadows near the moat bridge. Mother and Father came out with you and old Arthur; Mother was panicking, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was horrified. The drops were visible in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one had seen them. Mother was screaming, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. It had gone from a clever idea to a big problem that wouldn't go away without someone, probably me, getting in trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. From a smart plan to a disaster in minutes. Then I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding spot, pretending to be weak and dizzy. I called out softly, then louder when no one noticed. I stumbled forward and collapsed dramatically. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I pretended to be relieved and said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it to escape. I thought I was convincing them until Father asked me to repeat the story. I did, but hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Trying to cover up, I said the tunnel collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking. I claimed the well was dangerous and I barely survived. I looked into my father's eyes and felt like I was looking into a dark tunnel with no stars. It was like he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how adults view children's lies. My words stopped. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked at me, disappointed, not because of my adventure or that my father didn't believe me, but because he saw through my lie and worried about my character. His pity was as painful as my father's words, showing that this was the adult judgment of my actions, not something I could ignore. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything unique about her house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house with a view of a small harbor. Memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked how they would bring the house home. Now, Robert was helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Her daughter Francesca was also there, insisting she was the only one careful enough to handle their Steinway piano.

Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry, which surprised her. He explained that many people cry when they see their homes being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place. Susan could understand that feeling.

Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The removal team struggled for hours, and Francesca, who loved music, was upset. Her late husband, Peter, solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to lift the piano inside. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said the piano would stay there forever, but forever is a long time.

Now, Susan's children were busy, and she found it hard to move around the house. She realized she should have warned the movers about the piano, but it was too late. As they prepared to move the piano, Susan felt anxious. Fred reassured her, and Robert and Francesca watched from the hallway.

Susan was on the verge of tears, realizing how much the objects in her home meant to her now that they were being moved. But when the piano was successfully carried out of the house, Robert started laughing, and soon all three of them were laughing uncontrollably, relieved that the move was over. As they left the house arm in arm, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

**Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Harmless Fun?**

From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or start a music channel online. In practice, though, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon's approach was simple: anyone could write a review and rate a book up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, instead of just reading the publisher's blurb or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores with physical stores offered similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon attracted the most customers and reviews, and thus faced the most issues.

This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, so it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors checked that reviews followed Amazon's guidelines. Reviews with just one word, personal attacks on the author, or those with obscenities, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and problematic reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This allowed for some mischief. For example, writers could give their own books positive reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was upset by bad reviews of his first novel and wrote several positive ones himself. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and the fake reviews were removed.

Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link saying, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses to communicate directly with readers. However, Amazon did not verify if the comments truly came from the authors, except for famous ones. A lesser-known writer once pretended to be John Updike, calling himself ""talented but over-hyped,"" but this was quickly removed as a fake.

The real drama came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit,"" about a cheerleading team, was published, it was praised by the mainstream press. But many people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon's page to express their anger. Many critical reviews were submitted but disappeared after a few days. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. Since reviews were meant to be a ""forum to talk about a book,"" Amazon closely monitored bestselling books to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One review humorously compared the book's plot to Internet architecture.

However, such silliness was rare. Most reviews on Amazon were taken seriously by their writers. Overall, these reviews provided a surprisingly accurate idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once complained that reviewing too many books meant inventing reactions to books he didn't care about. This makes the democratization of the review process seem like a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often express these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation can make us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in today's art. We see artists as separate from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that cannot be contained by conventions. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, making it part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist chooses a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any fancy lettering. The question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th, there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and trying something new can upset them. Gallery owners prefer safe bets, and the art-buying public often seeks comfort in continuity. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully broken this mold. Eric Rimmington is another artist challenging expectations. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington has always been fascinated by railways. After drawing the railway land of London's Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, he naturally moved to explore the underground world. His exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique magic of this hidden world designed for people on the move.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word 'escape' because the villagers jokingly say only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes from the village each day to clean the house, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in memories. I spoke about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of my work as a painter or writer is that in the silence, reality can be reordered and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the true beauty underneath. For artists, art offers a joyful way to deal with what has hurt or defeated us in life, not to avoid our destiny like ordinary people, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you'll get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to act confident. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, pulling himself together, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw different career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need.

That was not all. As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, the dynamic energy, the perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being extremely careful with their money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had been successful in his legal cases, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for their social and professional status. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him resentful. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated with care and respect after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their incomes.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset when she confronted Simon. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a case four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He was filled with guilt and remembered feeling similar shame in his school days. He wished he had been prepared and could have responded differently. 

Venetia's anger and disgust puzzled him. He wondered why she was so upset and what right she had to judge him. He questioned whether her own actions were always perfect. He feared that if the accusations spread, even as rumors, his career would be ruined."
CPE_36,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you don't feel like you're living a real life. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I'm watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back the plants. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested in them. I have her latest book with me now. 'How's the writing going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't really want her in the garden, which now looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the garden. 'I should have been a teacher. Writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What are your plans for the holidays?' she asks. 

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days, hot pavements, and loneliness in the park. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she will be around. 'Where will you stay? A nice B&B?' 'No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' This isn't true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and rejection letters to hers. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say, sounding old-fashioned. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 

Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel linked to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond personal stories, there is a broader need to understand our past to help us shape our future, both individually and as a nation. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the future by understanding the past. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we might not like, it is still part of us and provides a sense of belonging. Heritage teaches us a lot and is crucial for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. In the past, stories and legends from our ancestors connected us to our history. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities and families, leading to the loss of many oral traditions. Now, places and buildings serve as reminders of our past. It is essential to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became a key element. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the Fens, chose this setting. The simple answer is that I saw the Fens as a blank canvas for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not just flat and empty. They are uniquely English yet strangely foreign, a place that feels both cultivated and wild, open yet mysterious. Although I didn't visit many places in the Fens while writing, I relied on my imagination. The Fens are not just a physical landscape but also a state of mind, as shown in Edward Storey's book.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be engaging, using creative techniques to capture visitors' attention and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artifacts, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this role and offer exciting displays and outreach programs will find that digital history can actually increase interest in the real experiences they provide.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly now that everyone feels their impact. This can turn some people into strong preservationists and make others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that people who have lived through major events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things, as stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not a threat if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**  
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products that are linked to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't really know what Einstein did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which marked the start of modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe in a new, more logical way by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking basic concepts like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**  
When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be serious and, therefore, boring. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would hint at her disapproval, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also sneak in a few high-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of these books as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**  
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mysterious origin has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller suggested that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad. A person walking through a dangerous land with scary animals might have made desperate noises, and languages have kept some of these sounds, like the word malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of such odd theories, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's idea that language is a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them relevant for only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, think that reviewing is a job done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a complex and skilled task. Writing a concise and fair review in 600 to 800 words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed 6,000 to 8,000-word piece for an international journal. A 1,500-word article in a weekly magazine combines challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer should know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who isn't fond of criticism—calling it ""hugging the shore""—still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think less famous writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, there's no reason they shouldn't enjoy some recognition if they believe their best work is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, there's no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days when academics criticized professors for writing reviews are mostly over. Complaints from non-academics that professors are taking their jobs are also less common, partly because there's more reviewing work available now, and partly because the pay is often low. I believe this situation benefits both readers, who can trust the reviewer knows the subject, and professors, as it helps them stay grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-academics. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when speaking to intelligent non-academics. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, still hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a brief doubt about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, curious about what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat vandalized, though he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the artificial world of the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but once he escaped, he felt empty and waited in vain for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that doing work he didn't enjoy had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music as the night went on, but he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed to get lost in his mind. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first opportunity that came along, as if it was meant to be. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he wasn't surprised to find that he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find happiness in his work. He went to his only job interview with gratitude and didn't think to evaluate the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see a goat race. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through crowds, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was heading to the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was marked off for the race. It wasn't like a professional racecourse, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch the goats run. Keeping the goats in order was a challenge because they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I worried about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used a torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you're saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start your presentation by finding common ground with your audience and build towards your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities simply cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you're impatient while making mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some mental tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing mental math faster. But others cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or become more complicated, like the fishing line. Saying 'Think fast; we need the results' can be as unwise as trying to sleep for only half the time you need. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds, suitable for different tasks. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. Both are true. Generally, the mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate, instinctive reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London years ago, my brain and body quickly coordinated a series of movements that kept me safe. Only after it was over did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast, instinctive intelligence could be called our 'wits'. Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, building arguments, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won't start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment all use this type of intelligence, which relies on reason and logic. We often call this 'intellect'. Someone good at these tasks is called 'bright' or 'clever'. But there is another, slower mental process. It is often less focused, more playful, leisurely, or dreamy. In this mode, we are thinking deeply or reflecting; being contemplative or meditative. Sitting on a rock by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind time to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. On the contrary, slow thinking is an important part of our mental abilities. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed, open mental attitude. Recent scientific studies show that these patient, less deliberate ways of thinking are especially good for understanding complex, unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options might be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask—or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought—we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and even 'wisdom'. Poets have long understood the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists begun to study these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of 'cognitive science' is showing that the unconscious mind can do many unusual, interesting, and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote area. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my confidence. I felt a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to join, worried about the silence when I spoke, feeling anxious like I did in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just another young author, and he didn't pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face, and when we met again, he would shake my hand warmly, but he didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often pretend not to see me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, because my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are affected by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly to have an emotional impact, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or intellectual ideas, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This might seem like the best time ever for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Today, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can turn into clouds that block the sun and make it hard to observe the sky at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, society has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. People always want the newest product or service, and technology makes everything change faster. New products come out all the time, making it hard to keep up. This can be stressful and make life feel disconnected. More choices mean more stress and less time. People are now looking for ""simplexity""—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and too many software updates and phone plans to follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It's a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it's very important to us. We don't let anything disrupt this ritual. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I don't like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them around the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. This respect for privacy is rare in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

An outstanding production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London, giving me a chance to correct a previous unfair review. When the show first opened last spring, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the role of Othello and underestimated his acting skills. Although I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important to the story, I must admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is truly remarkable. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include Cassio's dangerous games with other young officers and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is particularly moving and might bring tears to your eyes. The production maintains great pace and tension throughout. Don't miss it.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, there is no movement. While the edges of the continent are full of penguins, seals, and birds, the vast white interior is lifeless. However, beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice lies Lake Vostok, a huge hidden freshwater lake directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its depths to find out what unusual organisms might live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, scientists from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If successful, the next few years could be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to pursue science. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's about the quest for knowledge and understanding everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists are curious about why we want to know these things in the first place and why science can't explain this desire. It seems more important to consider whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in debates about the purpose of it all. The key issue should be recognizing that science is a tool, and we must decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too much sugar and preservatives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And few people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were stuffed in desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. Owning an apartment building added even more paperwork. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had vandalized the place. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her eyes showed she wasn't going to help with the office mess. She believed he was like a visitor from another world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn streets.

**KAREN**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later told her. The club missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty walked quickly across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's exciting to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, helping her with her yearly laryngitis, which was her only health issue. She appreciated how he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to give his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are so captivating that even someone who claims to be tone-deaf would be moved. Watching her play is like seeing a pianist test the limits of human ability. However, at a recent concert for children, one boy was not impressed until she played the theme from ""Match of the Day."" For him, that was the real test of her skills. Joanna found this amusing and passed the test with ease.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has published her own beginner piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even though she has a very busy work schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and is involved in a collaboration with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves working on joint projects with other artists. So why did she decide to write a book? Joanna believes that the first lessons are very important. She thinks that the music profession often focuses too much on creating child prodigies, while most people have a more everyday interest in music, which she finds more interesting.

Joanna's experience in teaching comes from her early years. Before she became a concert pianist, she taught beginners how to play the piano. Her childhood was filled with other children learning music at her home, where her mother taught piano. This experience shaped her belief that music should be accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent. She thinks everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children learn quickly, but she is more interested in those who progress at different rates and sometimes give up. This can happen at any stage, often because of frustration or pressure to meet high expectations.

Joanna is careful not to criticize other piano teaching books or teachers. Her books are colorful and engaging, but she acknowledges that there are many good books available. Her unique approach is to include a storyline in her books and CDs to make learning fun. From the first lesson, there are different styles of accompaniments for teachers or parents to play along with the child. If parents can't play the piano, the accompaniments are available on CDs. Joanna insists that learning should be fun and encourages improvisation and exploration of the keyboard.

As children progress, they face bigger challenges, like learning to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes practice is the most important factor. She admits she didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she had to practice to handle difficult contemporary pieces. Now, she enjoys practicing and considers it the core of her musical life, even more important than performing. She sympathizes with those who find practice difficult and believes it's not discussed enough. Her advice is to plan what you want to achieve in each practice session, reward yourself by playing through a piece, and mix difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is often not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is difficult to achieve. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they have very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is physically hard, which makes you think more carefully. You write with care because it's hard to change or erase what you've written. On the other hand, using a computer can make you careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and tend to exaggerate. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was plain, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's incredible they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi system. He pressed a button, and a small tray came out. He placed the disc inside and pressed the button again, and the tray went back in. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway. Let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd think they were a great improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say electronic text is as big a change as the invention of printing and that it's almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This kind of talk is self-centered, thinking our generation is at the peak of history. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. So far, that hasn't happened. Reading long texts on a screen is so unpleasant that most people avoid it. Also, the way information is organized on computers makes people skim through text. Some tech enthusiasts say this leads to new ways of storytelling. But there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, aren't read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text in one go.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was free of the papers that had covered it since it was laid down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Lancelot's secretary shouted, ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" She wasn't really asking because she had been making him coffee for months. She often forgot things because he wasn't supposed to be there regularly. However, he was there all the time now because staying away led to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work.

His secretary handed him a folder, saying it was from someone in Los Angeles and that he wanted to see it. The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert"" and ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want another synopsis; he wanted a first draft. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, and Lancelot regretted commissioning books from friends. Ian was unpredictable and had not delivered the manuscript.

Lancelot skimmed the synopsis, recognizing almost every phrase. He set it aside, realizing Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt uninspired. Lancelot remembered a famous author who had to be paid for each chapter to finish his book, but Ian had already received a large advance. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre, but Ian's potential remained untapped.

Ian was difficult to work with, even when he was influential. He was supposed to edit an arts magazine but never published an issue, using up the budget. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary, which increased to encourage him to work. At editorial meetings, Ian was critical and sarcastic. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to admit that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake."
CPE_65,"England's breakfast change

Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, in England, breakfast is a relatively new tradition. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are a few mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people, except for kings and nobles, did not eat breakfast. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common for everyone. Some people think this change happened because there was more food available. However, they often overlook other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working fixed hours, often starting very early in the morning. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might think they understand the photos they see. However, instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was. Does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a broader situation?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus entirely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you must prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows individual excellence, yet it's a team game, so you must balance both. It's like life—you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot—not just money. It has opened doors and my eyes, letting me see things worldwide that others might not. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they stand out clearly in our memories. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt drawn into a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through my window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Birds have always been important in human culture. They are loved, feared, and even worshipped. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. Wrens are seen as mysterious birds, linked to omens and predictions. Is this wren trying to send a message from a world beyond our understanding? Or is it simply a bird trapped in a greenhouse? Both interpretations could be true, depending on how you see it. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens are still found in British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. A forest without wrens feels empty and sad. This connection to birds is part of a long tradition of folklore, which dates back to when people relied on nature for survival. 

Our views on birds can change over time. For example, in the early 1500s, red kites were common in London and were seen as helpful scavengers. But later, they were considered pests and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain.

Our relationship with birds goes back to our early ancestors. They watched birds closely because birds could warn of danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected people to the spiritual world. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and wish to emulate. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of us, like our appendix or wisdom teeth.

Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is concerning not just because of the loss of these birds, but also because of the cultural loss. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings, representing love and magic. Their decline is felt deeply by those familiar with literature and folklore.

Folklore is important because it keeps stories and legends alive, connecting us to the past. These stories have a stronger bond with their subjects than scientific terms do. They evoke feelings and attitudes buried under modern life. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we don't fully understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages.

The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding a mystery in its song and flying into the future, leaving us to wonder."
CPE_28,"Maps are tools that show how different points and features on the earth relate to each other, mainly through distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like ""a day's journey,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through an area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who just wanted to know where to go and how far it was. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, sometimes more so than maps. Even today, some maps, like those of train systems, don't always show true directions. Early maps used symbols to show landmarks, and these symbols varied depending on the map's purpose and location. Understanding these symbols is key to studying old maps.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details to maps. Over time, cartography has used other sciences to help. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, maps became more detailed. Astronomers found that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.

The needs of map users have changed over time. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for artillery use, which required showing the land's surface features accurately. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps for their work, each with specific requirements. Today's cartographers create maps showing various distributions, like geological layers and climate patterns. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.

The development of maps has not been a smooth, continuous process. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid development. Sometimes, old ideas persisted alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what was needed for progress but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it was easier to copy old maps, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them valuable records for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"TIM RICE

I was invited into a young man's living room, which felt like a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms around it where his less ambitious family members spent their time. Moving from the kitchen to his living room felt like going from economy to business class on a flight. In this room, I saw the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprisingly, a teenager who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't a matter of life or death, although it's easy to say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I was willing to try. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for instant praise for his music and a real, released seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier, which ended their failing career. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact on musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we didn't succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the brief certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would, of course, keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and would write a few more simple songs that wouldn't show the limitations of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't really inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, owing too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his score's brilliance was infectious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title as well, most of which had probably been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have an amazing ability: we can communicate with each other in a very precise way. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a smart spider or need special training; it's just something they do naturally.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which make up the climate over time, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing. The atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the air is on a spinning Earth, and since air is light, it doesn't move as fast as the Earth spins. The sun is an even more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks, but I was most worried about making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning a lot about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be sent back to simpler tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get good at it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail to make good programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These subjects should be perfect for TV because cameras can show an entire artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a reliable critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I thought the series would focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a global free-market economy. However, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis available. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**

At the Bamboo Bike Club in Hackney Wick, east London, you can spend a weekend building your own custom bamboo bike frame. This unique workshop is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. On a Saturday morning, the sound of machinery fills the air as participants gather to start their bike-building adventure.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike frames, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, these ready-made frames can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable and accessible, so they spent years developing a product that cyclists could build themselves.

Their goal was not just to sell bike frames but to share the joy of creating something unique and sustainable. The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business, as both James and Ian have full-time jobs—James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. Despite this, their monthly courses are popular, offering a custom-designed bike frame and a fun weekend experience at a competitive price.

For someone like me, who struggles with DIY projects, the quality of the final product was a concern. On the first day, participants learn how to choose strong bamboo and form solid joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes together to create the bike's frame, with metal parts added for areas needing extra strength. James and Ian are always on hand to help, ensuring every cut and joint is perfect.

Most participants enjoy the challenge of building their own bike, and many are engineers. But even if you make mistakes, it's easy to try again with another piece of bamboo. Each piece is checked for quality, and you can choose from different styles like plain, black, or mottled bamboo.

Sunday is more relaxed, focusing on wrapping hemp bindings around the joints and securing them with epoxy resin. This creates a strong, durable frame. After a final waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other personal touches. These bamboo bikes are built to last, as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his bike for over a year on a long commute, and James has tested his off-road without any issues.

While bamboo bikes might look a bit rough compared to professional frames, they have a unique charm. They are perfect for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' style for a smooth, easy-going experience. The bikes ride well, absorbing vibrations for a comfortable journey.

James believes the real joy comes when the bike is on the road. They are light, easy to ride, and a lot of fun. And the best part? The cost is less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how men and women can communicate better is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans improve their lives, but it also takes advantage of their desires for self-improvement. It supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books that seem exaggerated or fake. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. This is a relief. Editors are always looking for the next big hit, focusing on how marketable a book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions. She admits, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's most of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers might leave out things they find too embarrassing or unimportant. There are also more complex reasons for not telling the whole truth. An autobiographer might think that inventing stories can show the truth about themselves better than sticking to the facts. Or they might decide from the start not to follow the truth. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without being cynical.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Experts say detective stories became popular because they reflect the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it shows how society can function smoothly again. In Hammett's stories, society returns to its old ways, but it is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same coin. They understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The detective is both a crook and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his connection to the criminal, and sometimes his desire to punish is stronger because of this connection.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To talk about his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said, ""I couldn't write about a place like this. Trollope might, but he knew the culture. Understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. Science is like its own civilization. Only scientists can present it well. If you don't live in the community and don't know its rules, you're at a disadvantage."" One of Gould's rules is to never talk down to the reader. ""Don't make concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but not the argument. If readers feel patronized, your piece fails."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym in the City of London, the air feels very cold. The gym has turned up the air-conditioning too much to cope with the unusually high summer temperatures. At quiet times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It has become a key part of both work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple methods can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is not surprising that as we enter a new millennium, there is a renewed interest in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping clocks accurate. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just decorative garden items, seen as outdated in a modern technological world. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago. There, serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with precise brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke was perfect. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed like these women had either practiced for many years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners also have natural artistic skills? In reality, the class was not intimidating at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly and perfectly as I had seen before."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent mentioned that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Due to a mistake, either at the travel agency or at the airport, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland, at a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they arrived, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith assumed it was part of the plan. It was almost midnight when they reached the hotel, and they were too tired to question anything. The next morning, they realized they were supposed to stay there for the whole holiday, which worried them.

The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly explained that they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help.

A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, approached them. Dawne explained they were in the wrong hotel. Mrs. Franks explained that Your-Kind-of-Holiday had many destinations and that all tickets and labels looked similar. She laughed, saying it was unlikely they would end up in the wrong place.

Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing there, and the receptionist was gone. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that had happened.

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, approached them, saying they had slept well because of the lakeside air. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape such responsibilities. Uncle had insisted on this holiday for them, even though they had tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**He Was a People Person**

American business leaders are now looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a great example of good leadership. Eluned Price reports.

In Britain, many people know about Sir Ernest Shackleton and his achievements. However, in America, he is only now becoming well-known. The Wall Street Journal once described him as an ""Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing a lot of interest in him. Books about Shackleton and his famous ship, the Endurance, are being written and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a movie about his life.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and learn leadership and communication lessons from his story. They even use the term ""speaking Shackleton"" to describe their approach. Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has been inspired by Shackleton for years. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises, like when a company's plant explodes or when many employees are laid off. MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great example of leadership and communication. Shackleton was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of his most important decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole in 1908. This decision showed his commitment to his men's safety.

In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. Unlike some managers today who avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Shackleton told his men they would reach safety if they trusted him and did their best. From their diaries, it's clear that Shackleton was always in control.

Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible and ready to start over if needed. MacGregor says Shackleton's story helps clients understand leadership without feeling criticized.

Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that in America, people often want quick solutions, but sometimes it's better to wait. For example, if you invest in bonds and the interest rates change, it's better to hold on rather than sell at a loss. Similarly, if a product isn't selling, don't keep pushing it.

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, insisting he wear them. On a previous expedition, when they were starving, Shackleton offered his last biscuit to someone else, showing his selflessness.

Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says that people today are increasingly interested in heroic stories. Shackleton represents the ideals we long for, standing out as a true hero."
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that has a lifestyle similar to a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae hidden in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects.

Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently discovered how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her daughter Annabelle. He wanted to see if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood's surface, like holes where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several drilled holes. Some holes led to cavities with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the cavities with food, showing they didn't need visual clues like surface holes. Dr. Erickson then tested if they used smell or sound to find the insects. Even when the smell was blocked, and the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them.

Dr. Erickson discovered that the aye-ayes could sense the cavities themselves. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and focuses its large ears forward. Dr. Erickson suggests that the aye-aye uses echo-location, listening for echoes from the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role might not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat. It also behaves like a squirrel, as its incisors grow continuously, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells to get the nut meat with its long finger."
CAE_19,"Title: 'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'

Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we really know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories give us only small, incomplete glimpses. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they still only show part of the story.

Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary lives. The idea came to her when she realized how much of her own family's past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy the process.""

The promise of privacy helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man, who made and lost a fortune, shared his story. ""I was surprised at what I revealed. Some things were painful, like my divorce,"" he says. ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. If they insist, I will, but I'd prefer they read it after I'm gone.""

He noticed patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""It's amazing how much people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things parents say and do affect their children for life. People often marry someone their parents would approve of, or they rebel and do the opposite.""

Many people still feel disappointed about unresolved issues with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who was never impressed, and some want to say, ""I can't stand my mother.""

Ms. Renier acts as a recorder, not an interrogator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to pry. People sometimes share things and then doubt if it should be included. I include it anyway, and they can decide later if they want to remove it. But generally, people want to be honest.""

""It's not about vanity or thinking the world needs to know about their life. Things are changing fast, and we're losing touch with the past. This gives people a connection to their ancestors. People want a little immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing and interpreting the information. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the book's binding. The final product is high quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost deters many. ""I thought it would be more affordable,"" she says. ""But my clients are often well-off, the kind who might have had portraits painted for their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few remaining collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of the sculptures here are original; they are all precise copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

We have a membership program that allows all our members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to improve their skills with our Young Members program, led by our resident photographer. We sell photographic books and magazines and have a full range of photographic materials.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has an impressive collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and from all over the world. It also holds Britain's oldest complete geological collection, belonging to Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens kept in their original early 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, greatly expanded the collections, creating the foundation of an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to trace major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays the beautiful minerals and gems from the collection, with detailed labels explaining their nature and modern uses.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
This collection has over 400,000 air photographs, both oblique and vertical, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human impact from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff are happy to answer questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These are made to order and typically take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world and is a unique tourist attraction in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center has preserved the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, used as an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many of the beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Paternity**

**A. The Theatre Director**

I have had 35 years of being around small children due to my unusual personal life, and I have loved every moment of it. This morning, I fed the baby, and to me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I have become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite annoying. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I have always appreciated. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I might have lost touch with: music, youth culture, and fashion. This has been very helpful for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy building my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I'm sad about that, but now there are benefits, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies with us without feeling shy. I think it's an advantage that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a real issue. I make sure that I only accept weekend meetings and public appearances where there are facilities for one or more of the kids to come with me. If I didn't, they would just be left out. This way, they understand what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of Daddy disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more aware of the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I had to think more deeply about fatherhood than I might have otherwise. I made great efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wished, but I think Kate and Bonnie would say now that they found that quite confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. It's true I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining just the other day that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more structure and order. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I had turned 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending our money on new sofas every Saturday when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me come to terms with who I am. You feel you are doing something very special when you have a child, and you are. But you are also becoming just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. I do get annoyed sometimes, but if ever there is a moment of irritation, it goes away with just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest way to make you feel better. It can melt a grown man."

Barry Faville writes with humor and confidence, bringing his New Zealand setting to life. Robbie, the narrator, takes a job gardening for Stanley, an elderly man. At first, Robbie finds Stanley fascinating, but later repellent. When Robbie discovers what Stanley keeps in his aquarium, the story takes a thrilling turn while still exploring character and relationships. It's unusual and compelling.

**Dodger** by Libby Gleeson  
This is a sad story about Mick's troubled personal relationships and difficult school life. The story is told through flashbacks, a teacher's letters, Mick's notes, and a sympathetic narrative. Mick learns to overcome others' negative expectations and his own low self-esteem through a role in a school play and the help of a sensitive teacher. It's highly recommended, though it's a painful read, especially at the end."
CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular airplane. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the inside was different, and the 13 students from Europe and America were about to have an extraordinary experience. Inside, the plane was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat. They had spent 12 months competing with other students across the continent for a chance to be on this flight. The European Space Agency challenged them to propose creative experiments to conduct in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which was like an incredible roller-coaster ride.

For the next two hours, the Boeing's flight would mimic a giant bird flying erratically, soaring upwards and then diving towards Earth. The goal was to create a moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In the brief seconds between rising and falling, the plane and everything inside became weightless, and the 13 students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The plane took off smoothly, but any thoughts that we were on a regular flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines stopped, and we instantly felt weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; directions like left, right, up, or down no longer made sense. Only gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand the concept of moving somewhere else.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. The return of gravity was not as immediate as its loss, but it was sudden enough that some students landed with a thud. With the first curve completed, some students turned pale at the thought of 29 more to come. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students quickly began studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to understand how cats always land on their feet. They released the device, which floated belly-up, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. However, during a less controlled return to gravity, another student accidentally landed on top of it.

Next to the slightly dazed robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joins is affected by the lack of gravity, with future space station construction in mind. Another team from Utah State University explored the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity. They believe that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation, similar to how a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unsettled, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This was an experience that would stay with us for a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer in the UK, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my siblings and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was special since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very fertile, but it was good for planting trees.

I've always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees appealed to me. I was eager to start, and my family became enthusiastic as we progressed. We began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted all 70 acres.

In 1968, New Zealand had a very rainy winter. It rained almost every day while we were planting, and I was often wet and cold. Each morning, I faced the challenge of getting ready for another day of planting. I would step out of the Land Rover, already damp from the previous day, with wet boots and slippery laces. During this time, I had many thoughts and reflections about life.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. We used a planting bag filled with as many trees as possible. The bag was heavy at first, but it got easier as it emptied. The hardest part was keeping the planting lines straight. We used three poles to mark the lines and planted along them. I enjoyed the physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, planting became automatic, and I developed a rhythm. It was a regular process: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, planting it, and moving on.

Mentally, it was interesting. My mind wandered, and I started thinking about the natural world and our place in it. These thoughts have influenced my life ever since. I've returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which is satisfying. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand, but the trees have done well and are now 20 years old.

In 1984, I took a break from teaching and spent three months alone in New Zealand. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, in a simple cabin on the tree farm. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. I still feel a strong connection to that place. It's where I feel most connected to the earth, and it's a powerful bond."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

When one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box, my first thought was, ""What now?"" My husband Derek and I had turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, and we had become known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix between a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar to me. Curious, I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their coats felt like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by building contractors who accidentally dug into their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still nursing. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the mother’s licking. This helped them empty their bowels and bladder. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum,"" they seemed content.

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, although he was still eating normally. It was a warning sign I missed. The next morning, I found him dead. A vet's post-mortem revealed Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics, in such a small animal. Disheartened by my failure, I continued caring for the others. Then, six days later, a local farmer who heard about our cubs brought me another male cub. He found it abandoned behind some silage bags. The mother wouldn’t return because the area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. Over the next few days, I discovered why his mother left him. He was very difficult to feed. To get him to drink, I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around in his mouth and squeezing it. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were weaned onto creamed rice and then anything else. Willow was different. He was happy to stop using the bottle but couldn’t eat without walking through his food, tipping it over, or sitting in it. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly chewed, played with, and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods.

At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my foundlings had become nocturnal and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the long grass was a playground. The cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur to look like snowballs, and chase each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we were part of this game. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, never did. His reactions to being caught were as colorful as his bruises. During these late-night walks in the dry period, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territories to find food, as badgers are very territorial and will kill intruders. We were warned they might climb into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure.

The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so great that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walking direction. It had three chambers, one slightly larger, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened enclosure. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they forgot about the walks, excited by climbing through the tunnels and arranging bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. These days, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they’re not fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose occasionally (she joined a neighboring sett), but Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to greet us before dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"Text: 'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his major achievements was mapping 'compass variations' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't accurately correct their compasses, making it hard to determine longitude and navigate the seas. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at the time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, past South Georgia, up to Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it outdated. Dr. Clark, who also loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during a two-year stay at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' Dr. Clark says. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He wasn't just an astronomer; he also did geophysics research. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and found time for other interests.' During this time, Halley developed a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his book Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The planned expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more accurate instruments. These measurements need updating because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data collected will help improve the current mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It's common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. Coincidentally, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill any gaps in its coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and notes that ground-based measurements are useful for comparison. It's easy to forget how important Halley's Atlantic journey was. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue what many saw as an obsession with declination. Does Dr. Clark have the skills to make his voyage successful? Besides spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with four different crews. Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? 'I'm willing to dedicate eight months of my life to this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, how did such extravagant features evolve? Darwin believed that evolution happened through natural selection, where the strongest and most adaptable survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to contradict this idea because it is large and cumbersome. To explain this, Darwin proposed 'sexual selection,' suggesting that females choose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's colleague, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He thought that if peahens preferred showy tails, there must be a practical reason. Perhaps these tails indicated some hidden quality that helped survival. Wallace believed the tail was not just for show but a sign of a male's overall fitness.

Today, researchers like Marion Petrie at Whipsnade are trying to answer two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have other advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it just about appearance, as Darwin thought?

Observations at Whipsnade show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. These males attract more mates. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways. Some scientists, like William Hamilton from Oxford University, suggest that showy males might be healthier and free of parasites, but this hasn't been proven in Whipsnade's peacocks yet.

This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway.' It suggests that if females start preferring slightly better tails, over generations, this preference and the trait itself will grow stronger. This could lead to the extravagant tails we see today, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of impressive yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on a design change from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly anchored in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. You might think I'm a romantic dreamer, and maybe I am, but this boat uses both old-fashioned design and modern technology. 

Modern technology is essential in boat design and building today, but it often separates sailors from the real experiences of being at sea. These are the experiences they wanted to find by sailing. I'm not saying sailors should suffer through every hardship. I always make sure my boats have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. But why sail if every sail sets and furls itself automatically? Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of the adventure. 

Also, why move the steering from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot in the middle? The sad reason is to create a cabin like a luxury liner, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house. 

When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the former owner said it had every comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned how right he was. Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I've ever sailed. 

However, classic boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized I had to end my 15-year relationship with Hirta. I couldn't find a suitable younger boat, so I decided to build a new one. The Westerman has never let me down. Designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett used computer programs, but Irens first sketched the boat on a napkin. He then made a model, like in the old days. We refined the design using computers until it was perfect. 

The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails beautifully, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, not based on the furniture we might add. This traditional method works well. The Westerman shows that you don't need to follow trends to be satisfied and that history can teach us valuable lessons. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a traditional one."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places and share their experiences.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I needed a break. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors were very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff were friendly and professional, creating a lively and enthusiastic atmosphere. Henlow is planning to add a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or take a peaceful walk in the garden. By the end of my stay, I felt energetic and happy. I look forward to visiting again. This is a great place for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

From the moment I entered Shrubland Hall, I felt calm and relaxed. The hall has a beautiful library and conservatory, and plenty of space to be alone if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone gets a medical check-up, which includes weight and blood pressure checks. I was called a ""patient,"" which felt strange since I was healthy. However, they found a shoulder issue during the check-up, and the fitness instructor helped me work on it. Each person gets a specific diet plan. I lost weight without fasting, but I did get a headache from hunger on the second day. My meals included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and fruit with yogurt for dinner. If you're not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys Manor is not a health farm, but a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a large lounge. If you're watching your weight, you might want to skip the gourmet food, which includes rich sauces and creamy desserts made by a French chef. Luckily, there's a gym and pool to help burn off the calories. You can choose a health-conscious diet if you want to lose weight. The spa facilities include a bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. There's also a sports injury clinic where I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested exercises and massages. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, and the surrounding countryside is great for exploring. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. The estate has beautiful woodland walks and gardens. Waldo's, the restaurant, is famous for its delicious food. The menu is extensive, and the meals are wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding. After enjoying a meal, I spent time in the gym to burn off some calories. I also had a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments and beauty treatments if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's delicious but high in calories, which isn't great if you're trying to lose weight. The aromatherapy massage is also fantastic. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage. The modern facilities are well-run, with many therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. Guests include football teams, families, friends, and singles. I would love to visit here once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still over 98% the same as chimps. This means that what makes us different from animals is a recent development. Our ability to create art and other human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for just a few genes. 

Studies of animal behavior show that many traits we thought were unique to humans are not. For example, both chimpanzees and sea otters use tools. Chimps use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple languages with different sounds for predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. These findings suggest that the differences between us and animals are not as big as we once thought.

Art might be one of the few things that truly sets us apart. But if art is a unique human trait, it's strange that our ancestors didn't create it for most of our history. The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these don't last over time. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings and sculptures, only appears around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we say our recent creativity makes us different, how is our art different from animal creations? Three main ideas are often suggested: human art is not practical, it's made for beauty, and it's learned, not instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art can communicate ideas, it's not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps birds defend territory or attract mates, directly helping them reproduce. By this measure, human art is different.

Second, human art is often made for aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during mating season, suggesting they sing for practical reasons, not just for pleasure. This makes human art seem unique.

Third, human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human cultures have distinct art styles that are taught, not inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's music. In contrast, some birds are born knowing their species' song and would sing it even if they never heard it. It's like a French baby raised in Japan suddenly singing the French national anthem without being taught.

Human art changes quickly. Geese honked 2,000 years ago just as they do now, but human art evolves fast. Even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a piece. However, they might be fooled by works from two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 pieces in a day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their art was shown in a London gallery in 1957, and many pieces were sold, something many human artists can't claim.

These chimpanzee paintings blur the line between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they weren't made for practical reasons but for the artist's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's meant to communicate. However, some famous human art was also created for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"Title: A Big Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that hasn't been fully explored. It's also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to share his story. 

There aren't many big adventures or heroes left today. In the past, children's stories often featured brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes focused on distant horizons as they journeyed into the unknown. Nowadays, such people are rare in both fiction and real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore led an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored places on earth. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', and locals call it the Desert of Death. He shared the excitement and dangers of this incredible journey from the comfort of his home.

His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. However, the camel handlers turned out to be long-distance truck drivers who had never worked with camels before. This misunderstanding could have been deadly and threatened the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts. Charles Blackmore wrote a captivating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something to himself. 'I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I wanted to find out who I really was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried because no one had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took us 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was kind to us.'

Anyone reading about their crossing might question the use of the word 'kind'. The team faced severe challenges: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and losing part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at our limits and the camels hadn't had water for seven days, we found some. We didn't face the Taklamakan's famous sandstorms, and we avoided the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That's not to say we didn't face challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the heavily loaded camels, which often fell over onto us.'

'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn't allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was worried about my physical ability. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" At that moment, I was very scared.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'After walking 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've been through so much and have come so far. We were very thin but muscular and strong despite being exhausted. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'

In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I doubt myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to do that. As a personal achievement, I'm prouder of that expedition than anything else I've done. But in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- compared to that, the desert doesn't measure up.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I long for the challenge, the open spaces, and the sense of purpose. We were motivated by our goal. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Life was becoming overwhelming for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand again. Everyone loves technology because it gives us amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. We've been subtly convinced that technology is essential, and that's okay. But there are clear consequences. Using my hands doesn't consume the energy that our society wastes. Handcrafting doesn't harm the environment. A recent bad experience with my broken word processor, which cost me a lot to fix, made me realize that gadgets might not be worth the cost or hassle. Are we as reliant on technology as we think? Gradually, I've been letting household gadgets go as they break down. This makes me question what ""time"" technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? If so, marketing experts have tricked us. When my gadget started making strange noises, even when unplugged, I left it in the backyard, where it now sits like a ghost. I'm not stuck to a noisy machine, and I can take my time with my sewing. I was always a bit scared of those electric machines that rush towards your fingers. Best of all, I can put everything in a bag and take it with me. Of course, there are some gadgets I wouldn't want to live without. A year without a washing machine showed me the value of an electric one. But losing some gadgets has been surprisingly nice. We were watching too much TV, so I returned the rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. It's hard on the eyes but makes us focus on what's worth watching. Now, we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I stopped using my old sewing machine. It's now a plant stand, and since I can't afford a new one, I sew by hand. We've come to believe we can't live without technology, and even if we resist the idea that life would be impossible without it, we don't want to give it up. We feel sorry for past generations who had to do hard, tiring work. Even our brains get a break with computers that do fast calculations and entertain us. But the time I spend sewing by hand is not boring, and there are many benefits. I can sew and listen to the radio or talk with family and friends. If it's a simple task, I can watch TV and feel less guilty about sitting in front of it because I'm doing something useful. It's a cozy feeling to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea. I used to think sewing by hand was awful, imagining long hours and eye strain. But there's something soothing about handcrafting, and it's satisfying to see my work improve. Things get done quickly, and life slows down to the pace of my hands. I'm also free from the rush of modern life, where we hurry from one task to the next. I've taken back control of my sink, where I enjoy washing dishes and daydreaming. Now, I look around the house and wonder if we really need the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. We could save a lot of money by not using electric lights!"
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. When I visit his workshop in East London, he seems to be in a hurry. He greets me quickly and tells me to start the interview right away. It's not clear if he's naturally brusque or just shy. His workshop is busy, filled with half-made furniture and various types of wood. Hurst has been in this business for ten years and has a great reputation. He always has orders lined up for months, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want quality furniture like cupboards, tables, or bookcases, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker isn't hard, but finding one like Hurst, who focuses on clean, simple designs, is rare. Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes mass-produced, low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are key to his success. He confidently claims he has a natural ability for making things. Although he seems self-assured, he later shows a more humble side.

Hurst taught himself his craft by asking the right questions and learning as he went. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return for more pieces. He finds it satisfying to furnish an entire house. However, he admits that not all client relationships are smooth. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want.

While Hurst is proud of his work, he also praises others when deserved. He acknowledges that some craftsmen are better than him, even though he wasn't formally trained at a top design school. He criticizes craftsmen who take too long to make a single piece and students who try to make fashion statements with their furniture. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and useful, not just a statement.

Despite his confidence, Hurst is not pretentious. As I leave, he humbly remarks, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists still debate what exactly sleep does for us. There are three main theories. The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our body repairs itself and gets ready for the next day. The second theory focuses on the benefits of sleep for learning. It suggests that sleep helps us process and understand the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, learning would be difficult. The third theory is about energy. It suggests that we need sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who doesn't follow the usual rules of society. This makes us wonder, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own quirks, like entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about various topics. Eccentricity is about showing our uniqueness. Inside us, there's a constant struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong more than we want to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We want to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to be more individualistic and show our personality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said that when you truly believe in what you're doing and pursue it without giving up, you'll surprise many people. But this self-conscious individuality isn't eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a socialite makes shocking comments to get noticed, that's not eccentricity. However, if they keep doing these things until they can't go back to what most consider 'normal,' then they might be eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is being natural. Eccentrics don't try to be odd; they just are. True eccentrics don't care about public opinion; they aren't even aware of it. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all very aware of the world around them. Eccentrics, on the other hand, continue on their path without concern for society."
CAE_58,"Natural Books

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

A. Geoffrey Lean
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've been lucky to meet some of the key figures in the field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small but powerful woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences into a strong philosophy that made sense of the environmental movement for me as a young journalist. Picking her most important book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title, stands out. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes of her life's work. It's a passionate call for what we now call 'sustainable human development.' I've read many books since, but none match its impact.

B. Linda Bennett
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can almost hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their colony. This book brilliantly explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from seeming chaos to a well-organized social system. You can identify partners, boundaries, and families. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special. Ennion's art, based on years of observing birds, uses simple lines and colors to show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

C. Lee Durrell
""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that has most influenced my life. It not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation but also confirmed my love for the natural world. I first read it while researching animal sounds in Madagascar. Despite many challenges, reading this book each night made my world brighter. It beautifully combines animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done, but I prefer Gerald's view of the world as a family, with all its good and bad members connected. This is a concept we all need to understand.

D. Bruce Pearson
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion, which were described as having 'particular skill and charm.' These images captivated me. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds, which led me to start sketching them. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was just as valid as a scientific one. Since art was a stronger subject for me than math or physics, I saw new possibilities opening up."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here's what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are crucial for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers react differently to reviews. Both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are more relaxed about bad ones. They believe that any attention, whether good or bad, can boost sales as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviewing is better now than 40 years ago, being more varied and less elitist. However, paperbacks, which most people read, are often ignored. Weekly reviews aren't enough, and original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews as they help make books and authors known. A good review by a trusted reviewer can boost sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are vital for literary publishing. Without them, we would lose an essential source of support. We publish books by lesser-known authors who rely on reviews since we don't advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because readers trust them as unbiased opinions. Reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be combined with other factors like word-of-mouth, support from bookstores, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The link between publishing and reviewing in Britain is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can greatly impact a book's success. In Britain, bookshops don't always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes years of good reviews for a writer to gain readers. Yet, some poorly reviewed books sell very well. It's unpredictable. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to buy it after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more. Now, it's the surprise choice of reviewer or the review's strength, humor, or originality that can persuade someone to buy the book."
CAE_2,"The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith keeps this tradition alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who still make weathervanes by hand. Each of Graham's designs is unique and made to fit what his customers want. ""This way, I can create a special, personalized item,"" he says. Many of his customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want something unique that reflects the man's job or hobbies. This is quite different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise gift for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for weathervane designs,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes as a business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. ""My previous job wasn't creative, but this is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing."" Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval for the design before cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are just as popular as the custom ones. ""People like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They appreciate having something a bit different."" Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small, rural craft. ""I have found my niche in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I get a lot of satisfaction from turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,"" he explains. ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine."" Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients all over the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. ""The price,"" he explains, ""depends on how complex the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans brought him huge financial success. Here, he shares his inspiration and victory.

At the start of the year, things were tough for Nicholas Evans. He was a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. His year began poorly when a film project called ""Life and Limb,"" which he had been working on for months, suddenly failed. This left him worried because he hadn't earned any money for two years, and the film was his only hope to keep his bank manager happy.

Most people in Evans' situation would have looked for a job. He could have returned to being a TV executive or started a TV project he had paused. Instead, he made a bold decision that seemed crazy, even to him. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

Although this decision was impulsive, the idea for the story had been with him for a while. It started when he met a farrier on Dartmoor who told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These men were called ""horse whisperers,"" and Evans was fascinated.

Initially, Evans thought of writing a screenplay about it, as he was a filmmaker. But after ""Life and Limb"" failed, he decided to write a book instead. So, in the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them.

""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was watching people, but I felt alone, and my life seemed to be falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written half of the book. The bank manager was pressuring him, and he needed to know if continuing was worth it. He showed the draft to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more than that to pay off some debt and support his family. He had spent seven months on the book and needed at least two more. $30,000 was not enough, but he was advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say they had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next was remarkable. Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

The studios agreed to this amount, and they each presented their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four top filmmakers called, one after the other, to offer $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for ""The Horse Whisperer."" ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would be involved, but from a distance. The success of his novel also brought new support for ""Life and Limb,"" but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be wise to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for young people. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer has returned to chess to play against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, both simple and deep. However, as the following games have shown, this older, bearded player is not the same as he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. A new era of professionalism began because of Fischer's influence on the game. The focus on competition has become more important than the scientific and artistic aspects of chess. The main goal for modern players is to win. In international chess, a player's nerves and endurance are as important as their intelligence and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been high: a chess clock is used to make sure each player makes the required number of moves in the given time - failing to do so means losing the game immediately. Now, the playing sessions are longer, and many games are played without breaks. This increased pressure benefits younger players. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. It's notable that, among the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. It's not just the way the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess happens off the board - not just the psychological battles that Fischer is known for. Every professional must prepare seriously before a match, especially because computer databases have greatly impacted chess. A small portable computer can store one million chess games and provide instant access to hundreds of games of a potential opponent. In a recent match, each player had large teams of assistants working non-stop to find weaknesses in the other's strategy. The opening moves of a chess game are now analyzed in great detail. Being better prepared in the opening can decide the outcome of the game. Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours. For the chess master, this time is a constant battle. Losing focus can lead to disaster. So, the players are always under nervous tension. The chess clock adds to this tension. The end of the game often involves a frantic 'time scramble'. In these moments, each player has only seconds to make several moves or lose the game. With minds racing and hands moving quickly, the players make their moves and hit their clocks with coordination that any athlete would admire. These moments are not for calm thinkers. The game becomes a basic struggle where nerves, determination, and a strong will to win decide the winner. At the top level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress and tiredness. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready to compete again the next day. Most chess tournaments last for 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more demanding. The 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about two stone (10kg) in weight. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his departure from the chess world after 1972 even more puzzling. But in some ways, it was a fitting end to his story. It made Bobby Fischer a legend. If he has returned for the money, he stands to gain a lot. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will end up several million dollars richer. But if Fischer has come back truly believing he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the final result could be very disappointing.'"

""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" Interestingly, before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he admits. ""It's set in a car, which I wouldn't do now because of the challenges. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors.

Simon has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed me imitating him,"" Simon admits.

""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""Now I can choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was destined for success. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to pursue it because I was good at it and loved it."" Now, he is waiting for more recognition but is thoughtful about fame. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act.

Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving praise, moving into novels is a bold step. ""There's a structure in my poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad writing. My main goal is not to fall into a pattern of producing work without caring about its quality."""

She is 31 years old and is looking for Mr. Right, but she worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. Despite this, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'

B. This story is about the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing to take readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio.

C. In this story, it's normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. So, when professor Richard Vaisey falls for a Russian poetess, he talks to his wife's ex about it. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she also wants his help for her brother, who is in prison unfairly. The author skillfully untangles these issues with humor and insight, making the story enjoyable and witty.

D. This novel follows two pairs of best friends—two women and two men—who meet in 1960s London and stay connected for 25 years. At the start, one of them, James Hudson, an American businessman, is launching a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake as the editor. The launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story is full of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is excellent. It's a book where you can really get to know the characters and become absorbed in their lives.

E. Written by a top American fiction writer, this touching and funny story is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a past mistake and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is becoming an eccentric bachelor, surrounded by the chaos of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the tender relationship Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm and lovely book with a perfect mix of sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. Volunteers, especially those on gap years, may help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could hire more local workers than the volunteer's efforts alone. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is truly altruistic—focused on helping the visited community—or if it's more about gaining 'cultural capital' for personal career benefits. However, these projects might still help volunteers become more ethical and socially responsible in their future careers.

**B.** Volunteering can promote international understanding, improve conflict resolution skills, and encourage global participation through civic organizations. It can also create international social networks among ordinary people. Ideally, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by people from wealthier countries, it may mainly benefit these volunteers by giving them a broader perspective and career advantages, while doing little for communities without access to such opportunities. Volunteers might use these experiences to advance personally, rather than truly helping the host communities.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as imperialistic or self-serving, focusing on personal gain for wealthy Westerners. At its best, it benefits both volunteers and host organizations, allowing for an exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of life strategies aimed at helping others. These strategies, which focus on 'making a difference,' can seem positive in an anti-political climate. They avoid big government and business, but also bypass the democratic process, reducing development to individual charity acts. While volunteering is commendable, when marketed as sustainable development, it can degrade the true meaning of development. This approach shifts away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"Many of us use a radio to wake up in the morning, and a clock radio can help us get out of bed. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models.

One model advertised a 'dual alarm function,' but it doesn't let you snooze with a buzzer and then wake up later. Instead, it lets you set two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model is priced similarly to another we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a good deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We liked the radio quality, but it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone, and he always books a wake-up call just in case.

Another model was the most attractive and won overall. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock on his test model got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. However, the buttons felt like piano keys, which distracted me. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don't have to reset it if the plug is pulled out. We all liked this feature, but setting it up was complicated. Tom Granger found the model with a built-in lamp 'tacky.' The lamp was hard to use, and the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp only lights up the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but found the radio hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and annoying, but this model is the third most popular on the market.

A model aimed at young people with bright colors and a strap appealed to Tom Granger and me. It was easy to set up without reading the instructions, but the alarm could be off by 20 minutes. Paul Bridges found it 'fiddly' and 'useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was standard and took up little space. It had old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found intuitive. He admitted that button-tuning has improved radio quality, but we found the tuning crude. However, the radio quality was fine, and the buzzer worked well, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, making their spines stick out to protect them. This defense works well if the hedgehog has many spines. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have evolved to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the conditions are right, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in sports is challenging for anyone, but women often face additional hurdles. Training and competing require significant sacrifices, leaving little time for a normal life. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight a few remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land smoothly, but it can be frightening. Sometimes you feel unwell, or the weather is bad, but you just push through. It's hard to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You sacrifice a lot of your social life and friendships, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was surprising since I had never cycled before! I'm well-paid as a professional, and cycling offers many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling rather than making money. I train at least four hours daily on the bike, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitment—it would be impossible otherwise.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

""Rowing is tough for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most don't begin until they're 19 or 20, making it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches often stay for only a year, so there's no continuity, and the women's squad is disorganized. But it's great fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world—I didn't realize how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was very headstrong and disliked anyone controlling me. Now I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience I've had. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours daily with only three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, as my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as riskier.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

""Some men have big egos when driving—you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its downsides. At corners, men think, 'I've got to beat her,' so I've had many collisions! You need to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's tough to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the 1920s and were often seen as eccentric. It's great that more women are taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is striving for perfection—always trying to complete a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

""I get up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous anticipation before a race, and you really push yourself during it—you don't feel good if you don't. I've often asked myself why I do it. The answers are: a) I'm happier when I'm fit, b) I'm naturally lazy, and if I didn't push myself, I'd be even lazier, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the press, 90% of the article focuses on the men's event, with only 10% mentioning the women's event. The prize money isn't as good either. But we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso

Richard Cork shares his experience of meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was an 18-year-old student. While traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van, Richard ran out of money and took a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, he saw Picasso having lunch at a restaurant in the harbor. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him there with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard nervously approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and signed Richard's sketchbook. He even added a playful drawing on the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, with the help of an American woman who translated between them.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard began sketching Picasso, who made funny faces to make the task difficult. Despite the challenge, Richard continued drawing, feeling that Picasso was testing his determination. Eventually, Picasso relaxed, allowing Richard to capture his likeness.

Picasso appeared youthful and energetic, with intense eyes that seemed to look right through you. Even in a lively setting, he seemed deep in thought, letting his friends do most of the talking.

When Richard finished the portrait, Picasso wanted to see it. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and nodded approvingly. Then, Picasso took the crayon and quickly drew a playful version of Richard's face, adding his own artistic touch.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt incredibly lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention, which meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here, we explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Fresh Look**

Supermarkets know that customers love fresh products. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to give a fresh impression. Some stores even have bakeries that spread the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's colors, like green, can also make things seem fresher. However, most of what they sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't match this fresh image.

**B. Smart Product Placement**

Where products are placed in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use technology to find out which areas are most popular. They put high-profit items or fast-selling products in these spots. Items at eye level sell better, so manufacturers pay to have their products there. Special offers in ""dump bins"" attract bargain hunters. Stores also use ""complementation"" by placing related items, like salad dressings near salads, together.

**C. Spreading Essentials**

Supermarkets place basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more expensive items on their way. Similarly, chain stores put popular products far from the entrance, relying on customer loyalty to lead shoppers past other tempting items.

**D. Less is More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from stacking items high and selling them cheap. Instead, they display fewer items to make them seem exclusive. This approach is more about good store design than the uniqueness of the clothes.

**E. Total Temptation**

Food shoppers often focus on the total bill rather than individual prices. Supermarkets mix low-profit staples with high-profit items, so not everything is cheap. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as ""loss leaders."" More often, they buy in bulk to get discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The Price Tag Trick**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice prices more. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing also helps reduce theft, as staff must record the sale to give change.

**G. Effective Lighting**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully plan their lighting. Chain stores aim for natural light to show clothes' true colors. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look better.

**H. Guiding the Shopper**

Chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern marks the path through the store, and another marks sales areas. This ""Yellow Brick Road"" approach isn't always successful, as some shoppers stick to the path. Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths, leading to more inviting carpeted sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotions**

As you enter a supermarket, you might see large photos of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use ""video trolleys"" with screens that show ads as you shop. These trolleys target impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Mountaineer Chris Bonnington, who is 58, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written several books, like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-69, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in a new book called ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" I contacted Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail, where I could teach him some climbing skills, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while, then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we went to shore to practice climbing. The climb was challenging, and I was impressed by how calm Robin was in difficult situations. He moved quietly and steadily. At one point, we reached a big drop. I asked Robin if he had climbed before, and he hadn't, so I showed him how. Afterward, Robin politely asked if he could descend using the method he used on his boat, which involved using his arms. I wanted him to use his legs, but he managed to lower himself safely.

During our trip to Skye, Robin and I developed a strong friendship. His idea to combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural extension of our Skye adventure. Robin impressed me as a leader. Usually, the skipper makes all the decisions, but Robin always asked for everyone's input first. Even though most people were hesitant to advise him, it was nice to feel included in the decision-making process.

To be honest, I found the sailing part difficult and boring. The crises we faced on the way back were manageable because the adrenaline kicked in. What I struggled with was spending days in the middle of the sea. I'm more comfortable on land and not very handy. Robin, on the other hand, is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing things on the boat. I realized Robin didn't really need me, and sometimes I felt a bit useless, which was hard for me. The yacht was also cramped, with six people on a boat meant for four. At least on a mountain expedition, you can have some space from each other.

When we reached Greenland, it was my turn to lead the climbing part of the expedition. I found it challenging to be responsible for Robin's safety. There were times when, if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him, so I had to be very careful. I underestimated how tough climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the top, we were climbing for 24 hours straight. On the way down, we were so tired we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went through a lot but trusted me completely. He followed my lead, and when I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I knew Robin was also worried about the boat and whether it would be okay in the ice, but he still supported trying to climb the mountain again.

The only time we had a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We took turns keeping watch, and I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift. Robin decided not to wake me because he thought he could handle it himself. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep on watch. I felt like he didn't trust me, which made me feel insecure, so I told him. Robin quickly reassured me that I had misunderstood. While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't truly know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin is a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been with us since ancient times, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In Neolithic Britain, people spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes by Swiss and Italian lakes. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were quite different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced the dessert apple, Decio, possibly by the general Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties didn't suit the British climate, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apples, and many Western apples today come from these varieties.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and named for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking counterpart was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the late 1600s, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a street fruit and vegetable seller. However, prosperity declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This changed in the 16th century when Henry VIII sent his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern-style orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck brought them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the most famous apple-planter was John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. The Native Americans saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unusual clothing, and religious devotion inspired many folktales. He was said to be so kind to animals that he even slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a shoot growing from a dead tree's roots. It became an apple tree with a new type of apple, which Hiatt called 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, the apple was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous modern apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and rejected her parents' criminal life. She worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales, and was known as 'Granny Smith'. She managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity (1950)**

Today, apples are grown worldwide, from Himachal Pradesh in India to small luxury orchards in Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety and gene pool of apples. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now demanding more variety. We can't rely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity. We must value and protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

Ethnic Encounters

A highlight of our adventures is meeting ethnic or tribal peoples, like the Tuareg of the Sahara or the Maya of Mexico. We travel in small groups to promote understanding and minimize cultural and environmental impact.

Easy/Moderate Hiking

Many trips include easy walks through countryside or village-to-village hikes. These are found in places like Spain, Provence, Tuscany, Crete, Corsica, Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, and Venezuela. Main luggage is transported separately, so you only need a daypack.

Major Treks

We offer major treks for strong mountain walkers, sometimes at high altitudes. These treks take place in mountain ranges like the Atlas, Himalayas, and Andes. We use support vehicles or pack animals, so heavy gear is rarely carried.

Wilderness Experience

Exploring remote wilderness areas is a thrilling adventure. We visit places like the Amazon Rainforest and the Sahara Desert, offering a chance to experience exotic new horizons.

Sailtreks/Seatreks

These relaxing holidays involve chartering local boats, like felucca sailboats in Egypt or gulets in Turkey. We explore islands in Indonesia and the Galapagos by schooner or motor yacht.

Raft and River Journeys

River journeys range from a few hours to several days, using inflatables or whitewater rafts. No experience is needed, and safety skills are quickly learned. These trips offer unique insights into river environments in places like India, Africa, and the Amazon."
CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British long-distance runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located near Mount Kenya, a beautiful but remote area. For three years, Richard trained in Kenya's Central Highlands during the winter, but he had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground. On his fourth trip, he changed this by competing in a race in Kenya and staying at the national team training camp. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in a world championship race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. This was a great opportunity for him.

Training at high altitudes helps runners because it increases red blood cells, improving their ability to carry oxygen. This is one reason why Kenyan runners have been so successful. Richard's first race in Africa was also the first international cross-country race held on the continent. Although he finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, he felt he had performed well.

Richard believes that Kenyan success is not just due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to running. They run with ease, eat simple foods, and enjoy competing. The key to their success might be their training methods. During his stay at the training camp, Richard learned about their routine. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The facilities are basic, with athletes living six to a room in dormitories.

The athletes' day starts at six in the morning with a gentle run, followed by interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they only run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs, while lunch and dinner include ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers.

By the end of his stay, Richard appreciated Kenyan success even more. He realized that their success is not just due to genetics, upbringing, or altitude. The simple lifestyle, tough training, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard. The real issue is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers focus on mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become more fragmented. Major brand campaigns should focus on smaller, specific audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but only a few are advertised brands. Out of the 15,000 products available, you probably buy only a few hundred brands a year. For consumer durables, maybe a dozen a year. Cars? If you have a new one, it's likely provided by your employer, or you buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with all the products and services you purchase, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare this to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys about 400 of these, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4%. So, the idea that ""half of my advertising is wasted"" could be more like 96% wasted, but no one knows which part.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most, it's about 1 in 16 (6%), meaning the rest (94%) are wasted. You might think you're not influenced by advertising, but most people aren't. Waste is part of media advertising. It's unrealistic to think everyone will buy all the advertised brands. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the right audience, even if the advertiser doesn't know who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with the masses. But all waste is unpleasant. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns don't get a 100% response.

This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. With media, this isn't possible. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media; they could contact people directly. This applies to all types of ads, from personal announcements to soft drink commercials. An advertiser who gains one million new customers (2% of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2% of the population is very successful, but that's still a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Charles Clover explores Britain's most eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This town is known for two things: the ancient Southwell Minster, famous for its 'green' men carvings, and the 'autonomous house' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales' house uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into garden compost, and is heated by waste heat from appliances and the body heat of the family and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. 

The house looks traditional with its clay tile roof and blends in with the town's 19th-century architecture, even though it's in a conservation area. The doorbell is solar-powered, and the house is very quiet inside due to its super-insulated walls and triple-glazed windows filled with krypton gas. Inside, the house is peaceful, and Robert insists visitors take off their shoes. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very well sealed, even the cats have their own air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to environmental issues since the 1970s when they wrote a book called ""The Autonomous House."" They designed their home to produce no carbon dioxide and decided to live without mains water. They use composting toilets, collect rainwater in tanks, and use copper gutters to protect their drinking water, which is filtered twice. They avoid using a dishwasher to prevent using strong detergents. 

Robert explains that they wanted to show it's possible to design an environmentally friendly house without sacrificing comfort. The house's only medieval feature is its aesthetic: the hall, with a hearth and staircase, spans the building's full height. The Vales don't pay water bills, and last winter, they used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. Soon, they will install solar panels and equipment worth £20,000, which will reduce their electricity use even further. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will generate extra electricity, enough to charge an electric car in the future.

The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, which they rarely use. In winter, the house stays warm without it. Robert says that even at 18°C, the house feels comfortable because there are no draughts or heat loss. He suggests that people living in old houses should adapt to how people lived in the past, though this idea might not be popular. The house is low-tech, with most materials sourced from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making it affordable to build. However, commercial builders are not keen on adopting this approach."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a logical and scientific person. However, in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published the photos with an article he wrote, claiming fairies were supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges the idea that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and always could. Today, we are familiar with using computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the moment cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Blacksmiths

Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and those who work with it, blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the intricate ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architecture rarely used elegant wrought-iron features.

In the past 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in blacksmithing, thanks to a renewed interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Despite this, much of the work still looks old-fashioned, with manufacturers promoting 'classical' or 'Victorian-style' gates and balconies. Trendy design stores often feature rusty candlesticks with decorative bits. Fortunately, there are new options, and upcoming events aim to promote the blacksmith's craft. One such event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says we might be entering a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now. Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it with ease. Dawson says, 'These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.' The exhibition features about 250 pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90 and going much higher. Most of the money will go to the makers, but a portion will support the promotion of quality ironwork.

Dawson's own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow into shape when hot, like drawing with metal in space. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but becomes rigid and immovable when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans creates door-knockers and handles inspired by castles from horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. She loves that steel feels permanent and enduring.

Iron has given people visual pleasure and a sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"**THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING**

When I quit smoking, I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was really angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to a non-smoker in just four hours. It even surprised me. 

The session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened about two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to quit smoking, and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking campaigns, and I still am. I had low blood pressure, a healthy family, and I didn't feel sick. I even seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session in Birmingham called ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" to write an article about others trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't be trying to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, so I didn't expect their method to work on me. I enjoyed smoking; it gave me pleasure. The counselor seemed to understand something I didn't.

We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. The messages about quitting made sense to me. Just as smoking had been a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to seem appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I conquer the world too?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, which felt like hunger, faded after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I needed nicotine to meet deadlines, but I didn't fail to write a single story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was spending weekend mornings at home without smoking, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself.

Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is a challenge: eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, believes she should be a household name. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When Ferry started her research, she read scientific biographies and was surprised to find that even Linus Pauling, a famous chemist and Nobel Prize winner, did not have a biography available in her local bookshop. This reflects a broader issue: scientific biographies are often seen as uninteresting, even by scientists themselves. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that scientists' lives are usually dull to read about. This attitude contributes to the idea that there is a big gap between the arts and sciences, which is still common in the literary world.

However, this is changing. Scientists are now appearing more in public, not just in scientific interviews. For example, Richard Dawkins presents TV quiz prizes, and Steve Jones advertises cars. These appearances help people see scientists as real people, not just as distant figures.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be dry and focused only on work, ignoring personal lives. But books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" have shown that scientists can have interesting personal stories too. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are portrayed with their personal flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin was deeply committed to her scientific work. She solved the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which were major achievements. She won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964. Despite her demanding career, she was also devoted to her three children and managed a marriage with a frequently absent husband. Her ability to balance her personal and professional life is inspiring.

Understanding the passion behind scientific work is challenging for biographers because many readers lack the scientific background to grasp complex ideas. However, learning about science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort. It's unfortunate that many educated people are unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, while they would be embarrassed not to recognize famous literary or artistic figures."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability often called a 'sixth sense'. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, ask for her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers, but to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

This skill, known as dowsing, involves finding water, minerals, or lost objects underground. There are many ideas about how dowsing works. Some think it involves physical forces like magnetism, while others believe it is spiritual. A popular theory is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers, like Margaret, might be very good at sensing these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.

In recent years, droughts have kept the Wilkins busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of Margaret's clients are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other clients have remote cottages or barns turned into holiday homes, where running water pipes is too costly. Some are golf-course developers needing water for their clubhouses.

Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She avoids drilling where farm waste might contaminate the water. The water she finds flows through cracks in hard rock, which keeps it clean. However, in Cornwall, where they work, there is a lot of iron, so they have to be careful. They also need electricity to power the pump, so the well should be near existing power lines.

To find water on large areas like golf courses, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map, and it swings when there is water below. After identifying possible spots on the map, she walks the fields with her hazel stick. 'When I'm over water, I feel strange, like I'm reeling. Then I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the stick's forks in both hands and pulls them slightly outward. 'When water is directly below, the stick's straight part rises. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If you're off by even a little, you might miss the water completely.' Her husband also checks the area, and they usually agree on where to drill. If they don't, they keep searching until they do.

Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition in England. Many people, including anthropologists and writers, are interested in this mysterious ability. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This might be the best way to explain how she finds water so well. Without this 'sixth sense', how could her family continue their well-drilling business successfully year after year?"
CAE_36,"**We changed lives for a day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be exciting to try something different for a change. We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people, which was very different from her hometown. She had to learn quickly how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It seemed easy for the other waitresses, but Amanda struggled and ended up dropping the drinks. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed it off, saying everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, a line had formed outside, and Amanda felt nervous. She worried about remembering orders, but everything was automated, so that wasn't a problem. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she couldn't get used to the loud music. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised when a waitress said it had been a 'quiet' day. Amanda realized waitressing was more tiring than she thought. She had always believed it was a job for shy people, but it actually required being outgoing and calm under pressure. She didn't like the pay either and didn't receive any tips. Amanda was happy to return to her children, finding it easier than waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a 'mum' for the day. She had been warned that Amanda's daughters were cheeky, but she thought she could handle it. After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls. She dropped Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, thinking she would have some free time. However, Amanda left a note with chores like making beds, cleaning, and doing laundry. At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. When Sophie came home, the girls turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly. Cindy hoped they would tire themselves out, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. She didn't realize how tiring it was to look after two small children, with no time for herself and a huge sense of responsibility. Despite this, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, a 42-year-old dairy farmer, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher. On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was unsure about what to wear to school, as she couldn't show up in farm clothes. At assembly, she faced about 400 pupils and hoped she blended in. She helped with a maths class where children worked in groups, which was different from her school days. She also assisted with a nature project involving snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only had a few minutes to eat. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced on her, revealing her rusty French. Finally, they had Physical Education, and Rosemary was exhausted, but the children were full of energy. She found speaking in front of the class daunting. Despite teachers having more holidays, she preferred farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm had 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also made ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream to sell. Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and packaging ice-cream. It was hard to resist tasting the treats. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe, which could die if left for more than 12 hours. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two-and-a-half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children, as animals don't talk back. The hardest part was not being able to take time off, as the cows needed milking daily. Rosemary only gets about three days of holiday a year. Farming seemed romantic, but the reality was different, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without a musical background. Hakan Hardenberger, the only child of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a standout trumpet player by the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new compositions. When you meet him, he appears youthful and energetic, much like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature highlighted his work and growth, filmed in both the UK and Sweden.

Hardenberger was born near Malmo, and his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and Hakan played it constantly. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who quickly recognized Hakan's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher from the start. Nilsson was passionate about the trumpet and would connect with players worldwide, always searching for the perfect mouthpiece. However, Hardenberger notes that the trumpet is a simple instrument with unavoidable flaws, and no two mouthpieces are identical. He believes in understanding and working with these imperfections.

From a young age, Hardenberger had a unique sound, which he developed early on. Unlike John Wallace, a British trumpet virtuoso who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. Hardenberger collected Andre's records and looked up to him. His parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and risky, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special ability to connect with audiences. Thibaud encouraged him to enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger only prepared for the first round but advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and noticed that people listened to him despite his mistakes. Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but it's not. He avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. He thinks the power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**A.** The story of Tristan Smith takes place in the made-up country of Efica. It's a unique tale about human power, history, and humor. The author has skillfully created a world with its own history and traditions. The book is known for its humor and the author's special way of seeing things, combined with deep psychological insight. It's a challenging but rewarding read.

**B.** Harriet is a middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she wouldn't meet someone like Sheila, who is from a working-class background and takes care of her elderly father and grandson, Leo. Their lives change when Leo attacks Harriet's son, Joe. After the court case, neither boy talks about the incident. Leo, who was a good student and never fought before, won't say why he did it. Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him consumes her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author is great at showing how people deal with big changes in their lives and captures a mother's feeling that she can never do enough.

**C.** This book, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most remote Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. It connects this story with important moments in Scottish history, imagined through the daydreams of a young character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He disappears at one point but returns after World War II, having learned to value the simple lives of his ancestors.

**D.** After a recent successful book, the author has written a sequel with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life is a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, and Rosie helps her in her enjoyable manipulation of suitors and friends. By the end, Aurora must face the reality of aging and a new generation taking over. The author is good at revealing the sadness beneath the ordinary aspects of life and focuses on the unpredictable nature of events.

**E.** Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses impressive descriptive language to show each person's journey of self-discovery as they prepare to return home, their spirits renewed by life at sea. The author uses striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both challenging and enlightening."
CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical workday looks like.

**A. The Brain Surgeon**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34

**Anne's Day:**  
Anne wakes up at 6:30 am, goes to the gym at 7 am, and starts work by 8 am. She begins operating at 8:30 am on Mondays, Wednesdays, and some Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. Sometimes, she works for ten hours without a break. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. While she doesn't feel stressed during surgery, she often worries about the next day's tasks. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it's very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, she meets patients to explain surgeries, which she enjoys. However, time constraints can make it hard to comfort upset patients. Anne leaves work between 6 pm and 8 pm. She is on call some nights and weekends and always carries her pager. On holidays, she worries about her patients for the first few days and dreams about operating at night. She finds it hard to relax.

**B. The Senior Designer**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31

**Marita's Day:**  
Marita gets up at 7:45 am, leaves home by 8:20 am, and arrives at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, her team meets to discuss projects and any issues. Her team includes three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of her work is design; the rest is production. She receives a brief from the client and spends three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting her ideas to the client and getting approval, she manages budgets and hires photographers and illustrators. She coordinates with printers to ensure deadlines are met. Managing multiple projects can be stressful, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, often at a pub. If a client likes her designs, it's very satisfying, but it's disappointing if a project is rejected. She gets home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later, and finds it hard to unwind.

**C. The Chauffeur**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42

**Linda's Day:**  
Linda usually wakes up at 7 am, but on days she meets early flights, she gets up between 4:30 am and 5 am. Around 10:30 or 11 am, she might go for a bike ride or swim. Since her job involves a lot of sitting, she watches her diet and exercises regularly. She eats a big breakfast and snacks during the day. Clients often ask for recommendations on restaurants and shops, so she needs to know the area well. Most jobs are pre-booked, allowing her to plan routes. Not all passengers are polite, but most are well-behaved, and she has good relationships with regular clients. She works seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and tries to sleep by 11 pm.

**D. The Landscape Gardener**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27

**Tracy's Day:**  
Tracy gets up at 7 am, leaves by 7:30 am, and starts her first job. She and her assistant mainly maintain gardens they designed. They work mostly in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each. Around 11 am, they have a big breakfast at a cafe. In summer, she may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. Her business office is at home, where she checks messages and returns calls. She often meets clients in the evening to discuss garden designs. They use old materials to make gardens look aged, but sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren't appealing. It's satisfying to see a garden completed and blooming. Tracy finds it hard to relax in the evenings because she can hear the business phone. She sleeps well because the physical work is tiring. The job is tough but allows for creativity.

**E. The Civil Engineer**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27

**Zena's Day:**  
Zena arrives at the construction site by 8:30 am. As an assistant resident engineer, she oversees the building of bridges and a retaining wall. She ensures contractors follow schedules, safety rules, and minimize environmental impact. She coordinates site professionals and solves problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so she first checks in with the clerk of works to learn about any issues. Her day involves paperwork and answering design questions. Lunch is usually a quick half-hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm. When contractors are on break, she checks the site. Her role can cause conflicts, so she maintains open communication. She meets the duty resident engineer daily but acts immediately if urgent issues arise. Zena leaves the site around 6 pm and is always on call."
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I handle customer programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards program in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I manage advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I start work at 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes 10 to 20 demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because it's important work for the artists. I know instinctively if the sound fits our label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also oversee budgets and spending. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly work-related, and I often get home at 1:00 am, where I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques priced from £1,000 to £6,000, buying from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with a full-time restorer and liaise with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and the tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work set shifts, leaving home at 6:00 am for early shifts. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a half-hour break before returning to a different station. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we control aircraft movements together. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4:00 am. It's crucial to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if I'm unwell. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect me to gather many books based on reviews. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' representatives visit, and I discuss new titles for the coming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I quickly gather stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, then make any changes before they go live. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm. It's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**

A good leader is someone who inspires others and brings about change. They guide people forward. Leadership isn't about your background or how tall you are, as some early thinkers believed. It's not just about being smart either. Pat Dixon, who wrote ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is crucial, and to spread it, a leader should speak clearly and with confidence. Dixon says it's about having the courage to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Discovering Leadership Potential**

John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes many people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing, developing, and using these hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it might be harder to see it in our own workplaces. Yet, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

**C. Reflecting on Leadership Styles**

Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and kept information from you, blaming you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second just managed poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**

Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" says a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**

Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:

- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you're passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and take action.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you're usually a negotiator, try taking charge. Notice how this changes the outcome.
- Set goals and exceed them. Look at your job and identify where leadership can improve your effectiveness and career prospects.

**F. Developing Leadership**

- Leadership doesn't just happen. It develops from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.
- Don't assume your leadership style will immediately win over colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of Andrew Marton's version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal is interesting to compare with Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often closer to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his tough relationship with his sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's version has its highlights. The flashback scene, where the soldier dreams of his wife, is portrayed with a harshness that might be more effective than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer films. Fabrice Luchini plays a perfect villain, a sneaky politician causing chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short-lived. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for this type of film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
This is a visually beautiful but somber story set in early 20th-century Rotterdam. The detailed production and costume design make the film look like a museum exhibit. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless when evicting tenants. The tense relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on period details, missing the chance to fully explore the dark and intense narrative.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video release highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear and distinct. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings it back to life. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck boasts ""forty-eight international stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are as slow for the audience as for the characters. Logistically impressive, it is best suited for the big screen. On video, the experience is less impactful."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a gripping story. The narrator is a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement and follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets involved in political and church intrigues and a high-society murder. We always believe he will solve the case. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful.

**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. Kellermann's easy writing style and insight into human behavior make this mystery entertaining.

**BOOK F**

CAE_57,"At 34, Tim Pozzi decided to leave his stable job and go backpacking in Southeast Asia for a year. He reflects on why he and others his age are making such bold choices. Although he has traveled before, after university, he spent two years exploring North and South America. But life happened—he fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to a steady income. Over time, he realized he was sacrificing his personal happiness for his job. Quitting felt like taking control of his life again. 

Many of his friends are now married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with him, they do envy his freedom. Tim is single and has no strong career ambitions, so he feels he should make the most of his freedom. However, he is nervous about the practicalities, like renting out his flat and deciding where to travel. He is also worried about fitting in with younger backpackers and adjusting to a simpler lifestyle.

Tim is not alone in this feeling. More people in their late twenties and thirties are choosing to leave their established lives to travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people are realizing they can have adventures if they are brave and organized. For some, like Danny and his girlfriend Tammy, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. Others, like Matt, use travel as a way to transition from one phase of life to another.

The modern workforce is more flexible, with more short-term contracts, making it easier for people to take breaks. Some companies even support career breaks, knowing employees might return with new perspectives. Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, notes that many people are reassessing their lives and realizing that jobs are not permanent. Travel offers a chance to reflect and consider what they truly want.

Jennifer Cox argues that this trend is not about avoiding adulthood but about seeking a balanced life. Ben, a 32-year-old heading to Central America, sees it as running towards something he wants, not escaping. He does feel nervous about leaving his comfortable routine behind, but he is excited about the possibilities.

Tim shares these feelings but admits that a difficult boss pushed him to make this decision. Often, a significant life event, like a breakup or job loss, can be the catalyst for such a change. Despite his initial hesitation, Tim is now excited about the year ahead and feels proud to be taking this step. He believes many others in his situation feel the same way."
CAE_42,"Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her journalism career and felt disconnected from the technological changes. She shares how she turned her home into an efficient workspace. At 37, she realized she needed to revive her journalism career, which seemed outdated. Her resume was stuck in the 1980s, back when typewriters were the norm. She felt unqualified for jobs requiring desktop publishing skills, which she lacked. Even simple technology like pocket calculators confused her, and she couldn't use the video timer. She knew she had to act fast to save her career.

Then, she entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package for her family. They received a laptop for her husband and a personal computer for everyone. They quickly adapted to new terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing. The family started chatting online with people worldwide. The children stopped watching TV, and Georgina set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem for internet access. This setup allowed her to work from home and still take the kids to school. The children were already familiar with computers from school, but Georgina was hesitant, fearing she might lose her work by pressing the wrong button. However, she learned the basics and found it logical and easy.

Georgina started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month, and felt she had the best of both worlds. The computer helped her become organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets helped track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices saved time. For a journalist, being online meant she could research stories, ask for information, and discuss working from home with others worldwide.

However, working from home has downsides, like isolation and household distractions. There are also arguments over computer use when the children are home. Despite this, more people are buying multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and work. In her neighborhood, a new type of home-based work is emerging, avoiding the daily commute.

A report on PC usage in UK homes describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated, with most owning a personal computer and many having a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Georgina feels ahead of the curve and dreams of emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing her own magazine from home. The possibilities seem endless, with cyberspace as the limit."
CAE_59,"The Tartan Museum

The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh stands out with its modern, cheese-wedge shaped buildings and a large yellow sandstone tower. It contrasts with the historic surroundings of the city. When it first appeared, people had mixed reactions to its design, ranging from praise to criticism. Now, as the museum is about to open, the focus is on its exhibitions.

The museum aims to tell Scotland's story through various historic objects, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver. It provides a timeline to help visitors understand the displays without overwhelming them with national pride. The main question is whether the museum will be interesting enough for people to return.

Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He avoids using imaginative recreations of the past, believing that the public deserves the truth. Instead, the museum relies on explanation panels, captions, and some multimedia to tell the stories of the objects.

Inside, the museum features a series of interconnected galleries with pale, wood-paneled walls and deep display cases. Natural light streams in through narrow windows, creating a pleasant atmosphere for visitors to explore.

The museum also includes a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to input from a Junior Board of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland. Although the children wanted to ride through the displays, they got a hands-on center instead.

On the top floor, the Twentieth Century gallery is a temporary exhibition that will change every three years. It showcases objects chosen by Scottish people and other personalities that have impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Items include an electric guitar, televisions, and Thermos flasks. While the idea is entertaining, it might seem less serious until the computerised bank of personal stories is activated.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can vividly open windows to the past. The modern architecture of the museum works well from the inside, but its fit with the historic location is still debated."
CAE_54,"The end of print media might take longer than expected. The word ""transition"" suggests a smooth change from one state to another. However, the shift from print newspapers to online versions is not smooth or certain. Many believe that print newspapers will eventually disappear because their sales are dropping, while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen a decrease in print sales by 8% to 10% over the past year, but their online traffic is growing.

Despite this, the situation is not straightforward. The World Association of Newspapers reported a 1.1% increase in global newspaper circulation last year, mainly due to growth in Asia, even though sales in the West declined. News magazines, which are also expected to suffer in the digital age, actually saw a 5.4% increase. Similarly, while e-readers like Kindle are becoming more popular, the sales of physical books only dropped by 0.4%.

The idea that young people are abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. According to the National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe show different trends. For instance, the UK has seen a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, while Germany's decline is only 7%, and France's is 3.1%.

The assumption that online advertising would support digital newspapers is proving false, as digital ad revenues are decreasing. In response, 360 US newspapers have introduced paywalls. Interestingly, offering a combination of print and digital subscriptions seems to attract more paying readers. Print remains important for selling online subscriptions and generates significantly more advertising revenue than online ads.

Maintaining both print and online editions is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print still plays a crucial role in maintaining a newspaper's brand visibility, which is harder to achieve online."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well is challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.

**A. Grouping People**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or take the photo from a higher angle.

**B. Posing for Pictures**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff and awkward. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first, and might feel flattered. However, they may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away, making the interest lie elsewhere.

**D. Eye Contact**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don't have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny or unexpected to get a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something within the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the subject. A laughing child can make the viewer smile, while a sad expression can evoke sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. Situation Interest**

While close-up shots of faces are impactful, the background can add interest and information. When using a background, exclude irrelevant details or blur them. Ensure the subject isn't overshadowed by the background. A wide-angle lens can make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**

When people are interacting, there are great photo opportunities. Couples, mothers and babies, teachers and children, or teams working or playing sports make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a hand on the arm. Capture reactions with animated expressions or gestures.

**I. People and Places**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places they visit. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera, forming a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help. A good picture balances the subjects and the place, so both are equally interesting.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are just formal poses. Candid shots of events are more lively, and you're more likely to get natural photos when you know the subject well. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist who specializes in trompe-l'oeil, a style of painting that tricks the eye into seeing a three-dimensional scene. In this interview with Joanna Watt, Sarah shares her thoughts on her art and career.

Unlike many artists, Sarah doesn't sign her work unless asked. She believes the art itself is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and almost suggests that her paintings create themselves. This humility makes her a challenging interview subject. She admits, ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" and is uncomfortable being photographed.

However, once she relaxes, the interview becomes engaging and funny. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't fulfill her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart, who introduced her to trompe-l'oeil. This experience focused her interest, and she eventually started her own business.

Sarah's keen observation skills and attention to detail, developed through illustration, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil work. She believes that trompe-l'oeil can't be taught; it's about observing life. She insists she's still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well stop.""

Sarah is honest about her limitations, like her struggle to paint bread, which she says looks like ""grey concrete."" She also doubts her math skills, recalling a time she was overwhelmed by calculations for a chapel ceiling project. This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work as if someone else did it.

Despite her modesty, Sarah's work stands out. She has completed many significant projects for both companies and private clients. Her art often draws inspiration from architecture, like a dining room designed to look like a Venetian palace or a painting that creates the illusion of extra rooms.

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must first trick the viewer and then engage their imagination. She believes the art should be personal to the client, and she enjoys collaborating with them to develop ideas. Many clients become friends because she spends so much time with them during projects.

Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who give her creative freedom. They, in turn, are pleased with her work, keeping her busy despite her modesty. She repeats, ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" preferring her work to speak quietly. But her art is anything but boring, and it deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

**A** The way we are evaluated at work is changing. It's not just about how smart we are or our training, but also how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging people is important for deciding who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who might excel and who might not. These skills are crucial for future job opportunities. Unlike what we learned in school, doing well in exams doesn't matter much here. This new standard assumes we all have enough intelligence and technical skills. Instead, it focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are known as emotional intelligence.

**B** In today's world, job security is uncertain, and the idea of a 'job' is changing to 'portable skills'. Personal qualities are becoming more important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills' in the past, but now we understand them better as 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage our own and others' emotions, and using emotions to guide our actions. At work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Emotional intelligence isn't just about being nice. Sometimes it means being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. It also doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely. Instead, it involves managing emotions so they help people work well together towards a common goal.

**C** More businesses are realizing that emotional intelligence is important for management. The more complex the job, the more these skills matter. A lack of emotional intelligence can limit how well someone uses their technical skills or intelligence. While some people succeed despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more complex and team-oriented, companies that foster these skills have an advantage. In today's workplace, which values teamwork and customer focus, emotional intelligence is essential for success everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which doesn't change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people generally get better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others as they age. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn and improve these skills, which is important in a time when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence isn't a magic solution for struggling companies, but ignoring it can make everything else less effective."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often first appears on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Official guidelines say that images from social media can be used without permission only in special cases or if there is a strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, so UGC is clearly important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture's Origins and Uses**  
Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old, originating from traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat various conditions, but it is most recognized in the West for its role in pain relief. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly to help with pain.

**Understanding Acupuncture**  
Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that distribute Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is disrupted, it can lead to weakness or illness. During an acupuncture session, the practitioner identifies imbalances in Qi by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and observing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle habits. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin, sometimes using heat from herbs or applying pressure to stimulate Qi flow.

**Acupuncture Points**  
The points used in acupuncture are linked to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. Patients often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is manipulated, either by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. This sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over 300 main acupuncture points, with many more used less frequently.

**Scientific Explanations**  
Even without accepting traditional Chinese principles, Western doctors acknowledge that acupuncture can relieve pain. Scientific explanations suggest that acupuncture might work by stimulating nerves to block pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**  
Acupuncture is often a last resort for people with chronic pain. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-surgery pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some Western doctors of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to eliminate pain without the side effects of conventional anesthetics, allowing quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
Clinical trials for acupuncture are challenging to conduct, but those that exist show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists report similar success rates, acknowledging that it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, noticeable relief usually occurs after six or seven sessions, with some improvement after two or three visits.

**Different Approaches to Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering the whole person rather than just symptoms. They spend time diagnosing underlying weaknesses in Qi and consider external factors like weather conditions that might affect pain. This approach is different from that of most Western doctors.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**  
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional Chinese methods can deep, lasting changes be achieved. When choosing an acupuncturist, ensure they are qualified and willing to refer you to a medical doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer known for her complex and imaginative stories. Despite her calm and authoritative appearance, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is somewhat based on herself, imagining how she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, needing privacy to focus.

James is modest about her success, even though she is one of Britain's most famous crime writers, with millions of readers worldwide. She admires the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. Her reading preferences include books by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

James's success came later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford and raised in Cambridge, she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. Her life has had its challenges; her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters. Her husband's parents helped care for the children during these tough times.

While working full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office, she used her organizational skills effectively. Her work in forensic science exposed her to the realities of crime, but it was the structure of writing crime novels that attracted her. She wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to learn the craft without drawing directly from her own life experiences.

James believes that writing detective stories is about creating order from chaos. Solving a crime in a story shows the value of life, even if the life in question is not particularly likable. She emphasizes that nobody truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst

The study of handwriting, known as graphology, is becoming more popular as a way to understand a person's character. In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This sample can be as important as other factors in deciding if you are right for the job. Graphology is considered a real science in many places. Researchers claim it can help identify certain illnesses like heart disease and cancer, and it can show psychological states and emotional issues. More companies are using handwriting analysis for career guidance and during job interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of candidates for important positions. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the value of graphology.

Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over 20 years of experience, believes that doctors should take graphology more seriously. She argues that handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also assess mental ability and potential, whether someone should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character."" According to Ms. Marne, graphology is useful in identifying possible criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have stopped developing emotionally. This often appears in childish handwriting and in going over letters multiple times. I can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees.""

Ms. Marne explains that young male offenders often have very high ascenders in their writing, suggesting they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can detect if violence is likely, if the writer is under extreme pressure, or if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can even predict potential suicides. Heart and lung problems might also be visible, she says. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A major emotional upset can also temporarily change a signature, she adds.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. People whose letters form 'threads' instead of being clearly formed are said to be devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves. Light pressure indicates sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting, or how much it differs from standard script, shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures suggest inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a call for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science, and she thinks this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a person's entire history, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite these interesting claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists are very critical, saying that handwriting is simply a result of education, artistic ability, and the style of writing taught, and it has no other meaning."
CAE_41,"Is your office working well? Fresh air and comfortable chairs are important for a happy and healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their findings:

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple, with no central heating or mechanical ventilation. The windows open directly onto the street. Despite this, the small team seems happy. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to what they might do at home. This homely environment, free from strict rules, might be why they are content.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and often leads to bad posture. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff have varied tasks, like meeting clients and giving presentations, which helps prevent fatigue and boredom.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They find the office the right size—small enough to know what others are doing but big enough for personal work. The office feels both efficient and creative.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** The office is comfortable and well-maintained, with good air quality, helped by a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has already used an ergonomist. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal, with grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are bare except for planners and a maternity rights poster. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are okay. The office could improve by rearranging desks for better information sharing and displaying project successes.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** The office feels like a glass case, with a mix of smokers and non-smokers. Surprisingly, the air doesn't seem stale, even near smokers.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements, but this is by choice. Computer setups are outdated.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other and have good technology. The office is busy, but the wood paneling and brown carpet make it look dull.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many issues. The air-conditioning is poorly controlled, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered and dusty, with dust falling from the roof.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is more suited to a workshop. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially shorter people. Many chairs are old and lack adjustments.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning, especially with many smokers. Few conversations were happening; everyone seemed stressed by deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"Chewing Gum Culture

Chewing gum is popular and not limited to any social class. In the United States, people chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. This habit has turned into a big business. Each stick of gum has less than ten calories, but it is considered a food. This means it must meet the standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration. Most modern gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture.

In the past, things were different. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum there.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not worked. As the demand for gum increased, synthetic alternatives were developed. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances in nearly 100% humidity to collect sapodilla sap. They face many dangers, like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Despite these risks, chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which is then boiled into bricks at forest camps. Life at these camps is hard, with a basic diet of maize and local alcohol.

Even though their work is difficult, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. The U.S. used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle from Central America each year, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to cut costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are also finding new ways to market their products. They claim gum helps you relax, boosts energy, and reduces tension. During both world wars, soldiers were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms and causes decay. Saliva neutralizes this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow. Research is ongoing for new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. In the U.S., 137 square kilometers are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian cultural elements. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The facilities are simple, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favorite places. I discovered it by accident while climbing. After a long climb down from a glacier, I was surprised to find this hotel in such a beautiful, wild, and high location. It was amazing to arrive tired and find luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano.

This hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a perfect escape from Istanbul's noise. The islands are an hour away by boat and are idyllic, with no cars, only horse-drawn carriages, and beautiful 1920s wooden architecture. The Splendid Hotel is a landmark, painted white with red domes, resembling a hotel from the French Riviera. Though a bit worn, it retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the heart of Champagne, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with swans, the chateau was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. There are special weekend rates that include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel in Nairobi is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel without excessive luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers resting from one safari and planning the next. Some guests decide to stay longer after seeing the gardens, rooms, and dining options. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the city's busy center, and is a great place to watch the African sunset with a drink and a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guest book at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Liz Taylor, and Richard Burton. Today, you might meet a wealthy businessperson. This former monastery-turned-hotel is still splendid, with simple yet delicious food, fine Persian rugs, and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they meet certain standards. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. Right from the start, things didn't go well. The receptionist was busy on the phone and didn't notice Sue, which is a common mistake. Sue expected better because the Globe Hotel has three red stars, meaning it's one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.

The entrance to the hotel was also disappointing. It was through an unmanned door with a buzzer and a long, empty corridor. When they finally reached the reception, the receptionist couldn't find Sue's booking, even though most rooms were empty that night. The room they offered her was stuffy and had a hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

Sue has a reputation for being tough, but she insists she's fair. The next morning, after paying her bill, she revealed her identity to the hotel manager, Robin Greaves. He was worried, especially about a bad smell in the lounge. Sue suggested fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that room until it's sorted.

Not everything was bad. Sue praised Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a waitress, for their good work. The dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asked what they needed to do to get three rosettes, and Sue suggested not serving desserts that fall apart.

Sue's job is to point out problems that guests might not mention. Sometimes people complain about her feedback, but she has to be honest. She gives a verbal report and a written one because hotels pay to be in the guide. Despite the issues, Sue decided not to take away the Globe's red stars. However, another inspector will visit in two months to check if improvements have been made. Greaves said he looked forward to it, but he didn't seem very happy."
CAE_48,"**Seven Up: Conquering the Seven Summits**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. His journey began later in life, and he recounts his climbs in the order he completed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the summit when Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, likely due to lack of oxygen. Doug also found himself talking to his feet, worried about frostbite. Despite these challenges, Doug felt confident with Dougal by his side and managed to reach the summit by finding a better climbing rhythm.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Known as one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier in April 1976. They carried their gear and food on their backs, attempting a new route. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude. After a tough climb, they reached the summit and descended successfully.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite intended to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle, struggling to find water, but eventually found a trail. They attempted a challenging route but switched to the Umbwe route to reach the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, joined a group led by Phil Erscheler to climb Aconcagua via the Polish Glacier. Due to time constraints, they opted for the standard route. Despite strong winds, they reached the summit and returned to base camp, where Doug was encouraged to complete the Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh conditions, they reached the summit in 8 hours. The experience was exhilarating, though visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg. After acclimatizing, they used a cableway to reach 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. They faced strong winds and icy slopes but eventually reached the summit, only to discover another ridge to climb. They returned to the refuge as night fell.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and interact with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they proceeded with their climb. On May 12, they reached the summit, marking Doug's completion of the Seven Summits, celebrated with a standing ovation. Mission accomplished!"
FCE_15,"**Style Merchants**

Style affects every part of our lives today, from clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**

Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He suggests avoiding traditional, stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look, choosing simpler styles instead. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to cut and make clothes. You don't have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer something less daring, he offers a classic navy-blue summer suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes for much of the 20th century. Ingham's version looks fresh and modern.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

Sally Quail, who once worked for an art dealer, has no formal training in jewelry. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn't find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous actors and actresses seek out her work. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century jewelry. Recently, she started using diamonds. At 36, Quail says, ""I reached that point in every woman's life when she wants a diamond, so I began working with them.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**

Lily Grimson entered the competitive fashion world four years ago with only a basic art and design course. Two of her handbag designs have been chosen for a major exhibition. Her bags, whether made from fine calfskin or heavy silk, are always noticed. They are handmade in the UK and combine elegance with careful craftsmanship, making them special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of some of the world's most famous people. He says, ""Most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home."" His unique approach ensures clients don't look like they just left a salon. However, this relaxed style is expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain. She also provides floral ideas to top restaurants. Despite having no formal training in floristry, she left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her simple yet modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. Pratt advises keeping flower arrangements simple and strong, with few leaves. For wedding bouquets, she says the key is to use flowers of the same species."
FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The Merrion Hotel, a new five-star hotel in Dublin, has just opened. It took almost two years to transform four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the hotel to include the latest technology for both staff and guests.

Peter MacCann, the General Manager, wants his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. MacCann is confident that the system will be worth the investment over time. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can record any number of preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. The Merrion has a high-tech system to manage this. Guests can adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the standard 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can set each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C.

The technology in the rooms is especially appealing to business travelers, who are expected to make up 65% of the hotel's clientele. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables. Televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be easily updated, and DVD recorders can be upgraded as needed.

Despite all this technology, MacCann ensures that guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the Merrion must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He has a modern kitchen and better parking facilities, while the hotel offers a popular dining option without financial risk.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to succeed."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures, especially in the two long flower borders along the path. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and although Danny initially doubted some of her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another, building the painting over time. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the process of flowers decaying fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up when left in water, becoming more interesting over time.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then, thinking they looked artificial. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Today, her garden includes plants from distant lands, which feel at home there. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She now has an extra gardener but believes that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area were knocked down during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change upset many of the town's more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who leads the local police, would have been upset too. However, during the storm, Pelham was too sick to notice anything. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him too much, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forgetful and irritable, though he wouldn't admit it. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy to get his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't really understand it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics started working and his fever went down, that he got up and realized the walnut tree was gone. This made a big difference to how the living room looked. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The garden made it feel private. But now, the storm had changed things. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window on the opposite wall, but it created interesting light patterns that hid the worn-out furniture they brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room was very bright, and the shabby furniture was clearly visible. The view from the window was also unpleasant. The tall house next door, which the tree had hidden, was now visible, with its ugly purple bricks and outside pipes. It seemed to have many upstairs windows, all looking at the Pelhams' house. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said hoarsely to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"Living in the Valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed, but the branches stayed firm. Yet, we knew we had reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they didn't trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high up in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded the nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only occasional overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the large clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Mark Adams reflects on his decade-long career as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for this newspaper was his first serious job. Before that, he had done some reviews for novels, films, and radio. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, through radio and television work. Tom hired him, but he wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have been more selective with his team. Initially, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They planned to have weekly lunches to choose what to review, with guests to keep things friendly. It felt like a dream to Mark, being part of a new newspaper in a competitive market. He even doubted it was real, thinking maybe a millionaire was just pretending to employ him. The first time he saw someone reading his review on the London Underground, he felt awkward. 

Tom's idea for a team of critics didn't work out. It was a good plan, but they never met as intended, so they communicated by phone. The public preferred critics to focus on one area, so Mark chose film. Thanks to Tom's initial push, Mark now writes a detailed weekly piece, usually on one film. This suits him well, as he wouldn't enjoy the typical critic's job of reviewing every film. That would quickly bore him, making him dread watching films. The space he has allows him to expand his arguments or get creative during slow weeks. 

Mark wonders about his role in the public eye. He thinks people choose films based on stars, publicity, or directors, and rarely change their minds because of a review. So, if a review isn't a guide for consumers, what is it? He doesn't feel he needs to be 'right' about a movie or decide how many 'great' or 'bad' films there should be each year. His job is to present an argument, not to be a judge, and he prefers it that way."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because she thinks it's fun. A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner. Ideally, this person should be a sports enthusiast, preferably female, and interested in becoming an Olympic champion. The partner should enjoy long-distance running (regular 15 km sessions), swimming in cold rivers during winter, and cycling long distances (100 km rides). They must be able to do all three activities without resting.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It attracts large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes swimming 1500 meters, cycling 40 kilometers, and running 10 kilometers without stopping. It might be exciting to watch, but why do triathletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a talented 17-year-old with excellent grades choose this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases athletes use about personal satisfaction and mental challenges. She says, ""You swim 1500 meters, then get out of the water and jump on your bike while still wet. Of course, you get cold. After cycling 40 kilometers, you have to run 10 kilometers, which feels long when you're tired. But it's great fun and worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, although she was the only junior competing. Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Despite having the second-fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place well. She followed someone and ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. She cried during the run but didn't give up and is determined not to.

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. He says, ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard on the running machine that it threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, but unlike most people who stop when they can't go further, she kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior at this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running but slower in cycling. That's why she's working hard on it. She's trying to convince her parents, who are paying for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy her a £2,000 bike. This would help her compete in national 25 km and 100 km races.

However, her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I keep in touch with the other girls on the team by phone and letters."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our race times.""

Where will her focus lead her? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" which involves swimming 750 meters, cycling 20 kilometers, and running 5 kilometers. She wants to try even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's surprising, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"Amanda Roy discusses her love for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It's a world full of passion and excitement. But if you don't truly love an item, don't collect it. 

Since ancient times, people have felt the urge to collect. Early humans collected pebbles for their beauty and wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their shapes and colors. I've been a collector all my life, gathering everything from tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I went to a school in a remote, windy part of England. My parents would take me to a local museum filled with fascinating objects collected by others.

Many people share my interest in collecting. The reasons vary, but some find it gives them a sense of control. For me, it's simply enjoyable. A famous collector, the Duc de Berry in France, had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You don't need to be wealthy to collect. I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a bulb, only for it to be stolen later.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Sadly, this collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next day, I stood in the ruins, unsure if I was more upset about the furniture or the dolls. 

I'm fascinated by how collections change hands. A silver spoon once owned by a king or poet gains value. As items become popular among collectors, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable investments, especially if you kept the original boxes. Unfortunately, I threw mine away, along with the toys."
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work: Four People Talk About Their Jobs**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions at the Science Museum. My job includes planning, designing, and promoting these exhibitions. First, I learn about the exhibition topic and talk to experts to decide on the main themes and goals. I choose which objects and pictures to display. It's important that visitors understand the exhibition, so I plan interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure everything is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform the public.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents for students to learn the routes needed for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are learning how to plan the best routes, using the correct one-way streets and turns. I help when there's a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. As the test approaches, I challenge students by giving them a route and then telling them it's blocked, so they have to find another way. This helps them think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and mostly work from home. My job involves answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. Sometimes, I visit our main office, but I usually work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, and I run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better, which often changes their perspective. I love my job because conservation is my passion, but working for a charity means I always need more funding, which can be challenging.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is quite varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and manage the stock of about 300 books we publish. We maintain high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a passionate team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there's too much paperwork, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, the four of us spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have expanded it, but they've done it very tastefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. ""How about this?"" he asked one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it's quite a coincidence. ""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling as she welcomed us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" These are the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that, while her husband handles redecoration and repairs. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and then coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, this routine had developed. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experience as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year working there, where she cooks and cleans for visitors staying in chalets, which are typical wooden houses in the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a couple of years before starting a more permanent career. 'It's a great way to meet successful people,' she says.

Sarah doesn't live at the chalet. She starts her day at 7 a.m., walking about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing a full breakfast for the guests, including porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys being on the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

In the evening, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower but avoids napping, as it makes her too tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., with coffee by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and loads the dishwasher, preferring to leave the kitchen tidy for the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make the week enjoyable, but sometimes things don't go as well,' she notes.

Sarah meets her friends at her own chalet and they go out around 11 p.m., visiting places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. However, she doesn't stay out too late on Saturdays because Sunday is her busiest day. 'It's a tough day,' she says, 'and you don't want to cook breakfast with a headache.' On Sundays, she starts work earlier, serving breakfast by 7 a.m. for departing guests. Once they leave, she cleans the chalet thoroughly, stripping beds and getting everything ready. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests arriving around 4:30 p.m. She helps them with any questions and takes them to the ski shop if needed. After that, it's time for dinner again, and sometimes a drink, but often she's too tired and opts for an early night."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl, visited Seymour's factory one day. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was six years older. Rita was dressed in overalls and big shoes, with a bushy head of hair around her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago. Marie's class came from their rural school 50 kilometers away to see how gloves were made, especially Marie's favorite part, the laying-off table. This is where the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'.

Rita asked Seymour, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She kept taking notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, ""They come to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it into the right kind of leather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour offered, ""You should visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. They're primitive places. Technology has improved things, but it's not that different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is said to be the oldest industry, with remains found from 6,000 years ago in Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. It's an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for two days straight. That's typical: people in the glove trade love everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being manufactured, Miss Cohen?"" Rita replied, ""I can't say I have."" Seymour laughed when she said she had only seen her mother make a cake as a child. 

Rita's eagerness to learn reminded Seymour of his daughter Marie, who was much taller and fairer than Rita. Marie would come home from school full of what she'd learned, remembering everything and writing it down in her notebook. Seymour decided, ""I'll show you the whole process. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""
FCE_71,"Text: 'Is it really a dream job? Chris Arnot talks to four people with jobs that seem perfect to find out if they really are. A. Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. However, there's one small issue - she hates flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,' she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so cramped with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. Her tasks include organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. She met a pop group's manager by chance, which led to a job offer. She took secretarial classes in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy because he loves golf. But there were downsides. Caddies get a small fixed fee plus a percentage of the winnings. Average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first worked for golfer Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accounting skills were noticed by European Tour Productions, who made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies' scorecards. These results are used by TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is trying food at top restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave.' His cooking skills led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. At the time, Martin was a creative director at an advertising agency, and the column was a good extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a career.' He still cooks at home and tries to keep fit by cycling a few miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. 'Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I used to be a farmer and knew about the problem of foxes killing chickens. So I wrote a story with a twist called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing out the morning's notes - all with one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that's the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust, like golden mountains, reaching down to the blue lake. One afternoon, with nothing else to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof, landing on the sawdust and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too. They looked down, nervous and pale, but one by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one of them said, ""Let's go back up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went back up and started jumping off again, determined and a bit desperate, until only Michael was left on the roof. The others were below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the edge, licking his lips nervously, wondering why the jump seemed longer this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and jumping, but it didn't work. He tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. The others started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they began to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour as the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was silent; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little gray in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled sternness, but Michael, with his dark, unhappy face, barely heard her. He was still thinking about the grinning faces and the laughter from earlier."
FCE_44,"Careers Advice

Are you unhappy with your current job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change careers are turning to career advisers for guidance. The process usually involves writing a brief history of yourself and taking several tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help identify your strengths and suggest possible career paths, along with any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organization that provides career advice. Taking their test felt like being back in school, with a group of about ten people answering questions under time pressure. It was important to remember that the test wasn't about passing or failing. The psychometrics included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the test, I had a long conversation with an adviser who used the test results to create a report with observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, although I was surprised to learn I didn't do well in scientific, technical, and practical areas. It was comforting to know I made the right choice in pursuing journalism.

Changing your career doesn't always mean a complete change of direction. For example, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company after five years. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to step back and review my career,' says Donna. Some results were unexpected. 'I didn't realize I had a talent for design, but I had to consider the cost of retraining against my financial responsibilities,' she explains. Other options included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my existing skills and move into a field better suited to me than insurance. I'm now a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to several friends who are also happy with the service.'

Some people feel they wouldn't have made changes without help. Juliet Greene, 26, visited Career Counselling Services and made life-changing decisions. 'After six years at a major bank, I found my job boring and needed a new challenge. I didn't know what I wanted, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser, and the third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget what you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course this year. The advice was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.'

However, career advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I was at a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I hoped a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary cut or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that a friend could have given me similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"Title: A New Experience at the Dentist's

When you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch for patients. Jerome explains that many people only visit the dentist when they are in pain because they are scared. To change this, he has created a welcoming environment. He doesn't wear a white coat because it reminds people of pain. Jerome believes dental visits should be relaxing and even enjoyable.

This idea is surprising because most people think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome says that if patients are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their past bad experiences. One of his new techniques is using virtual-reality headsets. His practice was the first in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Jerome examines their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth, which most patients find interesting.

The dental office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like oranges. Jerome believes that smell is important because the typical dental smell can make people anxious. I found the pleasant smell in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but the quality of treatment is the top priority. For example, he uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but it is not painful if you are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. He discovered that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for dentists. He believes this patient-focused approach is the beginning of a change towards less formal dentistry in Britain.

As a patient arrives, Jerome offers him a cup of tea and asks what video he would like to watch. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The dental office feels more like a fancy beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a huge global business worth millions. During Easter, people in Britain spend over £230 million on chocolate, with eight percent of all chocolate sales happening at this time. Only at Christmas do people consume more chocolate. 

The large-scale production of chocolate began in the 19th century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a spelling mistake from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish preferred it with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the 19th century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to add some French charm. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular thanks to clever advertising linking it to the healthy qualities of English countryside milk. 

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain is about four bars per week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. The latest trend is the 'extended line,' where chocolate bars become ice creams, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to those tired of regular snacks.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices from the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. Perhaps you could think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke, at 83, has mastered the art of creating unique objects from shells. Although he is interested in trying new crafts like paper-making and feather-work, he is currently focused on his shell art, which he has been perfecting for the past ten years. As he shows me around his apartment, he worries about being boring, but his enthusiasm and the beauty of his work are captivating.

Cooke points out a pair of shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace. He mentions that he doesn't mind if they don't sell because he has grown fond of them. Initially, he didn't plan to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to hold an exhibition. This led to a successful show in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened, featuring 86 pieces with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Some pieces are priced as high as £2,000.

Cooke is open about the prices, explaining that his work is unique and that one day, when he stops creating, his pieces will become even more valuable. He wishes he had started this craft earlier in life, as he feels physically limited now compared to when he began. Despite this, his work is far superior to the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. He creates intricate designs, like boxes covered in tiny shells and realistic flower baskets.

Cooke has developed his own techniques, using materials he finds, such as cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases and a special glue from a sail-maker. He washes the shells with washing-up liquid. His creative process seems effortless, but the detailed and symmetrical results show great skill.

His search for beautiful, especially small, shells has taken him to beaches in France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. Cooke only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming the environment. He argues that many shells are destroyed by people walking on them or by the sea itself. He believes that collecting empty shells is harmless and that his art enhances their natural beauty."
FCE_62,"The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer isn't traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, she's probably studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

The receptionist at the agency told me, ""Kira will be a little late."" I said, ""Oh, fine, no problem."" I was trying to ignore the negative things I had read about models, like being difficult, vain, and unintelligent. Now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided going to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she came with her mother. Kira wasn't wearing expensive designer clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. She didn't seem selfish at all; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mom, very proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. Her older sister was the one who thought she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When she got the call saying she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she did great. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.

Kira now finds it challenging to balance her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, some unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This must be hard for Kira, as she seems very humble. But she says, ""They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even finish their school exams. As I finish the interview with the girl who seems to have it all, I ask what she would like to do if she didn't have the beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold of Canada to the warmth of Africa in search of valuable metals. Terence, an explorer, and his son Chris, a mineral expert, believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find a lot of gold; we just need to dig a few more meters to reach where it is concentrated.""

The Maddens have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing the land and finding small pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission to dig, taking earth samples, and cleaning up old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it seems unlikely, but we have some people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread, the idea of finding gold excited both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would bring more people here if they are right, but if they find gold, I hope millions don't come and damage the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, teaching and researching marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers deep into the ocean in a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is so tight that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they can't stand or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button, which releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested this yet, and it might not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle on a ship's deck with an instructor, who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, she has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers,"" another name for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius. The only time Rachel felt scared was during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest parts of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere under all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more stress. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign schedules, currencies, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in a train corridor, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your belongings in a backpack makes you have a very simple approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness, like burning socks that have become too smelly, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, where common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I didn't realize the possibilities of this type of train ticket at first, thinking it was just a cheap way to get to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always a little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organizing our own schedule, we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city you arrive in never actually existed until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you see it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Arriving at an airport in another country only to find out your baggage is missing is very frustrating. At best, you might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. At worst, you could be in a completely different climate, far from home, with clothes that are not suitable. Airlines don't often say how many bags they lose, but frequent travelers know that losing luggage happens sometimes. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will always be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Here's how the system works: Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can delay flights, which can cause problems with the baggage system. Human errors or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also happen. These issues are more common at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport managed over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline for the whole trip. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who specializes in kingfishers, which are beautiful blue-green birds that live near streams and rivers and eat fish. These birds are often seen in areas where old trees hang over the water, creating a mix of soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher moves quickly and directly through this scene, like a flash of light, leaving a lasting impression despite its small size.

Charlie developed a love for kingfishers when he was young. He finds it hard to explain exactly why he is so drawn to them, but they are indeed fascinating creatures. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher is linked to a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story suggests that the kingfisher's colors come from flying so high that its top side turned blue like the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. Scientifically, kingfishers don't have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the structure of their feathers reflects light in a way that makes them look blue or green, depending on the light.

Many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers because of their vibrant colors and the fact that, although they are shy, they can be observed from a hidden spot. Charlie's first attempt at watching kingfishers involved using an old blanket as a hideout. The bird came very close, but it took him four years to capture a good photograph. During this time, he became very focused on the European kingfisher, which is the only one of its kind that breeds in Europe. His dedication was noticed, and at 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant editor and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Charlie dreams of making the perfect kingfisher film, with no narration, just stunning images. He is drawn to the simple beauty of the bird, especially the colors of its wings. Even after spending so much time with kingfishers, they still fascinate him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but he knows that his connection with the kingfisher goes beyond what his work can show."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she asked to watch Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna and ended up filling in for an absent assistant. This led to more opportunities, including helping with another opera the next season. Manson, who is American, works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has worked with Abbado on several projects since her first experience. She says she was never nervous about conducting in front of an orchestra.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after failing in two others. He feels the timing was perfect, as earlier success might have led to his career fading away. The competition opened doors for him, including working as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being labeled as a ""competition conductor."" He hopes that in three years, his name won't be tied to the competition. Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra have invited him back, which is crucial for his career.

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods in opera. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. A turning point was taking lessons with Sian Edwards, who was similar in size to her, unlike her previous teachers. Kani appreciates the complexity of opera, including dealing with singers' personalities and the many arguments that arise.

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly fascinating. He started as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's ""Agrippina"" from the piano at a festival, which was easier than he expected. He knew the music well and aimed to achieve the performance he envisioned. His musical skills have earned him respect, and he is learning from all his experiences. Vignoles is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys most.

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
Wayne Marshall, now 32, was noticed by conductor Simon Rattle in 1986, which led to his first conducting job in London on short notice. It was challenging, especially dealing with musicians who were too relaxed. He was firm with them, always giving a clear beat to get the best results. Marshall believes many musicians don't need much guidance from a conductor, but he is not afraid to express his needs. Although he hasn't formally studied conducting, he is determined and knows what he likes. People have been supportive of him in his journey."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try out some of the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There’s a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park lacks a bit of atmosphere, and the scenery could be better. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and very focused on security.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He was thrilled with the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings at his height! The older kids enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is perfect, and the staff are very friendly. There’s something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we felt there was still a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you’ll get wet, but you don’t. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line isn’t too boring. It’s very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at one o’clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides aren’t too scary. I’m usually scared, but even I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes really fun. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but if you’re brave, it looked exciting. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park advertises that there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we felt that was true. Europe’s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a few of them but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome wasn’t always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"Running a business in the countryside: Five women share their experiences of starting a business in rural areas.

A. CHRISTINE HOGAN runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly income of over £200,000 and employs four full-time staff. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Having worked with computers before marriage, her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. She was careful with finances, always informing the bank manager if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, and local clients usually pick up their work.

B. MAGGY SASANOW designs greeting cards from home and enjoys being independent. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after marrying and moving to the countryside, she started her own business. She creates 50 different greeting cards, selling them to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. A downside of working from home is the constant household chores, like mowing the lawn. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. People send work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she finds more advantages than disadvantages in her work.

C. DELIA TURNER has a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started eight years ago when the business was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. She used to manage six full-time workers but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was hard because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and hires women who work from their homes. She must be ready to lower prices when needed and explore new opportunities.

D. TESSA STRICKLAND manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons, as London was expensive, and because she loves the countryside. She enjoys flexible working hours. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, requiring her to take calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to stop working. She publishes children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely as all her professional experience was in London.

E. MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly income of £250,000, employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, interested in health, making fruit cakes with quality ingredients. As demand grew from friends and relatives, she began sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, employing a baker, assistant, and professional cake decorator. She no longer cooks, focusing on the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as they started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is unique because not only are the sons talented musicians and composers, but their father, John, also makes musical instruments. When John and Hetty Watkins, both schoolteachers from South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son Paul, they found it too expensive to buy one. John decided to try making one himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello for Paul. Paul used this cello until recently, and John has since become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling a violin to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo was a highlight for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano but soon became interested in the cello. His parents initially wanted him to play the violin to join his father's chamber music group, but Paul was more inspired by the cellist in the group. He began taking cello lessons and excelled. Huw, on the other hand, was not interested in the violin but found his passion in piano and composing. He appreciated having Paul as a role model.

Paul achieved great success with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. He played his father's cello until he recently started using a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is over 300 years old, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul acknowledges that his father's cello will improve with age, but for now, the Rugeri has a better sound for large concert halls.

Paul will soon perform Elgar's Cello Concerto on television, but he won't be able to watch it because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. Their parents, John and Hetty, will have to manage their time carefully to follow both sons' musical careers in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside: THE NATIONAL TRUST**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills because they often work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders.

Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his family's farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden job on the Lleyn Peninsula, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the position, even though he didn't have formal training. He finds it helpful that he still farms with his parents, which allows him to understand farmers' issues and communicate with them effectively.

His farming background also helps him handle the physical tasks of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes now that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault, as they were following government advice.

When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. Now, they are communicating better and understanding each other's perspectives. Gareth believes they are close to working together effectively.

Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with managing public access to Trust land, planting and maintaining trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He ensures that tasks are completed efficiently and economically. Gareth enjoys seeing projects finished, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork.

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys interacting with the public, though he finds some people's attitudes frustrating. He dislikes when people act entitled to the land. Despite this, he loves his work and suggests that if you have common sense and enjoy outdoor jobs, you might consider becoming a warden. However, don't expect a job to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is leading the team as they prepare for next month's World Championships. Her days are busy: she teaches at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park. When asked if people stare, she says she's too focused on her training to notice much, though she might see cars slowing down.

Kendra is dedicated to being in top shape for the Championships. This will be her fourth time competing, and it's set to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. She feels excited about having home support, which she believes is important for improving netball's reputation in England. However, playing at home also means more pressure, as fans will expect a strong start.

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra notes that England has always beaten Barbados, but they are still a skilled team. England is currently ranked fourth in the world, and Kendra acknowledges that the Championships will be challenging. Unlike a series where you can lose a game and still win overall, the Championships offer only one chance to succeed.

Over her 15-year career, netball has become faster and more competitive. Players train hard to win, but Kendra says they become friendlier once the game ends. The sport now uses more scientific methods for fitness testing. Kendra believes it's crucial to think and train like world-class athletes. As captain, she aims to have a strong mindset and lead by example, supporting and encouraging her team.

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. While she may coach young players in the future, her focus is now on this final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might even shed a tear."
FCE_50,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS

How should you support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know the best way to nurture their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult to manage. While most schools can handle children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

In Britain, there are five specialist music schools, which are relatively new. These schools create a supportive environment for talented children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their skills with the help of professional musicians. Students at these schools spend a significant part of their day on music activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. However, students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school full-time, which means they spend their formative years with peers who have similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their main goal is to develop 'well-rounded and balanced individuals.'

There is a risk that separating musically gifted children from an early age can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and offer support when needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some are concerned about the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before considering a specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, such as a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers and opportunities for orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her house is surrounded by a large garden, which provides many of her painting subjects. The garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left behind plants that Susan liked, and she also inherited their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and although Danny sometimes doubted her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another, building the painting over time. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they decay fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up in water, becoming more interesting over time.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then, thinking they looked artificial. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Today, her garden includes plants from distant countries, but they thrive as if they belong there. Susan has a relaxed approach to gardening, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions, she has less time for gardening, so she hired an extra gardener. However, she believes that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"Title: Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is in her second year working as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. Known as Pilch, she works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors staying in chalets, which are typical wooden houses in the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She sees being a chalet girl not as a career but as a fun way to spend a couple of years before settling down. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah doesn't live at the chalet. She starts her day at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing a full breakfast for the guests, including porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys being on the slopes as much as possible. ""On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she avoids napping. ""It's fatal if you do,"" she explains. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., with coffee by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and loads the dishwasher. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she says. Sometimes she chats with the guests, while other times they prefer to be left alone. ""Good guests can make a week brilliant, but some weeks don't go quite as well,"" she notes.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps end the evening at Dick's T-Bar,"" she says. However, she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""A frightful day,"" she calls it, ""when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.""

On Sundays, work starts earlier, with breakfast for departing guests ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet thoroughly. ""We just blitz the place—clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready,"" she says. If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. ""Sometimes they are disoriented and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them,"" she says.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests needing boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it's time for dinner again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,"" she admits."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, because of my shifts, I don't see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint, but I was surprised that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it left me with a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different—people suddenly respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don't exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat super healthy, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It offers stunning views of the sea. No matter the weather or season, the scenery is always beautiful. From the other window, you can see some of the nicest gardens and homes in France, making you feel like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I had never been on a train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how wonderful it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unreliable—we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, hundreds of people rushed to get on, even climbing onto the roof for free. During the night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite train memories as children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important to me. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old, unused part of the line, maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I returned last year, it felt like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Are you trying to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, has the advice you need. Many readers ask us, ""I've written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" The first thing to know is that you need to research the market and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Selling your writing requires understanding the publishing world. No matter what you write, you need to know the market you are targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything you can find. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what publishers are looking for at any time. Keep updating your knowledge because new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go all the time. Publishers are always looking for new writers, so we must give them what they want. 

If you're unsure what to write, let's say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories, as it's a limited market now, and get recent copies. Learn what kind of stories they buy and who their readers are. Editors focus on meeting their readers' needs. Writers often ask me, ""My story has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone, but the work might not be ready for publishing. I try to give honest feedback with a positive outlook. Many new writers send their work too soon, before they are ready for the market. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. 

When you send your work for the first time, start writing more stories while waiting for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more. Each one will be better, and you'll start seeing yourself as a writer. Your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I also suggest not showing your work to others, especially early on. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible."
FCE_4,"On the last day of a difficult year, I was at the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. The station was busier than I expected, losing its usual clean and airy feel. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. A well-dressed, grey-haired man was going around asking people questions. He approached a woman sitting alone and then a girl near me with long blond hair. He asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She replied, ""I'm going north, but to New York."" He thanked her and moved on. 

I became curious about him. He asked an old lady, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Wilmington,"" and he moved on to another couple. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me, probably because I didn't look reliable to him. He seemed stressed and asked a woman reading a book, ""Please, tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She said she was, and he asked her for a favor. I pretended to check my watch, even though I didn't have one, and listened.

The man explained that his daughter was flying abroad from Philadelphia and had forgotten her passport. She called home from the station, unsure of what to do. He told her to stay there, and he would find someone to bring her passport. The woman asked why he didn't go himself. He said he couldn't leave his wife alone because she was in a wheelchair. This seemed like a weak excuse to me. 

I noticed he was holding a padded envelope, not a plain one, which seemed suspicious. It looked stapled shut, making me think it was hiding something. I silently warned the woman to be careful."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef.

I think everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was running a restaurant. When I found out about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was just what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory, and I felt very sad because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife focused on taking care of the children and did all my accounts, while I managed the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This has been very beneficial for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.

Gary was a very energetic child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into our corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs, and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had plenty of money at school. He was disciplined. He would wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, everyone helps out, and it was nice to see him involved. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was excellent in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as any of the adults working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He could make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he had a natural talent. So when he told me he needed to do work experience for school, I sent him to a friend's restaurant.

Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if his music career takes off. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do too many things at once, you might not succeed in any, so focus on what you know you can achieve. I told him, 'Gary, if you want to succeed in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it might be too late.'

Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a task meant to last all morning. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He had prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping others. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one will just give it to you. He's seen the opportunity he was given and took full advantage of it. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even ten percent of what you tell them, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was as difficult as finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often helped. But for Jo, who had just arrived in Dublin, there were no personal contacts to rely on. She had no one to inform her about available places. So, she stayed in a hostel and searched for a flat. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going; it was just assumed by everyone she knew from school that she would leave. Who would want to stay in a small, remote town? That's all she had heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates had moved to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle. But none from Jo's year were going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, which was run by nuns, so she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn't know they were all thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who seemed to have been rejected, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" ""Oh,"" said Jo and continued climbing. ""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" ""What did she do?"" asked Jo. ""Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Jo realized Pauline was a punk, which surprised her. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one before. ""I'm Jo, I work at the post office, and I called about the flat."" Nessa said they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs. One had ""Nessa,"" one had ""Pauline,"" and the other had ""Other"" written on it. ""We'll put your name on it if you stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them at seaside marinas, in movies, and on TV. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds explains how dolphin numbers are decreasing. Dolphins are special to us because they are very intelligent, understand human emotions, and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" have made us love them even more. But these shows don't show the real problems dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas today. 

For example, the number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine reserves, but this is not true. Without plans to protect them, dolphins might face one of the biggest wildlife crises of our time.

There are 40 different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two types usually live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups. We know little about them. The larger bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were once found along the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, like skin injuries.

Dolphins have complex habits, making it hard to pinpoint why their numbers are dropping. Overfishing, which is reducing fish stocks and threatening local fishing industries, also affects dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are overfished in one area, they might not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they can't see. Modern fishing methods use large nets that float or are dragged quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on beaches in France and Cornwall, showing marks and cuts from these nets.

Pollution is another problem. Waste and chemicals in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they accumulate in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk with high levels of pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's poisoned milk.

Perhaps the most debated threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their world. Noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better in water than in air, which might disturb dolphins in ways we don't fully understand yet."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but it's really beneficial for you. There are many reasons to exercise and not many reasons not to, for most people.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It increases muscle power and helps you stand or sit with good posture. Good posture is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. Exercise also prevents muscle imbalances that can cause injuries. It quickly improves areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It also makes your heart, lungs, and blood circulation better.

You might have heard these reasons many times and feel bored. But here's something interesting: exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems. It also helps control stress and can relieve some medical conditions. These reasons should convince you that exercise is good for you. If not, just think about it logically.

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, lifting weights, or using weight machines. Remember, don't train too hard or with too much weight, as it can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you're unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is important for improving your body shape. A stiff or sagging body doesn't look good, lacks energy, and can have minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling your head up. This helps lift your chest for better breathing and makes your body look slimmer. When standing with a balanced chest, you should be able to see your ankles.

Stretching your muscles improves flexibility and movement, helps maintain good posture, and prevents injuries. Stretching four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit. It should be a key part of your exercise routine, done slowly and carefully.

The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? It's their quest for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, finding producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman can be as challenging as spotting the wildlife they film. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, where six months of rain have caused unexpected problems. Newman mentioned they had to buy expensive equipment to rescue their vehicles from the mud. Their partnership has produced some of TV's best wildlife films, like their acclaimed film on leopards. Even while that film was airing, they were back in the wild, this time filming the elusive jackal.

This is common for TV partnerships. Film-makers have traveled the world to capture exotic wildlife since TV began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare visits to a safari lodge. He said they sometimes argue but resolve issues quickly. Neither sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they view animals similarly. They usually set up tents each night, but now they have a fixed camp. They prepare tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask. Their meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a challenge,' says Newman. It's a tough life, but being alone in remote areas lets them get close to the animals. Newman recalls filming a lion family where a lioness would greet their car as part of her routine.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on 'The Great Rift,' and two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. They spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I have a good working relationship because we share the same ideas and vision,' says Newman. 'We aim to create films rich in atmosphere that capture the true spirit of the place and animals, touching people's hearts. Evoking an emotional response is better than appealing only to the intellect.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis interviewed Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. When I met Kendra, she was having a typical day leading up to next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location. ""Don't people stare at you?"" I asked. ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,"" she replied. ""I might see cars slow down from the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

""My whole life is about being at my best for the Championships,"" Kendra says. She follows a strict schedule to reach peak fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they are expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure and expectations from the home crowd. People expect us to start strong.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But Kendra notes that the World Championships are challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games like in a series. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win overall. But in the Championships, there's only one chance, and you have to be ready.""

In her 15 years of playing at the top level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But once the final whistle blows, we become different people. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It's essential that we think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. As captain, she believes it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. She sees her role as supporting and encouraging her team.

""From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,"" she says. She decided some time ago that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, teaching and researching marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. When she's not teaching, she dives three kilometers deep into the ocean in a small steel vehicle to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very tight. Rachel can touch the two pilots sitting next to her. They can't stand up or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive lasts about 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.

If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, she has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site five days west of the Canary Islands. There, they explored a large area of underwater volcanoes, where the ocean seems alive. The Russian team was setting up equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When she's not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. Most of her salary comes from teaching, which she enjoys, but it allows her to continue her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes that release water looking like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and a temperature of 350 degrees.

Rachel recalls being scared once when diving with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the ocean's deepest parts is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out and sees the chimneys of the volcanoes, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body movements, how fast or slow we talk, and our voice's volume and tone, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to present yourself in the best way."" Many people ignore the importance of a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't even get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before applying again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from words, 38% from voice, and 55% from facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job immediately. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't turn him down. So, he offered me a lower salary than I hoped for. I'm sure I could have gotten more if I had controlled my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it will help in an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company's activities. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive impression and show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confused sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He spent 14 years in the business world, but over time, he found it less exciting and more of a routine. He didn't plan to leave for another five or ten years, but he was suddenly made redundant. Although the severance pay wasn't great, it was enough to start his farm. His big break came when he met the head chef of a local hotel with a top-rated restaurant. By supplying them, his reputation grew, and now he also sells meat through mail order. He's happy not to be in an office anymore, but he still works 80 to 90 hours a week and is still selling a product.

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. Painting started as a hobby, but he found it more exciting than his job. Taking redundancy and becoming an artist seemed like a logical choice. A career counsellor helped him, and Ron was probably the first person to say, ""I don't want to go back to where I've been."" Most people in their mid-forties need to return to work quickly for financial reasons, but Ron and his wife married young, and their children were independent. They moved to the north of England, leaving friends behind, but their friendships have survived, and many friends visit them now.

**The Hatmaker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own business making hats for private clients in her London flat. She enjoyed her job as a lawyer and earned a lot, but the hours were long. She didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more, so she left. Some people thought she would get bored, but that hasn't happened. The key is having deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and new trends, so she keeps a strict schedule. She's happier and less stressed now, though she misses socializing with colleagues. She loves being fully responsible for her work. If something goes wrong, it's her responsibility. When your name is on the product, you care more.

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. He liked the excitement but didn't find the work fulfilling. In 1989, he almost lost his job, but he resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what he wanted to do. Interested in health, he visited top gymnasiums and talked to their owners. He knew he needed qualifications to change careers, so he took massage courses. He was then offered part-time work at the Life Centre. He has no regrets and now feels in control of his life, which is the best part."
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I've always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. At 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because of the great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you have to avoid late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it's worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I make sure to celebrate, especially if there's prize money involved. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters often care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can't focus on the sport all the time—it's not healthy. I'm known in the sailing world, but I've only been recognized in public a few times, which is good because I don't want to be a celebrity. I get many letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's amazing to walk on court and feel the crowd's support. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. It has downsides, though. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport and be professional. It doesn't bother me much now. I'm focused on my game and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,"Shopping with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her kids want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty when she gives in to their demands. She also feels bad for saying no all the time and gets stressed even before leaving the house. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when faced with attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to make people want to buy products, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse is a major source of stress for parents. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and advertisements, which has helped reduce conflicts in the supermarket. Her son is now critical of ads, and they spend time looking at product labels together.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of two, says he refuses to buy sweets for his son because they're unhealthy, even though he buys treats like cream and chocolate for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent and says his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The Merrion Hotel, a new five-star hotel in Dublin, has just opened. It took almost two years to transform four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the hotel to include the latest technology for both staff and guests.

Peter MacCann, the General Manager, wants his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can record any number of preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. The Merrion has a high-tech system to manage this. Guests can adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can set each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C.

The technology in the rooms is especially appealing to business travelers, who are expected to make up 65% of the hotel's business. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology upgrades by installing extra cables. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be easily updated, and DVD recorders can be upgraded when needed.

Despite all this technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the Merrion must be excellent, as expected in luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a new, modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel benefits by offering a popular dining option without financial risks.

With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to succeed."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share their secrets.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I get my energy from excitement. I need to be doing something challenging. Learning new things gives me a lot of energy. Activities with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, also energize me. Dance is expressive and invigorating. I think boredom can make you feel tired and like life has no purpose. Being effective, even in small ways, gives you energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a burden. Enjoying what you do keeps you from feeling down, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep to feel great. When I only get six hours, I feel sluggish. Exercise gives me energy, but finding the energy to start is hard! I do yoga once a week and try to work out at home. Exercise lifts my spirits. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 PM, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily for energy; I think it's my natural enthusiasm and positivity. I dislike negative attitudes. I believe we should enjoy life and seize the moment. Enjoyment is key. You need to set goals and achieve them. My job is exciting, with lots of lively young people around. I love being busy and social. I enjoy taking photos and writing imaginary song lyrics for fun. It's a good mental release when I travel.""

**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and family life, and being positive helps. I love working with kids because they are resilient and give a lot. Energy is like a natural chemical that comes from interacting with others. Smiling at people and getting a smile back is thrilling. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise routine. My most energetic moments are playing with kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
""I love turning wasteland into a garden. I once transformed a concrete area by breaking it up and adding soil. It was better than any workout. Knowing someone wants to read my writing gives me energy. I find it hard to write without an audience. I also enjoy sneaking into private lands like a child, pretending I didn't know it was private.""

**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**  
""I believe in having interest and respect for what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do is exhausting. I used to be on committees and disliked the time they took. You have limited energy, so focus it on what's most important to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. People used these bone skates until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style to the sport, making it more popular. Today, modern skating combines art and athleticism, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is important for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees flexed to center your body weight, leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is key in skating, more so than in other sports. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot while making a small movement with the other foot. It's fairly simple, right? As you practice, you can gradually make your movements longer.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall, which helps reduce the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you feel confident moving on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn the basic moves, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch a good or professional skater, you'll notice how relaxed and smooth they are. To achieve this, you should regularly practice exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises are important, especially for the legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates a great program for overall health and fitness."

**A. Annika Reeder, 15,** won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard right now. I don't have time to watch TV, hang out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to focus on each day. When I'm extremely tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

**B. Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, and it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People often say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she's met people worldwide and gained confidence from her success.""

**C. Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they are happy when I win, but I do it for myself. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

**D. Sarah's mother** says, ""Sarah's passion for horses started when she was 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, you have to compete all over England. We save money by sleeping in the horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happiest on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is unbeatable.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10,** is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting a big head. I don't talk about my success at school because I don't like feeling embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game at 5. My father suggested it, and she loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to quit, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to discourage her because she's exceptional. If she has this gift, she should reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"Chris Greener was only fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, asking if he wanted to be the flagpole on a ship because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, Chris is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every ten years, people in Europe grow about one centimeter taller on average. More and more very tall people are being born each year. This doesn't mean we're becoming a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from when we were cavemen. We are now overcoming the effects of poor diets from the past, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says we are becoming like the Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago.

In the past, our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. Some tribes still live this way today. One study found that they ate 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming began, which changed everything. Farmers took over most green areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health and growth. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought to be a blessing, turned out to be a health disaster. Despite this, farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. 

Only recently have wealthier countries started to improve diets to match those of our ancestors. In the US, the average man is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it brings challenges. Beds have been the same length since 1860, and legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased. Clothing manufacturers also have to adjust their sizes.

The question is, how tall can we get? We can't grow forever. Robert Fogel from the University suggests we might reach an average height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists note that while individuals are getting taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we've become thinner and smaller, even with good nutrition. If the planet continues to heat up, we might shrink even more. So, global warming could counteract the growth in human height."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences: What It's Like to Be in One**

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the audience when a TV show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this experience. Studio audiences are a regular part of TV production, but they remain a mystery to many of us. When we see them getting excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are sometimes seen as the least prestigious of all live entertainment audiences. Some people in the TV industry even look down on them, treating them poorly. I used to think that studio audiences were just people looking for a brief moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life, including different social classes, jobs, and income levels. TV shows try to attract various types of people depending on the program.

For those of us who enjoy watching TV at home, it can be hard to understand why someone would want to be in a studio audience. Why go through the trouble of getting tickets, traveling, and sitting for hours in an uncomfortable studio when you can watch the same show at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on TV, even if just for a moment. I didn't believe this until I met Angela, who said she came for the chance to appear on TV. Another reason might be curiosity about how TV shows are made. But the most common reason I heard was simply that a friend gave them a ticket.

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. We imagine sitting tightly packed with strangers, following signs that tell us when to clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager mentioned that they hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.

Is there a difference between watching a show in a studio and watching it at home? For Claire, being in a studio is more exciting. Charlotte enjoyed feeling part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. Watching him live was different from seeing him on TV at home.""

From my seat, I couldn't see much of the live actors, just the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were filmed so far away that I ended up watching them on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people in the audience, it was just a fun and free night out."
FCE_9,"**Bruce**  
I prefer places where nature and people mix. When I travel, I like visiting charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. As a child, I went to school in England and would cycle to the village of Lastingham on weekends. Cycling was my escape from school, and I enjoyed exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt both familiar and new to me, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a diary, which was my first step into travel writing, a field where I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by hobbyists. I always choose first class because it's only a little more expensive. The scenery isn't dramatic, just fields, sheep, and a canal. But I love the part where the train goes through people's back gardens. For a moment, we can see people in their daily lives, like making tea or doing dishes. I see myself as a woman on a tiny train, looking into others' homes. The ordinary landscape makes me look closer and find something new.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coast. The beaches are hard to reach and rocky, so they aren't crowded. Some surfers come, but most people enjoy the sea's beauty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland through valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering places with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. Few people live or visit there, making it feel spacious and remote. I found it by accident as a student and have visited every year since, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these trips more special, though it saddens me that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon, England, at twelve. I used to cycle around the moors and villages. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house where you only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"Title: A Day of Animal Chaos

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work, excited because she found a pine snake. She asked if we could keep it, and I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank ready for temporary animal guests, and we liked to look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting for help. I rushed to their room and found our cat, Domino, with a white mouse in his mouth. The mouse was a Mother's Day gift for me. Domino was running around the room, trying to escape with his catch, while the kids were waving their arms to stop him. I joined the chaos and accidentally fell over. As I lay on the floor, I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank.

The room was a mess of jumping kids, a barking dog, and a hissing snake. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and returned to the chaos. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and saved the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived to old age.

Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I tried to handle the snake. It was not easy, but I sat on the floor and slowly calmed it down. Eventually, I lifted the snake and took it to the garden, hoping it would leave. When I let go of its head, the snake surprised me by wrapping around my shoulders like a scarf. My eldest child, DJ, explained that I was warm, and the garden shed was not.

We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it finally climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed up our feelings: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Send me a letter! In today's fast-paced world with phones, fax machines, and computers, the traditional art of writing letters is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is a unique experience that no other form of communication can match. There's the excitement when it arrives, the joy of seeing who it's from, and finally, the pleasure of reading it. Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote home once a week, and my mother did the same. Sometimes my father would write, and his long, funny letters were always a delight to receive. Most letters from home were about everyday events involving my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it's the letters I remember most. I also received letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I often dated people who had to work or study far away, so we stayed in touch through letters. Instead of hurting the relationships, writing letters seemed to make them stronger. I found it easier to express myself in writing than in speaking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! It's even more exciting when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There's also a lady from France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant on our way home from a holiday, my husband took her photo, and I asked for her address. If she hadn't replied, we would have missed out on a wonderful friendship. Now, we regularly write to each other. I can improve my French (she doesn't speak English); we've stayed at her home twice, and she's stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a correspondence could last so long. The local newspaper even reported it on the front page. I'm happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, arranged by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"Title: Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art

In the French Alps, at Mont Bego, there are tens of thousands of ancient rock carvings that are being slowly destroyed. These carvings, which are about 4,000 years old, include images of horned cows, fields, and various gods and goddesses. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings will be lost to future generations because they are being damaged so quickly.

The site, once a place for prayer and worship, is now a popular tourist destination. Unfortunately, the increase in visitors has led to the pictures being ruined by graffiti. Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, warns that if the damage continues, nothing will be left in 50 years. He has seen tourists walking on the drawings, which wears away the rock, and some even take pieces home as souvenirs. When visitors can't take clear photos, they rub the drawings to make them more visible, which damages them further. Some people even scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.

Experts disagree on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, suggests making the mountain a 'no-go' area, allowing access only through guided tours. He believes this is the only way to save the site and continue important research. However, Jean Clottes thinks this approach is too extreme and would upset local residents. He emphasizes the need to preserve the site, which is classified as a historic monument.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also opposes closing the site. He suggests allowing people to visit but acknowledges the difficulty in preventing damage due to the site's large size. He mentions the financial challenge of hiring enough guards and suggests that charging an entrance fee might be necessary, as government funding is unlikely.

Annie Echassoux, a researcher in Nice, is concerned that easier access to the mountain, such as vehicle hire, will lead to more damage. She believes the area should be roped off and guided tours provided. She insists that financial constraints should not stop the preservation efforts, as the site is a historic monument and must be protected for future generations."
FCE_32,"Shopping with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her kids want everything they see, like sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She can't afford all these things and feels guilty when she gives in to their demands, as she believes she's buying unhealthy items. However, she also feels bad for saying no all the time and gets stressed even before leaving the house. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and arguments about health don't seem convincing compared to the appealing ads they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so even without direct instructions, the ads still encourage children to want products.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse can be a major source of stress for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her children and has taught her son to be critical of ads. They now have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they're unhealthy, yet they buy treats like cream and chocolate for themselves. He finds it hard to be consistent, as his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers."
FCE_65,"Text: 'Climbing Walls: A New Era Once, climbers only went to mountains. Now, challenging climbs can happen anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The audience watches closely. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by just two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more known for the TV show Gladiators, but both the show and the climbing championships have one thing in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new and fast-developing technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were many good climbing spots. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. But as climbing became more popular, top climbers needed to stay fit. Since cliffs were unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom. Soon, many sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges to hold onto. Many of these early walls were inspired by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who, in the mid-1960s, built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University. Robinson had the idea of setting natural rock in concrete blocks, which could be part of a wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had design problems. These walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and angled rock slabs. Another problem was that once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers would get bored with the same holds. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a material that he shaped into forms like those found on cliffs. These could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a new challenge. French companies also started experimenting with panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable holds gave climbers endless new challenges.'"
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. And they are right; acting is a risky career. There are more people who want to be actors than there are acting jobs. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, while others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But choosing to be an actor is a personal decision, and only you can be responsible for achieving your dream. There are no easy paths to success in acting. There are no exams to pass, and even if you finish your training, there is no guarantee you will succeed. Success depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new talent, and acting can be exciting and glamorous, with the chance of big rewards. People often ask what talent is. I think talent is natural skill plus imagination, with imagination being the hardest to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what drives actors to perform. If you ask successful actors how they made it, they might just shrug. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they don't take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs like selling clothes or waitressing. Then, you might get an audition, but even if you want the job badly, you might not get it. So, actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and possible rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, from the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. It's partly up to you because if you don't care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_5,"Title: A Childhood Game Turns into a Business Success

Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, have turned a childhood game into a successful business. In their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, they often play pichenotte, a game their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought from Quebec, Canada. The family played it regularly, and it became a cherished tradition.

Years later, Dave noticed their old pichenotte board was worn out and decided to make a new one. This new board caught the attention of family and friends, who wanted their own. Curious about the game's appeal, the brothers took a board to a local sports bar. Initially, people were skeptical, but once they tried it, they couldn't stop playing.

Dave researched the game's history and found it likely originated in India as 'carroms,' which evolved into 'squails' in Britain. British immigrants brought it to Canada, where it became known as pichenotte in Quebec.

Pichenotte is a skill-based game for two to four players. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks,' which they flick across a board to score points. The goal is to flick pucks into a small hole for 20 points, with additional points for landing in concentric rings around the hole. The game is fast-paced, usually lasting about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity grow, the brothers started making more boards and selling them at markets and craft fairs. They even organized championships with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup.' As demand increased, they decided to focus on making pichenotte boards full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have produced over 450 boards so far. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and costs $595.

Although there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, the brothers are optimistic. They hope their business will continue to grow and eventually allow them to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Until then, they are happy to keep playing the game they love."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a piece of unused land, flat and covered with wild plants. For a long time, people thought it was worthless. However, with careful planning and hard work, one man, with the constant support of his wife, transformed this land into the beautiful place you see today. During the construction, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. Although machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of hard work was still needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.

In creating the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they needed to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds in this open area. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting from when the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics to withstand all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself. You will notice that a consistent scale is used, and even the smallest details are carefully included in the models. This was achieved through patience and unique construction techniques.

The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been applied in other model villages around England and are even taught in some college courses on modeling. All the model buildings in the village show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition to the village.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; a small mistake can lead to hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to see the models in action.

At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. New models are always being planned, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if there are any models you think do not meet the high standards of the rest of the village. We are always updating and replacing models, so your feedback is important. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about us."
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish photos that invade people's privacy and break the editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. Usually, these photos cause a lot of harm to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization set up to handle such issues. These photos rarely serve the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a photo of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where privacy is expected, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't take any action. It's shocking that the PCC didn't investigate on its own. They should also look into the recent scandalous story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star hasn't made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other shameful attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and on TV and radio. The public wouldn't support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it wouldn't be profitable to hide and take photos of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several issues. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it encourage the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the task is too big. How could the PCC realistically monitor all British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there's the embarrassment factor. No matter how seriously someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the further embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. They might have a worse story they managed to keep from the press, and they fear it could become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might seem like an enemy. A British comedian also suffered when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor when he and his family were photographed during a family holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the photos again with a new story about his 'anger', claiming it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It's hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"There is a lot of advice for college graduates starting their first job. In this article, we focus on moving to a second job. We are not talking about those looking for another temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those leaving a bad job within the first few weeks. Instead, we are discussing those who are taking a real step in their career, choosing a job that matches their ambitions after gaining some experience and skills. 

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to decide if you want to specialize in a specific area, move up to higher levels of responsibility, or switch to a different field. Whatever you choose, pick your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next one. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility.

If you feel like traveling, now is a good time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are ready to focus on your career.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a great first job because they were supportive. She learned about office work and improved her skills. However, there was no room for advancement. So, she quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years, I have become more capable, and my job has really grown,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to help me develop. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. I have moved from mainly typing and phone work to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. I also deal with various questions, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda involves me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,"Confident people: What's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were always this way, but many say it's a skill they learned because they needed to. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

A. Jenny: When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I surprised myself. Someone there suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

B. Michaela: Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive and impatient. I thought that's how confident people acted, but I learned that true confidence means believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with challenges, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I often talk to myself to overcome it.

C. Lisa: People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. In TV, looking confident is crucial. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and we feel better when talking to someone friendly. My mother once told me, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves."" This advice helps me. You gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.

D. Barbara: My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over time. By learning from mistakes, you become more confident. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You need to like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses that boost my self-esteem. They also encourage setting achievable goals. It's better to achieve small, tangible things than aim too high and get nothing.

E. Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and often disagreed in meetings but was too scared to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing down a few notes helped me feel more secure. Everyone feels a bit nervous speaking in public. The key to confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,"Paul Forster visits Malaysia for a kite-flying festival and experiences an adventurous night in the forest. Adnan Ali, a local, smiled as I returned his broken kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's a tradition here—if the line breaks, the finder keeps the kite. Plus, I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. Each kite was exactly 120cm wide and long, made from tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the trees near the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, watching Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A row of competitors stood ready, holding their kite lines, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites soared into the sky. Over 500 men and boys had entered the competition, which lasts five days each year. They submitted four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying ability. ""Flying kites isn't hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them requires real skill. Come to my home, and I'll show you how it's done."" I accepted his invitation, one of five I received that day.

At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night approached, he invited me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but my plans didn't allow it. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A narrow boat was there to ferry people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my attention. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km.""

I didn't realize that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the path, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay, trying not to worry about insects under my thin mattress. The night was pitch black, filled with various sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and countless creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained heavily. First came the wind, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. As I slid downhill, I wondered how the large butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being swept away, which sometimes happens, and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track.

In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people were curious and friendly, asking me questions like ""Where are you from?"" and ""How old are you?"" Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of its people."
FCE_48,"**What Kind of Shopper Are You?**

Everyone shops, whether they like it or not. But people shop in different ways. Do you know what type of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people about their shopping habits:

**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**  
I'm a shopping addict—I can't spend enough money! When I have cash, I'm out shopping, and it makes me happy. I find it hard to ignore sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple!

**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**  
I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he wants. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't often spend money on myself, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband the real amount—I always say I spent less because the real price sounds shocking.

**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**  
I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I shop, I know exactly what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and would rather be doing something else.

**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**  
I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and shop quickly. I do have some mistakes hidden in my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes makes wrong choices!

**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**  
I don't enjoy shopping at all. I dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and disorganized, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely need to shop for clothes because most of mine are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish quickly.

**F. Lisa, 22, actress**  
I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my girlfriends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it.

**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**  
I'm a careful shopper—I like shopping, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go overboard. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much!

**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**  
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it's too busy. I'm a careful shopper. I usually know what I want and never buy things immediately. I check other shops to find a better deal, which takes a long time!

**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
I'm an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city center, shops have lost their appeal for me. When I have to shop, I do it reluctantly. I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of effort shopping!"

**Easter Quiz for Children**  
During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about ""Surprises."" You can get the free quiz sheets at the Orange Street entrance. Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by Dutch 18th-century artist Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778 because the artist painted flowers in different seasons. Miss Violet Churchman donated it in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. You can see it in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. The exhibition also includes Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition is open until 31 May.

**Lecture News**  
A series of lectures related to the special exhibition happens every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will talk about Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will discuss Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will focus on Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists tell stories through their paintings.

Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to cook well. Bill, who is ten, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, but now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we've made together."" Flora, who is twelve, finds cutting onions difficult. She says, ""I love cooking. I once cooked a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we keep learning about food.

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

PET_27,"Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different types of grasses, and they can be found everywhere on Earth. Grasses are the only flowering plants that can survive in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way. Grass can quickly grow back after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, grass grows new leaves from below the ground, not from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live in one area because, after they eat the grass, it soon grows back, providing a fresh meal."

Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She needed to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends admired her creations and asked her to make clothes for them too. Kal found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes sold well, and nothing was returned. This success gave her the confidence to leave her advertising job, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. Her parents were supportive of her decision, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award.

PET_18,"Title: ""Little Cat, Little Cat, Where Have You Been?""

When Bo, the cat, decided to explore a furniture van, she ended up on a bigger adventure than she had planned. The van driver found her after he had driven over 500 kilometers. It was the end of a long day, and both the driver and Bo were hungry. He gave her some milk and started looking for her owner. He called his last customers, but none of them had lost a cat. Since it was late, he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he brought her to an animal hospital.

Meanwhile, Bo's owner was also trying to find her. After searching everywhere, he remembered the furniture van that had delivered something to a neighbor. Luckily, he recalled the company's name. He called their office, and soon Bo was safely returned to him."
PET_49,"Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin in northern Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm north coast through endless desert to the cooler Southern Ocean. It's often called the 'famous Ghan', but it's mostly known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan doesn't offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally meant to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. The Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south transcontinental railway. As I waited to board, everyone seemed excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners eager to get on. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan waited for four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't very interesting. It's mostly flat land with cattle. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train didn't meet all the promises of the advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is so far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time climbing Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is 600 meters high and is probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowl-shaped areas halfway up the mountain. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are necessary because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some of us were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety gear, like lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon became steep, and my legs felt tired. I was the least strong in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb in the future. After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and all the way to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, we weren't so lucky because a mist had come down. On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as challenging as climbing up. You need to be able to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to slopes that are too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns doing that job. That first time, I only felt I really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. But this new school is special because it's one of the first in our country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched the whole process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, although it meant losing some nice open space. The noise from the machines was very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think it would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are huge—much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town when they need it for meetings. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and big changing rooms that we can't wait to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you'll notice there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us—the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside, and it keeps the sound in too. So, when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is the tree on the school roof! The builders put it there because it's a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that you can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on our website.

Even though we're already using the new school, some parts are still being added. For example, we're putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We're so happy with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn much faster here!"

As I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would do. Half of us spent the morning caving, while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but felt happy and excited about what we had done.'"

After I explained, he kindly gave me money for the bus fare home. When I told the bus driver my story, he let me keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He told me they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. I got my handbag back with everything still inside.

PET_60,"Text: 'Sharks Sharks are some of the most feared animals in the ocean. They are excellent hunters because they have very good eyesight and can sense movement through special lines on their bodies. This makes them very dangerous to smaller sea animals, which they eat. While sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For instance, unlike most fish, sharks need to keep swimming to breathe and stay alive, so they rarely sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can stop moving entirely. This is helpful for researchers who need to study sharks, as it allows them to learn more about these interesting creatures.'"

PET_53,"Text: 'Joining the Kirov Ballet I'm Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov Ballet School in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around me, asking questions in Russian. I tried to speak a little Russian, and then they started speaking in English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I can understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad and even called home late at night once because I felt lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are very challenging, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This makes me confident that I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy. Right now, we are preparing for a new production, and there's also a competition for young dancers that I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"THE ICEHOTEL

For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people thought the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an art show in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, some foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the completion date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks. It's a good idea to wear shoes that are larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store for special deals, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). Normally, the store will be open from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for 24 hours straight on its first day. However, it had to close just 30 minutes after opening. A police officer at the scene said: 'We knew a big crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store filled up quickly, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. People outside got upset because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly. Another issue was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. Many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the store, which blocked the road completely.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got inside, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained the situation. They had no choice because it wasn't safe. I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

PET_34,"Tanya Streeter is a world record holder in free-diving, a sport where divers go deep underwater on a single breath. In 2003, she made history by diving 120 meters without any help, holding her breath for over three and a half minutes. This achievement made her the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. Despite concerns about the dangers of free-diving, Tanya believes that safety and training are crucial.

Most free-divers focus on specific events, but Tanya's training routine is consistent. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land, mainly in the gym, and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, preferring fast walking instead. When practicing dives, she usually travels and aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, resting between each dive to avoid fatigue.

Outside of training, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products and supports environmental causes through research and films. Growing up on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools, which she says is like living her childhood dreams. Known in some countries, she uses her fame to raise awareness about environmental issues. In her thirties now, Tanya plans to continue breaking her own records and has no intention of retiring from free-diving anytime soon, having started the sport at twenty-five."

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors came up with original new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was a success. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again."
PET_26,"Title: Caroline Benson's Journey to Her First TV Role

Caroline Benson, a new TV star, shares her experience of landing her first TV role. She never thought she would spend part of her first year at university filming ""The Finnegans."" Caroline had only acted in school plays before, but she loved the book since she was eleven. Her grandmother always said she was like Polly Finnegan, and Caroline dreamed of playing her.

Before starting university, Caroline took a year off to travel. While in Chile, her mother emailed her about plans to make the book into a TV drama. Caroline knew she had to try for the role. Her mother was surprised but sent Caroline's photo to the director and convinced him to meet her. Caroline flew back home and got the part.

Filming started a week after university began, so she got permission to be away for three weeks. When she returned, she woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on her essays. She didn't tell her university friends about the filming, but they found out and were excited for her. It was an incredible experience, and she feels very lucky.

Caroline wants to pursue acting as a career after university. Although her family isn't in the acting business, her grandfather was an opera singer. She has tried for other TV roles but hasn't received any offers yet. Despite her busy schedule, she managed to have a full social life. When filming ended, she wasn't sure what to do next. She has since acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, she hasn't been home much, and now that her first year at university is over, she's going to Greece for the summer with friends."

Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can have a positive impact. In both business and life, I need to have fun, feel a sense of family, and be excited by new challenges. I have always wanted the people who work at 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. This book shares my ideas with the world and makes them known. I like to think there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can achieve. I find that thought exciting, and I hope you do too."

PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than 300 types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweetener because sugar was very rare. Honey was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who even used it as money. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that it can help prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. But honey is not just food - it can also be used for sore throats and is an ingredient in many skin and hair-care products."

PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a desert city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival happened in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, there were only about a dozen hot-air balloons, and they took off from a parking lot in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at the current site outside the city.

What to See

The balloon pilots stay in radio contact and light up their balloons' burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can even take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies offering flights. Another option is to take a cable car ride from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere and offers a great view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

The Albuquerque Box

This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

Practical Advice

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long lines at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you are not using a digital camera, you will need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the connection between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid because of a large waterfall.

Isn't 500 pages of original writing of this quality, for just £6.99, quite impressive? Most of the book is fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable pieces by well-known writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the less famous writers seem to focus mainly on food. Be cautious with Jane Harris's Those Nails - it's best not to read it right after eating, as it has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset your stomach! The collection also features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are excerpts from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a bit of non-fiction, including a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers, and an extraordinary piece by Ursula Owen about herself.

PET_14,"The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when children are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to start teaching children at ages three and four, but she sometimes makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first students were her children's five-year-old school friends. 

Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, happening once every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents must also attend the classes because it is important for them to be actively involved in the lessons. 

From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between their ability to play and their ability to read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists. She often suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"Moonshine, the band, released their third CD last week called 'Here Again', which follows their previous album 'The Waves'. There have been some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance track, it's clear that the band is moving away from focusing only on slow songs. The second song is also a dance track and is even louder and more intense. Most of the later songs on the CD are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans, but they are excellent and could easily become hit singles. Singer Rob Letchford performs exceptionally well, hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded these songs before he had throat problems, which have caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets shouldn't worry, as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create great music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the upbeat ones that make you want to dance. However, I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks weren't as strong. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."
PET_36,"San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was discovered from the land, not from the sea. In 1849, thousands of people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But it wasn't the gold seekers who became rich. The wealthiest people made their money by owning banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

Pepys talks about important events of the time, like disease outbreaks, an enemy navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about himself, including his flaws - he often fell asleep in church or admired pretty girls. He describes his home life, such as arguments with his wife and how they made up, and his worries about her health. Besides books, he enjoyed music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and lots of fun. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles - he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also known for his work with the British Navy.'"
PET_33,"Text: 'The History of Shoes In the past, people didn't care much if shoes were comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins that people wrapped around their ankles when it was cold. We still use leather today, but other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on fashion trends. It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could fit either the left or right foot. All shoes used to be handmade, but now, even though some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are made by machines in big factories. The invention of sewing machines helped the shoe industry make lots of cheaper shoes for more people.'"
PET_20,"Text: 'No Title When I hurt my back, I had to stop my running career for a while. I wanted to help more women discover running, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to boost their confidence to start running. So, I decided to create a running club for women in my area. I was frustrated with many race organizers who complain about the low number of women in the sport but don't provide separate changing rooms for them. I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were of all ages and fitness levels. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they probably imagined it as hard and painful training. They didn't think about running while chatting and smiling in beautiful places, like along a river. At first, they could only run for a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to support women's running, and I've really enjoyed watching their progress—almost as much as they have.'"
PET_40,"The History of the Iditarod - The Last Great Race on Earth

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During the summer, boats could bring supplies to these towns, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making travel impossible. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to cross Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams for transport.

However, in 1925, the dogs were needed again when a disease called diphtheria broke out in Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, far across Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, the only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a dependable leader. The last part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had been driving dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to move forward, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

Despite the cold, 6,000 tourists visit every year to see one of Europe's most unique hotels. In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made entirely of ice. You can even have a wedding there if you wish. The bar is also made of ice, so it's not a good idea to put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are kept at around -4°C, but guests are given special sleeping bags to stay warm. If needed, suitable outdoor clothing is also available. The hotel is rebuilt every winter because it melts in the summer. Building the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow.'"

""At first, no one minded that I was a girl, but then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who had supported other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and found her playing football outside the club. He quickly noticed she was very fast. ""He talked to me about athletics, but I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was really hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose visited her parents and convinced them that Maria could succeed in athletics and help lift them out of poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an offer to train in the United States. She had refused before because she would miss her family. Her life was very different from the girls she met in the US. She says, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot."" Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year living happily in South Africa with her mother."

The view is amazing, and the Skywalk makes it even better. The Skywalk is 1,219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform with glass walls and a glass floor, allowing you to see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of people have visited it. You need to wear special shoe covers to protect the glass from scratches.

You start your journey in Vancouver, one of Canada's most beautiful big cities. This city is unique because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day on the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the journey is still an exciting adventure. You sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you pass through some of the most beautiful scenery during the night.'"

In the early zoos, animals were often trained to perform for visitors. This is no longer the case, as zoos now focus on letting people see animals in their natural behavior. Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with the idea of zoos. Supporters of zoos argue that they allow us to learn about nature and see wild animals up close, which would not be possible otherwise. On the other hand, critics say it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also point out that in poorly managed zoos, animals may live in dirty conditions and eat the wrong food.'"
PET_59,"**Jazz by Katie Atkins, Age 14**

I play the trumpet in my school's jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from other local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. The quality of playing was amazing, especially since everyone was so young. Musicians from each band even made up new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even more exciting when my band played!

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half do. However, anyone who is eager to play can join jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps across the country, and I've been to a couple where I learned a lot.

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for serious music students like me. I find jazz exciting because it's both new and old. You can create your own music, but you also feel connected to its history, playing on stage like the great jazz performers before you.

My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn't get far with our music!"

However, it doesn't rain often, and when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods, turning streets into rivers. Recently, many winters have been dry, so when it rains, the local people are happy. Marrakesh's parks and gardens don't rely on rain. Instead, they get water from a network of underground channels, built in the 11th century, that bring water from the mountains all year. Places like this, which are usually dry but get water this way, are called oases. If you travel further south from Marrakesh, you reach Skoura. Here, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas Mountains, covered in snow during winter, provide a beautiful backdrop.'"

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

**Flight Overview**

During the short Antarctic summer, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back in a Boeing 747. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica, and the rest of the time is for the return trip. During the flight, experts who have lived in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history and answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you the view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a window seat?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will switch seats. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, you can move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' so everyone can see the sights from both sides of the plane.

**What if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the satellite cloud images and chooses the route with the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife is at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica to protect the environment. To see wildlife, you would need to take a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can take photos. All cameras are welcome. We also offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we've made together."" Flora, who is twelve, finds cutting onions difficult. She says, ""I love cooking. I once cooked a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum then suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't interested at first. But now I'm really glad I joined."" Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen can get messy when they're cooking! As adults, we keep learning about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they're young, they'll know how to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"Winter Driving

Winter driving is dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly as you go over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road. 

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make your car hard to control. So, whenever you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it.

Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, triple the distance on snow, and even more on ice. 

Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid trouble."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law but ended up going to art school. He found traditional drawing classes hard but continued painting. In his late twenties, he received a scholarship from the Italian government to study art. This experience made him interested in early Italian artists, which influenced some of his work. He admired the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, but he admits he never knows exactly how the painting will turn out. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound simple, saying, 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors go well together.' Unlike some artists, he doesn't make sketches before starting a painting because he thinks he might lose interest and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why he prefers models who don't ask to see their portraits while he's working. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he hasn't felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He says he doesn't follow any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we didn't want to get it because of the noise. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. ""Okay,"" we said, ""but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our house with their guitars and other electric equipment. So, for several hours a week, our house is filled with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music sounds a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can't really judge their musical talent—after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did when I was a teenager—but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain—Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives students important life experiences outside the classroom, along with preparing them for exams. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They study in the mornings and spend the afternoons doing useful activities. These activities include helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is its diverse student body. Students come from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are PS20,000 for two years, many students need financial help. Scholarships are available, and a quarter of the students are British, with many receiving government support to attend.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education using methods that truly work."
PET_47,"Being an Older Student

At 32, I have just completed my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly and have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I was earning a decent salary, but I was bored because the job didn't challenge me mentally. I felt stuck and became more and more unhappy. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy, carefree, and hopeful. I wanted to be part of that world.

Now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. Despite these challenges, I am grateful for the chance to study. I know that having a qualification is important for getting a fulfilling job, which matters a lot to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. There are also typical student perks like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I sometimes worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in life has been a good decision."

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to warmer places because the winters in Canada are too cold for them to survive. Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents, and Bill thought, ""These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.""

Bill had a small airplane, and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese flew behind him. When autumn's cold weather came, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way there. Bill left the geese in Virginia and returned home.

This spring, Bill expected the birds to come back, but they didn't show up. So, he flew to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but couldn't locate them. When he got back home, he discovered the geese were already there, waiting for him. They had managed to find their way home without his help!"

However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She owns 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to keep them cool. 

Five years ago, Jenny decided to make sweaters from the wool and sell them at country markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people weren't interested in buying sweaters. So, she started making socks instead. The socks became very popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This marked the beginning of Jenny's business. Initially, she made the socks at home, but as her customer base grew to thousands, she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, the socks are produced by machines.

Jenny's socks come in six colors and five sizes, suitable for all ages. There are also different types of socks for walkers, sports enthusiasts, and skiers.

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave home and forget to close a door or window. He added that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home. However, winter afternoons are ideal for burglars because it is dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Many houses are empty during this time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to watch over each other's houses when people are away and to call the police if they notice anything unusual. 'We can also advise you on how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help is free.''"

Next week, I'm going to visit my sister in New York. I'll take many photos there as well. It's been a long time since I last saw her.

Thanks again.

Love,  
Roy"
KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before farming, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started growing their own food. These were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, and their villages gradually expanded. Some villagers could focus on other tasks, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was challenging during bad weather, leading to food shortages. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it is transported thousands of kilometers to reach our homes.'"
KET_22,"WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE

Nicola Peet finished school at eighteen, went to college, and then started working at a local airport. After nine months, she got a job with Saudi Arabian Airlines and later joined British Airways as a flight attendant. Four years after that, she became a manager, which is her current job. Here’s what she says about her work:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time flying. I train flight attendants and help them with any issues they have. I also attend many meetings. My usual working hours are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At the start of my day, I check flight schedules on my computer and then talk to some of the flight attendants. Occasionally, I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are doing. That's my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy the office work. Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, all I want to do is eat something and then go to bed! I don't make a lot of money, but I'm happy working for British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""
KET_39,"Dear Maria,

It's nice to be back in my home country, but I still think about all the friends I made in our English class, especially you. I cried when I left England because my visit was too short. I want to go back to England, but next time I will stay in a different city. I have started English classes again here. I learned a lot in England, but I know I need to study even more. How about you? Are you still looking for a job? I hope you find one soon.

Love,

KET_62,"People are interested in the weather for many reasons, and it is important for various jobs. For instance, the weather greatly affects farmers. In the past, farmers would spend a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Nowadays, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even check the weather on their mobile phones. Despite modern technology, many people still believe in traditional weather sayings. For example, they say that if the sky is red in the evening, the next day will be sunny. Some also believe that when cows lie down in the fields, it will rain soon."
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small town in Canada. They have been friends and classmates for a long time. Like their other friends, they usually enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have been spending their weekends in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because they have a lot of homework. Instead, they have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who has trouble with reading. Kevin finds it easier to learn words by seeing pictures and hearing information rather than just reading. Frazer wanted to help his brother, so he and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to create a computer game. Now, the game is ready to use. It is a speaking and picture game. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their computer game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in buying it."
KET_31,"Text: 'HOW DO THE IRISH POP-GROUP 'BOYZONE' LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE? Getting enough sleep is very important. When I visit my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, after a concert, it's hard for me to sleep because my mind is full of music. Exercise is also important. Before my car accident, I used to spend two and a half hours a day, five days a week, at the sports center. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups a day. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat well and drink a lot of water because it's healthy. I aim for about eight glasses a day, but I don't always manage that. It's important not to work all the time. I love my job, but I also enjoy other activities. In my free time, I listen to music or watch TV. It's beneficial to relax sometimes. I don't feel tired anymore since my doctor advised me to eat better. Now, I eat a lot of vegetables like carrots and spinach every day. But I still enjoy burgers occasionally!'"
KET_58,"Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films, which is more than any other country, including the USA. This makes it the largest film industry in the world. Watching films is the favorite pastime for most Indians, with ten million people going to the cinema daily. Bollywood films often feature romantic love stories, with singing and dancing as key elements. These films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling films internationally. Indian actors make more films each year than their Hollywood counterparts, but they earn less money. As a result, most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to produce, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is an exception; he is considered one of India's greatest actors and has starred in over 140 films during a career spanning almost 40 years."
KET_37,"I was born in the United States, but I have written several travel books about England. I lived in England with my wife and four children for 20 years. However, for the past three years, we have been living in the United States. Our children are now learning about life in the U.S. I believe they will be happier because they have experienced living in two countries. I like Britain and want to go back, but my daughter, Felicity, will start college here soon, so we will stay for another four years. I recently spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to discuss my new book. Many writers don't enjoy traveling around to promote their books, but I don't mind. I like visiting new places and meeting people. It's very different from my life in the U.S. when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars, and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was nice because I didn't have to pay any bills. Everyone was kind to me, and I had a lot of fun."
KET_2,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs: Miniature, Standard, and Giant. The Miniature and Standard Schnauzers came to England over 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer arrived more recently. The name ""Giant"" fits well because these dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs regular trimming. Most Miniature and Standard Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. Schnauzers originally come from Germany, where farmers use them to help with sheep. They are also used by the police because they are very intelligent. Schnauzers are great family pets. They are friendly and very good with young children."
KET_23,"Mary Daniels is a student in England. This summer, she had an exciting holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help build a road through a forest between two large towns. Mary said, ""It was very hard because there was no water to drink and no shops to buy food."" She also mentioned that it was very cold and wet in the mountains, as it is one of the wettest places in the world. Mary stayed in the mountains for six weeks. Although it was tough work, she says it was the best experience she has ever had. She hopes to go back next year to do more work there."
KET_60,"Dear Keira,

Thank you for your letter. Today was my first day at my new school. A girl named Nicole helped me find the classrooms. She is very nice, and I plan to visit her this weekend. My favorite class today was Maths, and I was pleased because I knew more than the other girls. I also tried playing hockey for the first time and really enjoyed it. Most of the teachers seem friendly, but I'm a bit scared of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot. I have to go now because I need to do my homework.

KET_1,"New Books This Month

The Long Night  
This is the first book by David Reilly. David started writing after teaching English for several years. The story is about Maha, a nurse in northern Australia. She works in a small hospital. One day, a baby is very sick, and Maha has to drive all night to take the baby to the nearest big city. They face many challenges on their journey.

Hard Work  
This is the twentieth book by Joanna Jones. The story is about Sombat, who works with his father as a carpenter in Thailand. They work long hours making tables and chairs, but they don't have much money. One day, a man dressed in black buys the most beautiful table in their shop.

Hospital or Cinema?  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. The story is about Tina, a young Brazilian woman who dreams of becoming a doctor. She goes to London to study English and medicine. One day, she meets a man who asks her to go to the USA with him to become a film star. What will Tina decide to do?"
KET_53,"Horse racing has been an important sport throughout history. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started when Arab horses came to Europe in the 12th century. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses. However, in the early 18th century, races became shorter and included several horses competing at once. Today, horse racing is very popular in the USA, second only to baseball, and is also enjoyed in many other countries."
KET_55,"Nick Barlow is a British actor who loves his job because it allows him to travel the world making TV shows. He feels welcomed everywhere he goes and enjoys remembering the amazing experiences from each country when he returns home. Although he has visited many places, Nick still dreams of traveling to South America and revisiting Australia. 

When Nick travels, he is accompanied by a team that handles the cameras and filming equipment. He packs lightly for himself, bringing only a few shirts and trousers, but he always includes some books in his suitcase. 

Nick's wife, Helen, is supportive of his travels. She has many friends and stays busy while he is away. She enjoys hearing his travel stories when he returns. However, there can be challenges. For example, when Nick was in the Malaysian rainforest, he learned that Helen was ill in the hospital. He felt awful because he couldn't be there to help, but she insisted he stay. He was relieved when he found out she had recovered."
KET_50,"Parrots

You might have seen these beautiful birds with their bright colors and long tails in the forest or at the zoo. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They usually live in large groups. Because they like to eat fruit, they can sometimes cause problems for farmers. There are many types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet, which they use for climbing and holding food. The largest parrots can live up to 80 years. They are very noisy, but they are smart birds and can easily be taught to talk. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"Howard Bonnier

Bray is a lovely village about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant there called The Palace about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier's name yet, but he is already quite famous in France. This is because he has written about almost all the best restaurants in France for French magazines. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend his money on clothes and CDs. Instead, he used it to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks—he says he has more than 250! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Was it easy to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant, and it's much harder to cook for fifty people than for your family, but he is sure he made the right choice."
KET_34,"John Pickering works in a park in a small town in central England, where he cuts the grass and waters the flowers. However, last week he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television. This is because John, who is 35 years old, is currently the most popular singer in Japan. A few months ago, he went to Japan to sing in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on the radio. Many young people called the radio station to request his songs again. In Japan, John uses the stage name Jon Otis. Despite his success, he plans to continue working in the park in England because he is unsure how much money he will make from his music. He says, ""I must keep my job in the park. I still have to pay my bills!"" The other gardeners do not know he is famous in Japan and have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This will not change the way we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"Line Dancing

In Britain, many people have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. You can find clubs and classes for line dancing in almost every town. According to Fiona Lever, a teacher, ""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" You don't need a partner because you dance in groups, which makes it a great way to meet new people. In Fiona's classes, both young and old people join in. Boys especially enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"Text: 'The Rhino There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open areas of Africa, while the others live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough and they have very little hair. A rhino's big body stands on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they eat only grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilos when it is born, after being inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and can live up to 50 years.'"
KET_4,"The History of the London Police

Today, you can see policemen everywhere, but back in 1700, London didn't have any policemen. At that time, a few old men would watch over the city streets at night, but they didn't earn much money. Around 300 years ago, London began to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people preferred to stay at home.

In 1750, Henry Fielding started paying a group of people to catch thieves. They were similar to policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown a lot and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was created with 3000 officers. Most of them walked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are paid quite well, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others."
KET_30,"Text: 'TO ALL STUDENTS: Are you interested in joining a camping trip this weekend? We will travel to the forest using the school bus and stay at a campsite from Friday to Sunday.

KET_7,"Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, thousands of people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to join the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are lively with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even watch artists painting on the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues like halls and cafes. Many tourists come to see new films and plays and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it's often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding a room can be hard, so consider booking your hotel now!"
KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive three hours north from Toronto, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and thousands of Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they fish for the fish swimming under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here every year for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then, you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet some nice people here!"""

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

One very popular tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. At this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures of people and opened a museum for them in Paris. Marie helped her uncle with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was put in prison. While there, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures and opened a museum. Her wax figures are still on display there today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were costly, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we see today. As bicycles became more affordable, many people started buying them. People began using bicycles to commute to work and for leisure activities. Nowadays, cars are more commonly used than bicycles because they are faster and protect you from the rain. However, some people still choose to cycle to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking spaces."
KET_63,"Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family for a beach holiday. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were most excited about the elephant show. We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their trainers and stood in front of big white cards. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started painting on its card. The trainers helped by giving them new brushes with paint and taking the old ones away. Slowly, the elephants painted pictures by following their trainers' instructions. I was amazed! One elephant painted a river, another painted a tree, and the third painted a bunch of flowers. When the trainers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest ones live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"Text: 'Big Cats There are many types of big cats, and they differ in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest of all cats. They can be as long as 3.7 meters from head to tail. Unlike most cats, tigers enjoy water and often cool off in pools when it's hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups called prides. In these groups, several lions work together to hunt for food. Lions usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and easily track other animals. All big cats need excellent eyesight to hunt smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

Ostriches have wings like all birds, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them change direction when running. Ostriches can run very fast, between 65 and 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the size of chickens and take about 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can survive for many days without water.'"
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson from Britain began snowboarding at the age of 20. Now, at 23, she has won many competitions in this sport. We talked to her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I've always enjoyed all kinds of sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It doesn't take long to learn, and you can become really good in just a few months."" 

We asked if she practices a lot. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because it's so beautiful. But free-riding, which is doing whatever you want when you're not competing, is the best thing in the world for me.""

We also asked what is important when learning to snowboard. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you spend a lot of time falling down!"""

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. People of all ages have climbed it, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different routes to reach the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It usually takes about five days to complete and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers manage to reach the top. This is often because the weather can change very quickly. At the start, it might be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"

Otters are excellent swimmers and can move through the water at speeds of over 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. Otters can close their ears and nose, allowing them to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very polluted, which caused many fish and insects to die, leaving otters with little to eat. However, today the rivers are clean again, providing plenty of food for otters.'"

KET_59,"People have always constructed buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We also use buildings like museums to store beautiful things. Many people work together to create a building. The architect plans how the building will look and draws designs to show their ideas. Engineers ensure the building will be strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it. The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a beautiful roof.

Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long-distance road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest that year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a bit and sometimes trains with Gail, but it's tough for Mike when Gail overtakes him, and he can't keep up. Gail trains diligently. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. However, she always takes a break from running on Sundays. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually about cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From ages twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. Ivan's mother started teaching him piano when he was six. By the age of ten, he wanted to write music and soon composed his first song.

Oleg Gagarin was the youngest of five children. His father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him traditional Russian music when Oleg was four. At six, he began lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning piano competitions. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

Josef Heptmann's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He performed his first concert at six. At ten, he played fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England. Josef always loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. Although he is very busy now, he hopes to write his own music someday."
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he started writing children's books at 60. Now, 13 years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he writes in his office and in the evening, his wife reads his work. ""She tells me if she doesn't like something,"" Bill says. His ten grandchildren, who live far away, also read his stories and give their opinions. This feedback helps Bill understand what young children enjoy reading.

Bill writes about life in his village and nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, ""The Sheepdog,"" which is about a farmer and his helpful dog. ""I have always liked animals,"" Bill says, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" Last year, ""The Sheepdog"" was turned into a film using real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film,"" he says."
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the 19th century. It featured a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards showed pictures of news events from that week, like an accident or a visit from an important person. People liked these because newspapers didn't have pictures at that time.'"
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur because they became extinct about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. The exact reason for their extinction is still unknown. Birds are considered the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs varied greatly in appearance. There were over 5000 different species. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and was a plant-eater. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as large, but it was more powerful. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast due to its long back legs.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can kill a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well and, like most animals, they use their noses to find food. There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in Southeast Asia. Not all black bears are actually black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which is from China. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard for them to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm areas of the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat anything they can catch, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat large animals or people. There are more than ten different types of crocodiles. All of them have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Most crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much bigger. Crocodiles can live for many years. The oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"Text: 'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers created the first hot air balloon that could carry people. Then, 120 years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers in the United States built the first airplane with an engine and flew it. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service using airplanes. Over the next thirty years, airplanes changed a lot. In the 1950s, they became much faster because of jet engines. In 1976, the Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world, flying at 2500 kilometers per hour, which makes the trip from London to New York only four hours long. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round and had no roof, so people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to watch plays by William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, talk to their friends, walk around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same area near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"
KET_48,"Dear Jeff,

I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week, we are staying in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water there is so warm, and I love swimming. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home!

See you at the end of September.

Sue"
