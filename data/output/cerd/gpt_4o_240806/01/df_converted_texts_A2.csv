CPE_15,"Title: Paying for Rubbish: Does It Work?

In many places, families do not pay directly for the rubbish they throw away. They pay through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a family that throws away a little. This can be a problem because the more rubbish there is, the more it costs to collect and dispose of it.

One idea is to charge families for each bag of rubbish they produce. This might make people throw away less and recycle more. In some American towns, people have to buy stickers for their rubbish bags. Only bags with stickers are collected.

In Charlottesville, Virginia, people started paying 80 cents for each bag in 1992. The number of bags went down by 37%, but people just put more rubbish in each bag. The weight of rubbish only went down by 14%. Some people even dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying.

Recycling did go up by 15%, but many people were already recycling before the charges started. In other studies, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduced rubbish by 0.3%.

Charging for rubbish might not be a bad idea, but it is not simple. Other things like income and education also affect how much rubbish people throw away. Richer towns throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, while charging for rubbish can help, it is not the only solution."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, and your relationships. This is important. No matter how good you are at your job, if it makes you boring or too busy to learn new things or be creative, then money and status won't make you happy. 

I am trying to find out how work can help us grow as people, not just be a way to make money. Work should help us discover new talents and meet different people. But this doesn't mean getting rid of unemployment is the only goal. As people get more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and make life better. Work should be like a piece of art, with a happy person at the center.

Even jobs like doctors, accountants, and architects are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are stressed, accountants worry about ethics, and architects can't always be creative. Middle managers are losing confidence. Companies are getting smaller, and new ideas like giving more decision power to employees haven't worked well. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match their company's values.

I am looking at different jobs to see how they affect people. I have studied what people can do in different cultures and how courage is made. I am now focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts work on making companies last longer and earn more money, but we also need to think about what kind of people we want to be and who we want to work with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us feel like we are stuck in our jobs, working not to become better people, but because we have no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. Many smart and lively people work in hotels for low pay and long hours. Hotels haven't changed much since the old days. They are not just places to sleep; they are like small United Nations where people from all over the world meet. Hotel staff are often from different countries and want to learn new things, but they don't really connect with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, helping guests meet new people. Hotel owners could use the skills of their staff better, instead of giving them only simple tasks. If they understood their staff's dreams, they could offer more services. But accountants often say hotels should focus on one main thing to make more money. It's time to think about work from a human angle, not just a financial one.

For me, work is about relationships. People want jobs that let them be independent and choose their colleagues and customers. This means they need to talk to people from different backgrounds. Communication is important, but real conversation is more than just talking. It's about understanding each other and creating respect. Every time you have a meaningful conversation, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents the hope of modern times. It is about growing and sharing information widely, like a good harvest. Broadcasting needs a central place to start from, like a bucket of seeds, to spread information.

When new technology allowed us to send words and pictures electronically, it was organized in a way that fit this farming idea. Even though television is similar to two-way communication tools like the telephone, it was always seen as a one-way, mass medium. This means sending information from one central place to many homes, which matched the way modern societies worked.

There were some experiments with different ways of using television. For example, in the 1930s, people in Britain tried using two-way television, like a video phone. Magazines showed how to build TV transmitters and receivers, and many people experimented with this. But big companies set standards that made it hard for these small experiments to continue.

In the early 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places, like theaters, in the USA and other countries. In Britain and Germany, people often watched TV in public settings. The idea of two-way or community television was not very successful, and TV became more about watching at home.

As people started to have more money and better living standards from the 1920s, they wanted homes with entertainment. This made it possible for many people in Western countries to have TVs at home. Broadcasting became a way for governments to share important information with everyone and create a sense of community.

Broadcasting was important for democracy because it helped people access information needed to participate in society. However, as technology changes, the idea of broadcasting might also change. The term might only describe a certain way of using technology during a specific time in history."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you have, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can get out of control. Modern ads are made to make us feel insecure. They tell us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much ads affect you, try not to look at any billboards next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads try to make us buy things in very convincing ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Scientists and researchers around the world have spent many years studying caves. They look at how caves are formed, how water moves in them, and the life inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and we want to learn more about them. Because of this, a lot of research has been done on caves. In some places, caves have been important to how people live. However, visiting caves can be difficult, so not only scientists study them. Many people who like to explore caves for fun also study them. This means there is a mix of professional and amateur cave studies.

**Weather Watch**  
A long time ago, people watched the weather using only their senses. This was the start of meteorology, the study of weather. Since the 17th century, it has become a very technical science. Now, satellites and electronic tools give us weather information quickly. Computers solve difficult math problems faster than humans can. Meteorology uses many long words that are hard to understand for most people. But simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience helps turn computer data into weather forecasts. People can still notice unusual things about the weather that help professionals understand it better."
CPE_16,"**Music and Theatre**

Not long ago, I thought opera was mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. In theatre, the words and the actors are the focus. The actors and the audience usually speak the same language. In music performances, like concerts or operas, many people, like me, might not know much about music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. Watching a great musician is like watching athletes; we see how much better they are than us.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They might not understand an actor's skill and often think they could do it too. They are not usually impressed by long speeches, though they often ask actors, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are less demanding. In fact, many people go to both theatre and music performances. In theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms.

Can music learn from theatre? I think so. Live music is full of emotion and can be very theatrical. But music performances often feel formal, with strict dress codes and a focus on conductors and soloists. This can make the difference between performers and listeners feel too big. Sometimes, audiences clap at the wrong times, which can interrupt the performance.

Many people are working to make music more accessible and to break down barriers. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from place to place in a cathedral and into the town. It was a great musical experience and changed the lives of many in the audience, who also took part in the performance.

I wish music had more of the risk and excitement that theatre can have. Sometimes, using unusual places for performances can surprise both performers and audiences. It might not be comfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists to different places. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, like concerts. But I believe music performances can change. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
I think sand is amazing because it can become useful things like glass and concrete. But I don't like sand when it is just sand. For me, it is a problem between the car park and the sea. Sand blows in your face, gets in your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a lot of water. But when you step on a towel, get in a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off you. For days, you find sand on the floor when you take off your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a long time. I don't like sand.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. Long ago, they used a beam to lock the door. Now, we have electronic locks with many combinations. But people still like using a key. Some companies tried using smart cards to open doors, but people prefer keys at home. One company made a new electronic lock but also included a real metal key because people like it.

**Modern Art**  
I was worried about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some things, like furry art, neon lights, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more, I would have more opinions. But art is not about understanding; it's about feeling. This idea is nice, but it doesn't work for me. The new gallery helps visitors understand art better. They have labels that explain the art and what it means. These labels helped me understand the art better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When books are made into movies, a lot of the story is cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see new things. When I worked on a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the talking and details from the book, but still keep the main idea. This doesn't mean the book's details were not needed. It's about how each type of story, book or movie, needs different things to help the audience understand. In books, we often see repeated details about characters or who is speaking, which helps us understand better. In plays, the talking is more like real life, sometimes with extra words that don't add much meaning, just to show people are talking.

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the movie world. It's like escaping from real life for a while. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, we return to the real world. Some people used to think movies were just for fun and not real art. They liked watching them but didn't think they were important.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many small rooms that looked the same. There were three main entrances, but only one led to where you wanted to go. It was confusing for new people, but the people who worked there knew their way. Together, they made movies that brought excitement and adventure to people.

**Film-makers**

Many people want to make movies. There are many books and courses on how to write scripts and make films. Some competitions give out cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his movie El Mariachi, which cost $7,000 and made him famous. He became successful very quickly. In the past, filmmakers took more time to learn their skills. They worked in different jobs like editing or writing before making their own movies. Now, without big studios to help, new filmmakers have to be more independent."
CPE_3,"In those days, many council houses were on the west side of the city. They were in rows and looked old and dirty, made of orange bricks or white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from a factory two miles away made the air smell bad, like sulphur. In the morning, you could see paperboys making faces because of the smell as they delivered newspapers.

I don't remember much from my early life. But I do remember sitting near a window and looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. I also remember faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling on a big mansion at Earlham.

My mother is in many of my early memories. She was small, precise, and often angry, but I never knew why. Even as a child, I noticed she was different. She was the most alone person I knew, even in a room full of people. She liked things to be proper, which was unusual in our area. She would clean a lot and tell me to 'behave properly'. This meant not going into neighbors' gardens, sitting quietly with hands folded, and listening to her favorite radio shows. There were many rules to follow.

My mother had some friends, even though she liked being alone. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn't talk much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They often talked about their problems, like bad legs and the cold weather. I felt like I was part of their complaints about ungrateful children.

Growing up in West Earlham was predictable. Until age five, I stayed at home. I remember playing on a rug while my mother sat in a chair. After turning five, I went to Avenue Road infants school. Some kids had mothers with bikes to take them, but my mother let other children take me.

I remember summer holidays when I saw the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about the Merchant Navy. Once, I went to a charity event where a woman gave out lemonade and talked about a junior charity called the League of Pity. My mother didn't like it and said they just wanted money.

My mother didn't trust politicians and thought they were greedy. She didn't have much kindness, but she cared about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum. We looked at paintings, and she even made a joke once about a Roman soldier painting, saying, ""I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"""
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air was thick and wet. It felt like I was walking quietly and secretly. I knew this side of the street very well. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards. There was Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of the Kring and Potts families, where my first friends, all girls, lived. I didn't know everyone by name, but each house was special to me. I remembered the little paths in the cement that took rain from the roofs to the street. I used to skate or ride my scooter over them. As the street went downhill, the houses got smaller, and the front yards were tiny. Over the years, things changed: wooden porches were replaced with iron ones. Some houses became stores, and some stores became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert is a furniture designer. He lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. The flat has big brick walls and huge doors. Rick didn't want an open space because it was hard to relax or work when everything was in one big room. So, he used a big plastic sheet to make a hallway and hide the office. This way, the kitchen is in the middle, and he can use it for cooking or making coffee. To make the flat feel warm, he used light wood for the floors and added furniture from his parents or markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" came out in 1977. It was a travel book that changed how people wrote about travel. The book was exciting and full of imagination. Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make the stories better. He believed that through travel, you could find amazing stories from the past.

**Swimming**

One summer, it was raining hard, and I ran to the pool behind my house. I swam in the rain, watching each raindrop hit the water. The rain got heavier, and it felt like the pool was rising to meet the sky. In the summer of 1996, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in a pool. Walking, cycling, and swimming help us feel free and explore places that are still wild and mysterious. A swimming journey would let me see parts of the world that are still full of mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose in evolution. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children become close. Many people think children cry because they feel helpless. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than what it shows. In early human groups, crying might have helped people trust each other and feel connected. Tears can also happen for other reasons. We might cry to show we care about people who suffer. Sometimes, we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially when we are with others. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it change our lives? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but we are not sure about what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will probably change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the air is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are important.

The problem is knowing how the world will change and what is causing these changes. In the last 100 years, human actions have increased some gases in the air, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate now and will continue to do so. We know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years, showing they are related. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C in the last century. Most scientists think this is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. These programs use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, and other climate factors. However, they are not perfect and are expensive to use. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know the climate system is complex. Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before.

GCMs suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. The sea level will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Scientists also expect more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts. These changes will affect the environment and humans. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are, the species they have, and their benefits to humans. This includes food, water, and where people live. Some effects might be bad, but not all. Some changes could be good. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have helped wheat grow better since 1952.

However, many future effects of climate warming are not good. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry areas. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where less rain has been seen in some parts. Rainfall is happening more in autumn and winter, and less in spring. Another problem is changes to ice. This will affect glaciers, sea ice, and wildlife. The Arctic ice might melt completely, which could help marine transport but also increase iceberg dangers.

The most visible effect of global warming might be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds more water to the oceans. Many people live near coasts, so rising sea levels could cause serious problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face flooding. Many people could lose their homes and become environmental refugees. Small island countries could disappear if the worst happens, which would be devastating for their people and culture."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong and healthy, both physically and emotionally. This is the type of people needed for the first trip to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans work out. He wants to send a capsule on 5 January 2018. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. Saving fuel is important because the next chance to go to Mars after 2018 is in 2031. It is a big challenge, but people are working hard to create new technology. If they succeed, the spacecraft might make it. Even if it doesn't, the work will help future space missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the way we think about art makes it hard to understand. Art is often seen as just a building, book, painting, or statue, separate from our experiences. But real art is about what it does to us when we experience it. Some art is so admired that it becomes hard to see it in new ways. When art becomes ""classic,"" it can feel separate from the people and times that created it and from how it affects us today.

Art can seem like it's in a special world, away from other human activities. People who study art need to connect art with everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our experiences. To understand art, we might need to look away from it for a while and think about everyday experiences that we don't usually see as art.

We can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants, but to understand them, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. The same goes for art. We should start with simple experiences that catch our attention and make us happy.

Today, many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comics without thinking of them as art. When art is only in museums, people find joy in everyday things around them. Some people think art is separate from daily life, but the best times for art are when it is connected to what we do every day."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often think of lions as amazing hunters. They imagine lions working together like a team to catch their food. In the evening, lions quietly move and surround their prey. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, which is to get their next meal. But after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. We started our research in 1978 to find out why lions hunt together, take care of their cubs, and scare away other animals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its young survive, then working together might not always be good. If an animal is too kind, others might take advantage of it. So, why do lions work together? We thought we would find the answer in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. It took us many different research methods to learn about their behavior. Wild lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now starting to understand them.

**Pop Music Review**

Bedrock's third album was very important for the band. The album, called ""New Life,"" changed rock music in the country for the next ten years. The old style of serious music with loud guitars was replaced by a lighter, more fun style. The album mixed social topics with fun sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. It had humor and irony, and the singers did not hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting different styles and writing songs. They sang about things like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. The album's real strength was in its deep, sad songs like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" ""New Life"" had 16 great songs with no bad ones, which is rare for long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I loved stories about ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from ancient times. My mother told me a story about one Sibyl. She offered nine books to the King of Rome for 300 gold pieces. He said no, so she burned three books and offered the rest for the same price. He refused again, and she burned three more. He finally bought the last three for 300 gold pieces. I learned a lesson from this story about sales and life. I was often a lonely child. When I asked to play with other kids, they sometimes said no. My mother told me to do something so fun that other kids would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I got the chance to write a travel book, I wanted to find something interesting to me. I don't like traveling much, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to go. I like to visit ruins because I enjoy thinking about the past.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you send your manuscript to a publisher, it usually goes into a big pile called the ""slush pile."" A junior editor or an experienced person who works part-time will look at it. They want to find something new and exciting. If they like your novel, they will give it to a senior editor. Then, it will be discussed in a meeting. The editor must explain why your novel is good and if it can sell well. They also want to know if you, as an author, can be successful in the long term. Publishers often want to meet new authors before making a deal."
CPE_39,"**Advertising Challenges in the Early 1990s**

If you worked in advertising in the early 1990s, it was a tough time. The economy was bad, and the recession was worse than expected. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were high, people spent less money, many lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. Every business was affected, especially car and building companies, which lost 30% of their business. Many people and companies in different countries suffered.

Advertising people were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They had to help companies make money with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money. At the same time, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on making products that customers wanted, not just what was easy to make. This change made marketing more respected but also more challenging.

Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, and a lot of money was spent on advertising. But in the 1990s, the advertising industry faced its worst time in many years. The bad economy made companies look closely at how much they spent on advertising. They wanted to know if it was worth the money. Many companies were not sure what they were getting back from their advertising spending.

Advertising was under more scrutiny than ever. Companies wanted better strategies, creativity, and media placement. They wanted the best people working hard for them. This meant advertising people had to do more with less, just like their clients.

Other challenges made advertising difficult. The recession made people worry about costs and taking risks. There were also changes in the population, more power for retailers, changing consumer needs, more sponsorships, stricter advertising laws, and the challenge of advertising in other countries.

These issues made companies think about how to make advertising work better. But finding help was hard. Companies and advertising agencies were busy dealing with these problems and did not share their secrets. Conferences and seminars gave some help, but books on advertising were not very useful. They often made advertising seem better than it was, which did not help people responsible for advertising in companies."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job. Being a chef is hard work: long hours, lots of pressure, and not much money. But I didn't care. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life was not fun. Being a chef seemed like a good change. It felt more real and honest than my life at college. I also loved the idea of cooking. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I remember the starter very well. After eating, I wanted to thank the chef. I felt happy for days. After that, I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started to prepare for a career in cooking. My history degree felt unimportant. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making big meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming teacher was a small, strong man with tattoos. He used to be a drill sergeant. I asked him to teach me how to dive. He told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this for an hour. Next time, he had me stand and dive from the edge. He was very strict. Every time I came up from the water, he told me what I did wrong: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes!' The next week, I went to the high diving board. It looked very high. I was scared but tried to be brave. I moved my arms like he taught me, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, my dive was not good. The instructor was not happy, but I felt great. I thought, 'This is what it means to be free like a bird.'

**The Traveller**

For people who like a comfortable bed and running water, travelers seem strange. These are people who like the unknown. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone in small boats, and eat insects if needed. They live with the unknown every day. It is easy to think of them as odd, like hermits or writers. They live in a world different from ours. We can ignore them and go back to our safe lives with microwaves and phones, happy that our risks are small, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time on it. He is not the best sailor, but he is good. He sails because he likes to write about it. Sailing gives him stories to tell. His boat has a device that shows his exact location. He likes this device, but he thinks other sea tools are not good. He believes the compass changed how people connect with the sea. Before the compass, sailors watched the waves and felt the sea. Now, they just follow the compass. The sea is now just a space to cross. Because of autopilots, sailors do not need to steer all the time. This gives Raban time to watch the waves closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can see our own experiences in stories from long ago or far away. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe things we feel but cannot say. They write clearly about things we find confusing. This is amazing, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves.

Reading and traveling help us escape our daily routine. When we are in a new place, we notice everything. The same happens when we read a great book. It helps us see things we ignored before. We start to notice the sky, people's faces, or feelings we didn't know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel stories were first in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made some small changes, but not many. I fixed a few mistakes. For example, in a story about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell later. I didn't change the story to predict this because it was written at that time. Like other travelers, I was there, not knowing what would happen next.

Traveling by plane lets people see the world, even if they know little about it. I believe travelers notice things. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

The word 'ecotourism' is often misused. It started in the 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators saw that travelers wanted to travel without harming nature. Now, 'ecotourism' can mean many things, like living with remote tribes or a short boat trip. It includes cultural interaction, nature, wildlife, or adventure. The original idea was to help people make good choices, but without clear rules, travelers can get confused.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time, but I didn't write much then. I stayed in friendly homes for weeks and stopped writing. I thought there was nothing to write about. When I moved, I wrote only short notes. I worried about the order of events when writing this book, but then I decided it didn't matter. I let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is not just a modern thing. It did not start only in the 1800s and 1900s with big businesses. Fashion, which means style and design, has been around for a long time. Historians say fashion began to grow in the 1500s and 1600s when people started trading more. As societies grew bigger and more complex, people found new ways to make different clothes and accessories. This made the meanings of clothes more complex too. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people and in different situations.

**Writer**

People often think that all writers are rich and famous because of stories about publishers fighting over new books. But for most writers, life is not like that. Many writers have other jobs during the day and write in the evenings. This way, they have a steady job even if their book does not become a hit. Some writers, like me, do different small jobs to make money. We might teach, run workshops, or write articles. I once heard about a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I never got it. Still, by doing part-time jobs and with help from friends, I manage to write my novels.

**Sudden Fame**

Our small shows around the country started to sell out, and we needed more security to handle the many excited fans. We had to use secret ways to enter the places we played to avoid being surrounded by fans. On nights when we were not performing, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched everything we did, and our managers took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I started to feel strangely confident. But I was still not used to being famous."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future Ahead**

Technology is changing how we live, work, and have fun. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians. Music is important for many reasons. Big events in the country always have music. For people, music is part of many activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the future, but what kind of music it will be. Also, will people still want to learn to play instruments? I think they will. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain. Musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help people learn other skills. In the USA, research shows that music can help with thinking skills. In Europe, studies show that group music lessons can help children with social skills and focus. Playing an instrument might also help people learn good study habits and be organized. Because of these reasons, people will still want to learn instruments.

In the future, music might change in two ways. First, people will listen to many different types of music. New styles will mix different kinds of music. Second, technology will help people make and play music. This will make it easier for people to create music, but there might be less need for live performances. More people of all ages might want to make music together in their communities. This will show the music traditions of each community.

To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. Music lessons and tests will need to change to stay important for more people. Musicians will need to learn new skills to teach and inspire people of all ages. They will need to work with big groups and learn communication and management skills. This is a big change from how things are now. It will also mean showing the public how good music teaching is. We need to make music more important in our lives. Music is very important, but people often forget this. Everyone in the music world needs to work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes people make fun of actors. This happens because actors often talk about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" But instead, actors often use big words or talk about gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, said that acting is interesting only when you do it, not when you talk about it. Each play is new, and actors learn from the characters and the writer. When a play ends, actors feel empty until the next one starts. Talking about acting can feel empty too.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man between boyhood and manhood. His performance is simple and confident. He understands the text well and controls his body and mind. Lester plays a young man who is a bit angry but also funny and lovable. His acting is very good, even if it looks simple. When you watch him, you see how he uses his body to show his character. This makes you think about what acting really is. Is it copying real life or creating something new? This is an important question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly when others speak. When it's their turn, they read the line, think about what it means, and then speak. For example, if the line is ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, imagine the scene, and then speak. The director says not to plan too much. Just be open and trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre makes you feel like you matter. Going to the theatre is special, and the staff should feel that too. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should be able to see and hear well. The size of the theatre is important. It should fit the human voice and body. Some old theatres did this well. They feel like they have history, like old church steps. You can't please everyone with a play. People don't always know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising. Otherwise, you could just stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was very popular with young people. But it also changed the lives of older people and the middle class. It helped create new rock stars. These new stars listened to rock and roll and knew it would be important for their future. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, heard this exciting music on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very important for young people who wanted to be rock stars. Just like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He wanted to stop just listening and start making his own music.

**Snow Adventure**

There was no clear path, but I thought I could walk safely if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I fell through the thin layer. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what I would do if the hole was deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. I knew I had to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that help researchers with qualitative research. These books talk a lot about how to collect data, but not much about how to analyze it. Many people find data analysis confusing. So, we asked different social scientists to talk about how they analyze data. We wanted to share ideas and understanding about this process, not just make a guidebook. This means making hidden steps more clear. This sounds easy, but it is not. We let our contributors show their work in different ways, like personal stories or more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting like a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn't remember much. Many people are excited about learning on the internet and computers, but is learning from a screen good? One writer tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words, but the son played with the pictures. The father thought, ""If he spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something."" TV, like my son and his noodles show, gives ideas but not always facts. Research says learning happens best when talking with teachers or parents. New technology can help teach children, but schools are still important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it at first, but they accepted it because it was successful. Success in Hollywood means making money at the box office. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make a star, but it must make money. In less than 100 years, Hollywood grew from a small village to a famous town like New York, Rome, or Paris. A century ago, you could walk through orange groves to the village store. Now, it is still like a village with one main topic: films. People talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to live somewhere else but work in Hollywood. It is the place where everyone in show-business wants to be.

**Photography**

Photography was invented in the 1800s by artists. They wanted to keep a lasting picture of what they saw. They used light, lenses, and chemicals to make images that were more real and detailed than paintings. Some artists were worried because photography was so different. Critics said photography was not art because it used machines. But photographers knew they had found a new way to show the world. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils to show nature and people.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, every children's book had illustrations. This was also true for many novels for older readers. Children's publishing was busy, but it often had low budgets. This meant some work was not very good, but the best artists always did their best. The black-and-white illustrations from this time are a mix of good and bad work. They are interesting for research or just looking. The best works will be shown again, either in new books or exhibitions. Some publishers might make new editions of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone online where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing too much online can be risky. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people, which can be exciting. We might think we can become rich or famous. So, we start sharing our secrets, photos, and stories online. But soon, we realize it can be dangerous and confusing.

This might sound sad, but don't worry. There is a way to understand this new world. A long time ago, some people started sharing their lives online. They learned about the problems and dangers before social media existed. These people, called bloggers, have already experienced what we are going through now. We can learn from their stories.

In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the internet. Back then, the internet was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He wrote about his life and shared photos and art. In 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people read it. Hall shared everything, and nothing was off-limits. It was like art, but one day, his blog disappeared. He posted a video called ""Dark Night"" and explained that he had fallen in love. He was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you. He stopped blogging, but the problem of sharing too much online is still here.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job, and one day, someone at work shared her blog with her bosses. She lost her job because of it. This shows that we often say things online that we wouldn't say in person. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and pretending they are separate can lead to big mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. She stopped blogging for a while but later started again, writing about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her blog helps support her family. She learned that just because we can say anything online doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and rich countries, people often cannot sleep well and feel worried. In the USA, 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books talk about people who cannot sleep or about places where sleep is studied. 

People are very interested in sleep. They want to know about sleep patterns, why we need sleep, and what happens when we cannot sleep. A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep. They sleep less when they are busy and wake up early to avoid traffic."" 

A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to sleep about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting.

In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise affects sleep, and how dangerous it is to drive when tired. They find people to study by advertising in student newspapers. These people are paid and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put electrodes on their heads, but they only study physical things.

In a dark room, there is a car simulator. People come at 2 pm, when they are naturally sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road looks endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many say they will not fall asleep, but they do. Dr. Reyner has a video of one person trying not to sleep. At first, he is awake, but then he starts to blink and nod off. The car goes off the road. Coffee can help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. She suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for people who work at night.

We know some things about sleep. Humans sleep in cycles like other animals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. We dream in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Scientists think women sleep half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they do not know why.

In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. Poor people liked this quiet time because they were free from work. By the 17th century, with more light, rich people started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours, changing sleep patterns for everyone.

In some places outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western societies, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. Continuous sleep is not possible because of noise, watching fires, and looking out for danger. It seems people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had a full cowboy outfit, but I knew I wasn't a real cowboy. I flew in from Denver early in the morning and thought I might look like a cowboy. But when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport, I knew I didn't fit in. He wore a dirty shirt and carried a bag, and he looked at my new boots and walked away.

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore. I wondered what I should do now. I thought I could talk about races on TV, but many other drivers wanted to do that too. I also tried to sell classic cars, but it didn't work out.

Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a world champion. Even if I was a champion, people would only listen for a short time. I miss racing cars, the speed, and the excitement. I miss being famous and having people want my autograph.

Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked at the sky and saw some birds in a cactus. They seemed to tell me to leave them alone. I realized I had a lot to learn about life outside of racing."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people like to walk on the city streets. If you walk with them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has a mild climate, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe environment, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about the new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Now, it is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like me, are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we try hard to make our writing have a big impact, so writing a simple letter is difficult for us. Real artists, who don't think about the effect of their words, don't have this problem. I think a real artist knows how to use words well. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about why they were so good, but they showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap star, a disc jockey, or a minor royal would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that famous people are not needed. Why pay a celebrity when anyone can open it for free? Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy didn't care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. The first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel happy and those at the back feel jealous."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

The film ""Citizen Kane"" came out in 1941. There was a lot of talk about it before it was released because people were worried about William Randolph Hearst, who the film was said to be about. Even though the reviews were very good, the film did not make much money at first. It was television that made it popular again. ""Citizen Kane"" is a film that has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said the film was successful because he did not know what he could or could not do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a film about a newspaper owner who was like Hearst. Welles thought this was a great chance for him to be both the director and the actor, so he worked very hard on it.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and might stop at the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she didn't really hear or understand. Dermot asked her if she would be okay and what she planned to do that day. Carmel smiled and said it was funny he asked because she had nothing to do, so she planned to walk downtown and look at the shops. She thought it was almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing. Dermot smiled back and said she deserved to enjoy herself. He also said if he was late, he wouldn't need anything to eat, so she shouldn't worry about making dinner. Carmel said that was fine.

**Title Race**

A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that job titles can create divisions among workers. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would rather have a better job title than a pay raise. This shows that people care a lot about their job titles. In today's world, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,"I was in Vienna to take photos. Taking photos was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light looked on things and how one photo could show the feeling of a place or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo. As long as I had film in my camera, I kept looking for that moment. 

Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well, and it became very famous. It was on the cover of many newspapers and magazines. After that, I decided to work for myself. But things didn't go as well as I hoped. The mid-1990s were not as successful as I thought they would be. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which was good.

I got the Vienna job by chance. I had taken photos of London for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons."" The book also included Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the job in Vienna, so they asked me to do it. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the other photographers. I was happy to go because things at home were not good.

They put me in a hotel in the center of Vienna. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy and hot trip. This time, in January, it was cold and different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great photos. 

On the first day, I didn't take any photos. I rode the trams around the city to feel its mood. The weather was cold and the city was beautiful. I wanted to make this Vienna my own, not like the other photographer's work. I waited for the right moment to take photos.

The next morning, I went out early. It had snowed, and the city was quiet and white. I wanted to take a photo of the cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one picture. Still, I knew it could be magical. Photography has always felt magical to me. Even when you know how it works, it still feels mysterious. That's why what happened that morning in Vienna didn't really surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**

Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has changed from a serious place to one full of wonder. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves has been important, even if not many people noticed it before. The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Guy Brett, who has studied this art for a long time, put it all together. There are not many explanations, so visitors can enjoy discovering things on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art is liked by many people, even those who usually do not care about art. People might like his work because it is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing things. Some people might like Hockney because he is a fun person and good for news stories. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. But maybe he seems less important because he is very popular, not because his work is bad. Hockney knows he is not a great artist and thinks only time will tell how important his work is.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**

I have seen many art exhibitions, some good and some not so good. Sometimes exhibitions try to show a common idea among artists, but it does not always work. I wanted to make a different kind of show. With seven artists, I used a space in an empty warehouse. The show was called 'Window-shopping.' It was a collection of different artworks that were only connected because they were all art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley broke a video camera, and it flickered on a screen. These works were very different, but they worked well together. I did not try to make a big statement about art, but I think art is something personal where artists decide what they want to do.

**Art History**

Some people who like paintings do not want to analyze them because they think it will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus more on theory than on the pleasure of looking at art. This is like thinking that knowing how a dish is made will make it taste less good. But knowing more about art can make it more enjoyable. Our enjoyment of art is also influenced by the society we live in. While enjoying art is important, thinking about it does not have to take away from the experience."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

A long time ago, people in the Stone Age might have been interested in metals because they wanted to look nice. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, and finding a shiny yellow stone. This stone was gold. It was not like other stones; it was soft and pretty. People liked it very much. Gold became important to them. Copper was another metal they found, maybe by accident. When they saw how useful copper tools were, they looked for more copper. They learned how to take copper from rocks. This is how metalworking started and helped people live better lives.

**St Ives**

We walked down a narrow, stone street with our bags. The wind was very strong, and the waves were cold and big. No one was outside, and all the houses by the water were closed up tight. We saw the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The sky was dark and grey. Visiting Cornwall in the winter without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I told my friend we would have nice walks by the sea and warm evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in good and bad times are not here anymore. We do not know why they moved or stayed in places. Archaeology gives us some ideas, but we cannot test them. We cannot see the past again. But maybe we can. With computer modelling, we can make old landscapes and put digital people in them. These digital people act a bit like real people. We can change things like rain or the number of people and see how they react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the leader male monkey saw a new male monkey near their trees. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the leader might lose his position. The leader monkey had a clever idea to keep the new monkey away. When the new monkey tried to come closer, the leader made a loud call that means a leopard is near. The new monkey got scared and went back to his trees. This happened many times. But then, the leader made a mistake. He made the leopard call while he was walking calmly on the ground. 

**What Cats Catch**

In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor thought that if all cats in Britain caught the same, they would catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true because most cats live in towns and catch less. The important question is if the number of animals caught is too much. The answer seems to be no. In winter, people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to live. The survey showed that cats catch many animals, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly and make loud noises. They go to the reed beds in the water. They stand at the edge, making noises about how tired they are. Then, the leader buffalo goes into the water, and the others follow. They move slowly and seem very tired, but they swim to the reeds. They spend the day there, eating green plants.

**PICASSO, Pablo**

In 1940, Picasso painted fish while he was in a fishing town called Royan. The painting shows a fish seller's table with a crab and some fish. The fish look like they are still alive. The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used flat shapes and soft colors. It looks calm, like an underwater world. But there is also a feeling of danger. The fish and crab look like they might fight. The sharp shapes in the painting make it feel tense."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown to show us moments in time and space. It lets us see quick moments and both big and small things. Photography has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth and even from space. It also shows us the complex and difficult parts of modern life. Photography is a very important way to show what it means to be human.

But, using pictures to record events is much older. The first pictures go back to about 35,000 years ago. We do not know exactly why early people made cave paintings. They might show real hunting events, be used for magic to help with hunting, be religious symbols, or just to make places look nicer. Pictures are a big part of human culture.

People have always asked if pictures show the truth and what their role in society is. Many people believe that ""seeing is believing,"" so pictures have always been important. When photography was invented in the 1800s, it was thought to give a true picture of the world. The camera was seen as a tool that works like the human eye, giving a fixed image that looks like what we see. This made photography a big achievement in culture, creating images that artists worked hard to make by hand.

Some people thought everyone could understand photos, like a ""universal language."" In 1933, photographer August Sander said even people far away could understand a photo of the sky. But as global communication grew, we need to ask if photos can be understood the same way by everyone. Is photography like language, shaped by culture? Do we take photos for granted and not see how they show reality?

Photography is seen as giving clear evidence, making it seem like a simple way to communicate. It is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. Photos have moved from being just memories to historical documents. They show us about the people and society that made them.

I want to show that the camera is not just a quiet recorder of events. Photography can help bring social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 1400s changed how people saw the world with new ways of showing perspective. Photography has helped create the media culture we have today and shows the tough realities of the world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a dangerous area where you have to be careful. There are no strict rules, but you need to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination be free. Some people need to feel safe to write a poem, while others write when they are sad. Some people write at certain times, and others wait for inspiration. All these ways are okay as long as you are true to yourself. It's important to listen to your inner voice and let it grow.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if necessary. A character's memory can help move the story forward. Dialogue, or conversation between characters, is very useful. It can show different sides of a story quickly and keep the reader interested. A short story should not have too many words, but it should still have conflict and action. Every word should be important.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know what will happen next, but you learn as you go. In chess, you need a long-term plan, not just short moves. The more you play, the more you understand the game. Screenwriting is similar; you need to see the whole story, not just parts of it.

**Looking at Writing**

Speaking is natural for humans, but writing is not. All people speak, but not everyone writes. Writing systems were created by a few advanced societies and improved over time. In the past, many children did not learn to read or write. Even today, some children find it hard. Children naturally learn to speak, but writing is something they have to learn with effort. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn it."
CPE_8,"I have never started writing a book with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up things to fill the gaps and make the story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I just want to write what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have changed the names of the people in this story, and I have made sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When he dies, he might not leave any mark on the world, like a stone thrown into a river leaves no mark on the water. If anyone reads my book, it will be because they find it interesting. But maybe the way he lived and his strong and kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was special. Then, people who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book will be helpful to people who want to write about my friend. I don't claim that the conversations I wrote are exactly what was said. I never took notes, but I remember well, and I believe I have written them truthfully. I said earlier that I have not made up anything, but I have added some conversations to make the story more lively. I want people to read my book, and I think it's okay to make it interesting. Smart readers will know where I have added things, and they can choose to ignore them. Another reason I was worried about writing this book is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is hard to really know people from a different country. People are shaped by where they were born, the games they played, the food they ate, and the schools they went to. You can't know these things just by hearing about them; you have to live them. Because of this, it is hard to make people from another country seem real in a book. I have only written about people from my own country before, and if I wrote about others in short stories, it was because you can be brief. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't pretend my characters see themselves as I see them; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,"**Poetry Recitals**

In every time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to people living in it. Over time, we can see patterns and understand which writers are important. Today, there are many different styles of poetry and ideas about what poetry should be. Some poets write poems to be read in books, while others like to perform their poems in front of people. 

This difference is not always clear. In the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more popular. Small groups in towns have poetry events in local halls or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals often have poetry readings by famous poets. 

These events have different effects on poets. For poets who write simple poems to perform, public readings are good. Their poems are easy to understand when heard once. But for poets who work hard to create deep and complex poems, it can be hard for audiences to appreciate their work in a single hearing. These poets might choose to read their simpler poems to connect with the audience quickly.

Listening to poetry is not the same as reading it. Hearing poets read their work can help people understand the poems better. It is good if the audience can read along or know the poems before the reading. 

The main reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes mixed with music, is to make people enjoy poetry. This way, people see poetry as fun and not just for a special group of people."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are using more oral evidence, but it has problems. When someone tells their story, it is not always a clear picture of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person talking can affect each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is influenced by the historian's position and how they understand history. Historians help create new evidence, so they must be careful. Also, the person talking is not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with things they heard from other places, like TV. They might remember the past as better than it was or feel upset about things that happened later. Feelings and attitudes can make a story seem true, but they might come from later events, not the past.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animals: looking at how their bodies work and looking at their behavior. Physiologists study how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create behavior. People who study the whole animal look at the animal's behavior and what affects it. In this group, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs with animals like rats and pigeons to see how they learn. Ethologists study animals' natural behavior, often in the wild. These two groups are now working more together. Physiologists think their methods are very important. But even if we know how every nerve cell works, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own way of being organized. Describing a bird building a nest by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

When students start studying social science, they have two jobs. They need to learn about the subject and how to study it. They must know the facts and research in the books and also understand how this knowledge is found and organized. These two parts are connected. We all know about social life from daily life, so social sciences might seem like common sense. But social sciences go beyond common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of social life, uses different study methods, and has its own ideas. These basic ideas help social scientists go beyond everyday understanding and make each subject different.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He used some Greek words for these ideas, which came from an earlier Greek source we don't have now. Vitruvius did not include utility and function in his definition, but he did talk about the best ways to build for different uses. At the start, the focus was on beauty and art. Classical architecture has a complex history. Before, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms were important and influenced later architecture. Even if a classical temple looks fancy, it is basically a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the area, going over a small bridge with a bump, which was her only mistake. She finished her drive near the gasworks, where it smelled like sulphur. When Chen found out, he was amused and not upset. He was happy that Lily could drive and started planning a trip with her. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, leaving early and coming back by midday to avoid losing customers. Lily practiced driving in the meantime.

Mui, even though she was worried, bought a road map and got a discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit hurt that Mui didn't trust her navigation skills. They left home and soon reached the English Channel. Lily drove very well, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions, had to admit it. Lily overtook some slow cars with great skill, and Chen even clapped for her.

They arrived at a seaside town and parked in a street with empty parking spaces. Lily wasn't sure about the road signs, so she paid to park to avoid any trouble. She locked the van carefully. Chen joked that no one would want their old van, which annoyed the sisters. Lily and Mui told Chen he was being ungrateful and too proud.

Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. He decided that Man Kee would have a good education and own many restaurants one day. The sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship in the distance and used a telescope to look at it. He showed Man Kee the ship and told him it was special, like them, and would take them home one day.

Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily tried to look through the telescope, but it had stopped working. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily only saw seagulls."
CPE_43,"Title: The Well

I read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I wanted to try this, so I asked you to help me. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle, but I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights. Later, I realized they looked like stars in cartoons when someone gets hit.

At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved. I was also angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I wanted to shout back, but you sounded scared, so I stayed quiet. You ran to get help. I climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked shocked.

I felt excited but then saw the wet spots I left on the ground. I was scared they would see them. Father was looking into the well with a flashlight. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I wanted to get back at you, but now I was in trouble. I realized my plan was not smart. I needed a new plan.

I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed, so no one could check it. Father looked at me like he didn't believe me. He said, ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" and walked away. Arthur looked at me sadly, knowing I was lying. I felt ashamed because they didn't believe me, and I realized lying was wrong."
CPE_51,"**Moving Day**

Susan is a widow, and her children are grown up. She has to leave her family home. The moving van says ""Removers of Distinction."" Susan sees that everything special in the house is being packed by Fred, the removal man, and his team. Fred is careful with the breakable things, but his helpers are not as gentle.

The house is beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbor. Susan remembers the years spent there with her children. When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five, asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert is an adult and is helping with the move. He is making sure Susan doesn't talk about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very careful with the Steinway piano.

Fred, the removal man, says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks if people cry when they move. Fred says, ""You'd be surprised. They are happy until everything is in the van, then they cry in the empty room. But they are fine at the new place.""

Susan remembers when they first moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. It took a long time to get it inside. Her husband Peter solved the problem by taking out a window and using a crane to bring the piano in. It was expensive, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months.

Now, Susan is older, and the children are busy. She finds it hard to move around the house. She thinks about the stairs and the banister rails that were never fixed properly. She worries about the piano, but it's too late to warn the movers.

Fred tells her, ""It's just the piano to come now."" Susan is nervous. Robert and Francesca watch as the piano is moved. Fred and his team carefully bring it down the stairs and out the door. They put it behind the van.

Robert laughs first, and then Susan and Francesca join in. They are relieved that the move is over. They laugh so much that they cry tears of laughter. As they leave the house for the last time, they walk arm in arm, happy and laughing."
CPE_11,"**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**

Writing your own book reviews online: is it just for fun? When the Internet started, the idea was that everyone could use it. In theory, anyone could write or share things online. But in the beginning, you needed some technical skills to do this. However, one area that became open to everyone was book reviews. 

Amazon.com, the first big online bookstore, allowed anyone to write a book review. This meant anyone could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This helped Amazon fill its pages with free reviews. People looking to buy a book could see what other readers thought, not just what the publisher or professional critics said. Other online bookstores did the same, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the online market. 

Because anyone could write a review, there were some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted every day, so it was hard to check them all. Amazon had a team to make sure reviews followed their rules. For example, reviews couldn't be just one word, attack the author, use bad language, give away the ending, or talk about other reviews. But reviewers were anonymous, so some people wrote fake reviews. 

For example, some writers wrote good reviews for their own books. One writer, Lev Grossman, wrote fake positive reviews for his book after getting bad ones. He was caught when he wrote about what he did, and the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their own books, but Amazon didn't always check if the comments were really from the author. 

Sometimes, readers wrote very critical reviews. For example, when James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team came out, people in the book wrote angry reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days. 

Amazon liked that many people wrote reviews because it was good for business. They watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were often found on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a computer term. 

Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they helped people decide if a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books was hard because you had to pretend to have feelings about them. This is why letting everyone write reviews is a good thing."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last 200 years, people often think that artists must be different from others. We like art that is new, surprising, and different. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But with today's art, we sometimes feel unsure and say it is not art. The media often say this, and we agree because we expect art to be new and confusing. We think artists are special and different from us, with talents that break the rules. In the past, people asked artists to make art for specific reasons, and it was part of everyday life. Now, we let artists do what they want and get upset if they try to be like everyone else.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

Usually, when a painter finds success in one style, they stick to it. People who buy art like to see the same kind of work. But some artists try new things. Picasso and Hockney are examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He likes railways and has made 40 paintings and drawings of the underground world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers say only a sick person would come to such a remote place. I am here to heal myself. I am alone except for an old woman who comes to clean the house. I am not happy or unhappy. I think about the past. Art may seem useless, but it helps us see the true meaning of life. Artists use their imagination to find joy and understand life better. This is why we create art."
CPE_63,"Family Business

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my fancy girls' school. I had won the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. My father talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. He usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was about to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand things quickly, you like talking, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""

""Be that as it may,"" he said, ""I feel your heart's not going to be in the family business now. You'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

Like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to explore other jobs. But I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and I got used to taking care of him. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, nice schools, clothes, parties, theatres, and operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always lively.

""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved not to make immediate decisions and avoid my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house, a small white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I might get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew if I focused, he might be right. I felt confident and ready.

But my father told me he needed me for one last important job for the family business. ""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important.""

I could tell my father didn't understand my pressures (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him) and would see a refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the job, I saw his dedication and energy. He was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which was not a good idea. At first, it seemed like a smart move because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois got a raise at her advertising job, making thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found this in a cheaper area, but Lois wanted a better address for their social status. 

Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as his. They needed both their salaries to maintain their lifestyle.

Now, their situation was at risk because of Venetia. She came to their office very upset after court. She accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed the jury four years ago and did nothing about it. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty and scared. He wished he had been prepared and said something different. Venetia's anger and disgust worried him because it could ruin his career. He didn't know what she would do, but even a rumor could end his career."
CPE_36,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous. I believed people wouldn't care if the houses were old and the gardens were messy. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, but tonight I am watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I have cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It's a small London garden where plants grow tall. 

My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window. She writes books that are not published, and sometimes I have to pretend to like them because I am an English teacher. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she says. Then she offers to bring a drink. I don't want her in the garden, but she comes anyway. 

Jaz sits in the chair and says, 'Cheers. I should have been a teacher. Writers don't get holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' I think, some people can't write or teach. 'What are your plans for the holidays?' she asks. I feel worried about the empty days ahead. I say, 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' My heart races as I ask. 'Of course,' Jaz says. 'If I'm around,' knowing she will be. 

'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun,' I lie. 'We've known each other since we were eight.' I often deal with fiction. 'What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks. I haven't read much of it. I like the title and tell her. I say, 'Try writing about nice people for a change.' Jaz is upset. 'I keep a journal,' I say. 'I write something good about each day.' Jaz says, 'Get a life, Ann.' 

I have a life. I work, and I go out sometimes. When we go inside, I remember my school teacher, Miss Tarrantine. She used to say, 'I've had my moments,' and we would laugh."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it helps people feel connected to the past. We often know about our family history, like who our grandparents were and stories about their lives. But it's also important to learn about our wider history to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of belonging and continuity. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit culture from past generations. Even if there are parts of our heritage we don't like, it is still part of us. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It affects our customs and the things we use every day. In the past, we learned about our history through stories from our ancestors. But now, because of changes in society, many of these stories are lost. Instead, we learn from places and buildings that remind us of the past. It is important to keep these places to remember our ancestors.

**The Fens**

I wrote a book called ""Waterland"" about a place in England called the Fens. At first, I thought the Fens were just flat and empty, a simple place for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not just flat or empty. They are very English but also feel strange and different. Many people in England think the Fens are foreign, even though they are in the middle of the country. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and both open and mysterious. I did not visit many places in the Fens while writing my book. I like to imagine places rather than just describe them exactly. The Fens are not just a place but also a feeling.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, museums just put things in cases with long labels. Now, museums should make displays interesting and fun, using different techniques to catch people's attention. Museums should also share their collections with as many people as possible. For example, they can lend objects to schools or use them to help elderly people with memory problems. Museums show real objects, not copies. They help people see and understand things from the past. This is what makes them different from theme parks or books. Museums that make their displays exciting and easy to understand will find that people want to see the real things they have.

**Architecture and Environment**

People have always wanted to keep things from the past, but now changes in our towns happen very quickly. This makes some people want to preserve things more. People who have lived through big events, like wars, often want to keep things that show stability. If people need to preserve things, city planners should think about this. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used in ads for smart things like computers and encyclopedias. Many people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he made some difficult theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for having strange ideas that are different from what we see every day. Einstein was part of a big change in science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better by studying matter and forces. Einstein helped by looking at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before, people thought about the universe like Isaac Newton did, with stars and planets moving in a fixed space and time. Einstein said that time and space are not fixed but change depending on other things.

**Young Readers**

When we were kids, Lydia and I didn't like books that won prizes because we thought they would be boring. Our mom didn't like that we thought this way, but our dad would give us small amounts of money to read these books. He would also give us some of these books as gifts, with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. We thought most of these books were for boys, but sometimes we found some good short stories and once, a famous book of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm said that the start of human language is a big mystery. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad, and people in dangerous places made these noises. Some words today might come from these sounds, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" or ""mors"" meaning ""death"" in Latin. Because of these strange ideas, many people didn't want to talk about how language started. But now, it is an important area of study. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used language to be friendly and for power, not just to share information. This is different from what philosopher John Locke thought, who said language was mainly for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from a writer's point of view. Most reviews are written quickly and don't last long. They have deadlines and are usually short. Once published, they are only read for a short time, like a day or a week. People often think reviews are not very important. Many believe writers do reviews because they need money or because they can't work on big projects all the time. But writing reviews is a skillful job. It's different to write a short review for a newspaper and a long one for an international journal. A reviewer must think about who will read the review, from casual readers to those very interested in the topic. Reviewers need to know a lot about many things and write clearly so people can understand and enjoy their writing. Reviewers often write other things too. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews between writing his novels. He collects his reviews in books, even if they are short. Some people think only famous writers should keep their reviews, but others believe anyone can if they think their reviews are good. I feel this way about my own work. I am mainly an academic, and my serious books are academic. In English-speaking countries, it's normal for people to write both reviews and academic books. In the past, some academics didn't like professors writing reviews, but now it's more accepted. There is more reviewing work now, so many people can do it. I think this is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It's also good for professors because it helps them stay connected with non-academics. When professors talk to each other, they might use complex language, but when writing reviews, they need to be clear. In the end, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. When he walked into the dark and quiet hallway, he felt a small worry about owning the place. Even after three years, he sometimes felt this way when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the apartment, he used to come home excited and curious, often as early as he could. He wondered what the apartment was like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that he couldn't change it. Sometimes, there were letters by the door or messages on the answering machine when he got home. He was glad the windows weren't broken and nothing was stolen. From his boring office on the third floor of a building on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to spending three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the busy office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he didn't need to be alone anymore, but he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he wanted to be alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt lonely and thought that doing a job he didn't like had changed him, taking him away from who he thought he was. He often read or listened to music at night, but now he wondered why he did these things. His thoughts and feelings were unclear, and he couldn't find a connection. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have done something different if he had known his own worth. After university, he tried to make a plan for a better life, but he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends and followed their paths, not thinking he could find a job that made him happy. He went to one job interview and didn't think much about the job itself. It was an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was happy to have a nice conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would have later. Neil offered him the job right away, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. A special area was set up for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they like to eat everything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we had not seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs. The torch batteries were low, so we put in new ones, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we felt hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we could not see it. Time felt like it stopped, and we kept moving.

**How to be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and shareholders. How can I get better and feel more confident? You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework and prepare well. Ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They need time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise, it will not turn out well. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot gets tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things we think about quickly, like solving puzzles or doing math. But other things take longer, like learning or understanding complex ideas. If we rush these, they might not work well, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

We think and learn in different ways and at different speeds. Sometimes we need to think fast, like when reacting to danger. For example, if you are riding a bike and start to fall, your body reacts quickly to keep you safe. This fast thinking is called 'wits'. 

Other times, we need to think slowly and carefully. This is called 'intellect'. It is used when solving problems, like fixing a car or doing homework. People who are good at this are called 'bright' or 'clever'.

There is also a slower way of thinking. It is more relaxed and dreamy. This is when we are daydreaming or thinking deeply about something. It is important to let our minds wander sometimes. This slow thinking helps us understand complex problems and be creative. 

Scientists are learning more about this slow thinking. It helps us see patterns and solve difficult problems. It is important to use both fast and slow thinking in our lives."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly and well-supplied camp in a very faraway place. There are about forty people here, like scientists, students, and weather experts. We all help each other. My basic French is just enough to talk, but not to have fun conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a big problem for me, but at first, I felt less confident. I was a bit scared of mealtimes. I would wait, worried about which table to sit at, and nervous when everyone got quiet when I spoke. I felt anxious like I did when I first started school. I still smile a lot or get nervous when people talk to me. I think this sometimes makes me feel sad because I am not as good at talking as I usually am.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he did not pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face, though, and when I saw him again, he shook my hand nicely but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he often did not notice me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and Elliot started to like me more. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success, I made many new friends and saw him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock said he did not care much about the story or acting in his films. He cared about the photography, music, and technical parts. For Hitchcock, it was not the message or acting that moved people. He thought people reacted to the film itself, no matter where they were from. If a film was made well, people from Japan and India would react the same way. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius who liked to make audiences scream. He did not guess or think deeply about his characters. He focused on making films that had a strong effect on people."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good. Now, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Computers help make charts and analyze observations. This makes it a great time for amateur astronomers. However, some things are not as good. You might need to travel 80 km to see a clear sky like people did in cities 50 years ago. Airplanes leave trails in the sky that can turn into clouds, making it hard to see the sun or stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices. There are many things to do and buy. New products come out very quickly. This can make people feel tired and stressed. More choices mean more stress and less time. People are looking for simple things that make life meaningful. But it is hard to make life simple when there are so many products. There are more types of soap and cereal than we need, and many software updates and phone plans to keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother. We do not let anything change this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are like us: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like rude shop assistants or waiters who act too friendly. I know most of the guests because they have been coming here since they were children. We greet each other politely but do not talk much. It is nice to have privacy and respect, which is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

A special show of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" moved from Stratford to London. I want to change my earlier review of the show. When it first opened, I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and criticized his acting. I still think Othello should be older than Desdemona, but I was wrong about Mr. Fearon's acting. His performance is amazing. The whole cast is great. Some memorable parts are when Cassio's games with other officers become dangerous, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The show is exciting and full of tension. Don't miss it!

**Lake Vostok**

In the middle of Antarctica, there is no movement. On the edges, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the center, there is no life. Except for a large hidden lake called Lake Vostok, under almost 4 kilometers of ice. It is the coldest place on earth. The water has been without air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are excited to explore the lake and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning to study the lake. In the next few years, we will learn a lot about Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting talk on the radio last week. Some scientists are discussing why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn about everything, from atoms to black holes. They wonder why science cannot explain why we want to know these things. It is important to know if what scientists do is right, instead of just talking about why we do it. The main point is that science is a tool, and we should decide how to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Food is very important and makes us happy. Many people love cooking and buy cookbooks. We often think we need a special occasion to cook something nice, but that's not true. You can make a tasty soup by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is better than buying soup from a packet or a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with many chemicals, you can make a delicious one in five minutes that everyone will love. Cooking is a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important in our lives, and we celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other events with meals. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party!

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to clean his messy office. Papers were everywhere, and he had many tax forms and books. As he went up in the elevator, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She liked things to be neat and on time. He wondered how she would react to the mess. Mrs. Wilson, the cleaning lady, came while he was trying to clean. He hoped she would help, but she didn't want to clean his office. She thought he was from somewhere far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.

**Karen**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She created her own story of strength. When she was twelve, her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the doctor said she was okay. She only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking across the village green. She was excited and sad about what she saw. In a small village, it's exciting to know something first. But she was sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He was her doctor for many years and helped her with her throat problems. He always listened to his patients and made them feel important. The village loved him for this, and he was very kind and funny."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She also writes books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is famous for her amazing piano performances. She plays many styles of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it for him. She believes that the first piano lessons are very important.

Joanna has written a piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" She did this even though she is very busy with concerts and running her own recording label, Sound Circus. Joanna thinks everyone should have the chance to learn music, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.

When she was younger, Joanna taught beginners how to play the piano. She grew up with many children learning music at her home because her mother was a piano teacher. Joanna believes music should be for everyone, not just for those with special talent.

Some children learn piano quickly, but others take more time. Joanna is interested in helping all children enjoy music. She worries that some parents push their children too hard to be like famous kids on TV. She thinks music should be fun and not just about meeting parents' expectations.

Joanna's books are colorful and fun. They include stories and CDs with music to help children learn. She believes learning should be enjoyable. She encourages children to try different things on the piano, like playing on the black keys and using the pedals.

As children learn more, they need to practice reading music. Joanna knows this can be hard because she also found it challenging when she was young. She believes practice is very important. Joanna practices a lot now, and she enjoys it. She says it's important to know what you want to achieve before you start practicing. Her advice is to mix hard and easy pieces and enjoy playing."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is not enjoyable to read. This means that good writing is often difficult to create. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not make many mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is slow and makes you think carefully. It is hard to change or erase, so you write with care. On a computer, it is easy to be careless because you can quickly change things. Many writers find that they spend the same amount of time fixing computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Also, emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. People say emails have brought back the art of love letters, but they often lack the emotion and care of handwriting. Words on a screen can seem harsh and lose their true meaning.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back. I agreed and gave the disc to him carefully. ""It's incredible they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, putting it in the hi-fi. He pressed a button, and a drawer opened. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I like them..."" he said. I asked, ""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" ""No,"" he replied. ""You only play one side."" I asked why, and he didn't know. He thought for a moment and said, ""Good question."" He smiled and showed me the best place to sit for the stereo sound. I was happy to ask a question he couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were invented after lighters, we would think they were better. People often say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing, but they forget that big changes take time. In 1979, a book said that books would disappear in the 1980s. This was not true. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so people usually don't do it. Computers make it easy to read small parts of text. Some people say this is a new way to tell stories, but reading parts of a book is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. Computers do not encourage reading everything in one go.

**The Office**

Charles walked into his office and saw everything in order. The carpet was clean, and the desk was just as he remembered it from an auction. Files were neatly put away, and trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen struggled to close a filing cabinet and said, ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" Charles admired the room and avoided talking about computers. He had known Kathleen for two years, and they often talked about this. She did not understand why he resisted technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. Kathleen was the reason he wrote that paper. She could use any software and make it do amazing things."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there often. But now, he was there all the time. He found that staying away caused too many problems. He thought about how he went from being an important advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to someone always trying to stop problems, with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder and putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but he was not easy to work with. Lancelot read the synopsis again. It was not new. He closed the folder. Ian's manuscript seemed like it would never come. The synopsis was not brilliant, and it felt like Ian had lost interest. Lancelot remembered a story about a famous author whose last book was published after his death, chapter by chapter. But Ian had already been paid a lot. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre quickly, but Ian's talent stayed hidden. He was difficult to work with. He was supposed to edit a big arts magazine, but it never came out. He had a contract with a fashion magazine, but he didn't produce much. At meetings, he was clever but critical. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"Text: 'The breakfast change in England

Health experts say breakfast is very important. But in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, people did not often talk about breakfast. Sometimes, travelers ate early before long trips, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast became normal for everyone. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. But there were also big social changes. For example, people started working set hours, often starting very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for rich people.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal ideas, and cultural rules. In this book, we will learn how these things change the style and meaning of a photo and how people see it. For example, when someone looks at a photo in a newspaper, they might think they understand it. But we can ask if the photo shows the scene exactly as it was or if it shows what the photographer thinks. Is the moment in the photo very important, or is the photo a symbol of something bigger in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves completely. You need to focus only on your goal to be the best. Sport is tough, and you have to do it yourself. It teaches you to be disciplined and determined, and also how to work with a team. My sport lets you be great alone, but it is also a team game. Like in life, you can do well by yourself, but you should remember others are around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened many opportunities and shown me things around the world. But you also have to give up a lot to get these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences stay very clear in our memory. For me, one special moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song was so amazing that I stayed awake. The bird's music reminded me of jazz and Indian classical music. It felt like the bird was giving a special, live performance. I was amazed by the bird's music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Birds have always been important in human culture. People have different feelings about them, like love or fear. But what do birds say about us? Paul Evans talks about this. 

In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is hitting the glass. Some people think wrens bring messages or signs. Is it trying to tell me something, or is it just stuck? Maybe both are true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed the way wrens flew could bring good or bad luck. Today, we still see wrens in pictures and decorations in British homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens are still special to us. A forest without wrens feels empty.

Our connection with birds is old and deep. In the past, people watched birds to know about danger, weather, or food. Birds were also linked to dreams and the supernatural. Our interest in birds shows something about us. We admire their flight, song, and freedom. Some people think these feelings are old and not needed now, but they are still part of us. Birds are important for understanding environmental changes. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because we lose not only the birds but also their cultural meaning. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have special meanings in love and magic. Losing them is a big cultural loss.

Folklore, or old stories and legends, is important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that science cannot. They help us feel and understand birds better. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we get is hard to explain with science. Birds are fascinating, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their messages. The wren in the greenhouse is like a puzzle, connecting the past, present, and future with its song."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

A map shows how places and features on Earth relate to each other. It uses distance and direction to do this. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like ""a day's walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This told more about how easy it was to travel than the actual distance. 

Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, exact direction was not very important. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions.

Early maps used signs to show important landmarks. These signs could be realistic or simple and varied in size to show importance. The style of maps changed depending on their purpose and where they were made. To understand old maps, you need to know the style used.

The history of making maps, called cartography, is about making maps more accurate and detailed. Cartographers, or map makers, used other sciences to help them. For example, they used the magnetic compass to find direction instead of using the sun or stars. They also used tools to measure angles accurately.

As people explored more, they tried to map the world. Astronomers found out that Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is slightly flat at the poles. This changed how large areas were mapped.

Over time, different people needed maps. Not just travelers and merchants, but also soldiers, archaeologists, historians, and geographers. Soldiers needed maps to show land features accurately for planning battles. This led to the invention of contour lines on maps. 

Today, cartographers make maps for many things, like showing climate, land use, and more. Maps are important for understanding many sciences. This has led to a new interest in making maps.

The history of maps is not a straight line. There were times of slow progress and times of fast change. Sometimes old ideas stayed even when new ones came. Map makers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. 

Old maps were often copied because it was easier and cheaper. This means maps should not always be trusted as true evidence of what people knew at the time. Many maps we have today show the hard work and thinking of people in the past. This makes studying old maps interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"Text: 'TIM RICE I was invited into a young man's living room. It was a nice and calm place, different from the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, and the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across. He also had Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history. He had nine months before starting and wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference was that my dreams were not as serious to me. When Andrew suggested I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I decided to try. Andrew played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very good. He played more music from shows he had written at school, and it reminded me of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for a song I had written that was recorded by a pop group. We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theatre, but I knew Andrew was very talented and determined. I thought it would be a good idea to work with him. Even if we didn't succeed in musical theatre, we could try to compete with famous bands like the Beatles and Rolling Stones. The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, my excitement about working with Andrew faded a bit. I still looked for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and wrote simple songs that suited my voice. But I thought I would probably become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. My father thought I would stop liking pop music by the time I was twenty-one, which worried me. But I decided to see Andrew again. It would be fun to write musical lyrics with him. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture. He also supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't sure about the musical idea he was working on, about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who started orphanages. The story was good but didn't excite me. It was too similar to the show Oliver. But Andrew believed in his music, and it was catchy. I didn't know much about musicals, but I thought we could be successful. I started writing lyrics with enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew told me the plot, played the tunes, and gave me the titles. I skipped a day at the office, pretending to be sick, to write my first theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed my career.'"
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have a special ability: we can use language to communicate with each other. Language is a big part of our lives, and it's hard to think about life without it. If you see two or more people together, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as an 'instinct'. This means people know how to talk naturally, like how spiders know how to make webs. Spiders didn't learn to make webs from school or a special spider teacher.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather are made by the air around us and they affect where animals and plants live. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places can have tropical jungles with many different plants and animals. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather is made by big movements of air because the air is always moving. This happens because the Earth spins, and the air moves at a different speed. The sun also makes the air move.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success depends on its coffee. I had to learn a lot about making coffee and taking care of the espresso machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making coffee is not easy. I thought I would have to clean ashtrays again. But my boss was patient. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does TV often fail with shows about art? Painting and sculpture should be easy for TV because cameras can show the whole artwork and then zoom in on details. But few TV series show the joy and complexity of art well. An example is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British viewers American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on great artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer and became known for taking risks. Metals are less controlled than other markets. With some luck, risk-taking, and market knowledge, you can make a lot of money. Risk is a big part of the industry. This fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, free-trade economists see that the market is not keeping metal prices high. More minerals are being taken out, and raw material costs are going down. Adjusted for inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island is unique and has something special. To get around Abaco and its islands, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go on your own. Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' because of its calm, protected waters. These waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"Title: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK

At the Bamboo Bike Club in London, you can join a course to build your own bamboo bike. Engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan run the club. They offer a weekend course where you can make a custom bike frame designed on a computer.

The workshop is in Hackney Wick, east London. On a Saturday morning, you can hear the sound of machines as people start building bikes. The atmosphere is full of energy and fun.

Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have brought back this old way of making bikes. However, buying a ready-made bamboo bike can be very expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868.

James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for everyone. They spent years working on their idea in a shed in Wales. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making a bike, not just sell them. So, they started the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more like a community than a business.

The course is affordable and includes a custom bike frame and a fun weekend of building. On the first day, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You glue the bamboo tubes together to form the bike's frame. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks.

Building the bike is a challenge, but James and Ian are there to help. They check every step and help if you have trouble. Many people who join the course are engineers, but anyone can do it. If you make a mistake, you can try again with a new piece of bamboo.

On Sunday, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. The bamboo bike is strong and can last a long time. Ian rides his bike to work every day, and James has tested his bike off-road.

Bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They might look a bit rough, but they are unique. They are great for a relaxed ride, not for racing. The bamboo frame makes the ride smooth and comfortable.

The best part is the price. You can build your own bamboo bike for less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought the book would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book is about how men and women can talk better to each other. This book is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry helps people who want to improve their lives. It also makes a lot of money for book publishers in New York. In Britain, many self-help books are published, but not all are good. Many books are not published because they are too similar to others or too specific. Editors look for books that can sell well. They ask questions like, ""Is the author easy to promote?"" and ""Does the book have a good title?"" If a book has a catchy title, it is more likely to sell.

**Autobiographies**

When someone writes an autobiography, they make a promise to tell the truth. But often, writers do not tell the whole truth. They might leave out things that are too embarrassing or not important. Sometimes, writers make up stories to show the truth better. Some writers call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. Readers might think they are reading a true story, but it could be fiction. Writers do this not to be mean, but to tell a good story.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories became popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These stories show the problems in society. A crime in a detective story represents human desires like greed. Solving the crime shows how society can work well again. In Hammett's stories, society is not perfect. The detective and the criminal are similar. The detective understands the criminal. The detective is both a good person and a bit of a crook. Sometimes, the detective feels guilty about this. Other times, he is very eager to catch the criminal.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at a hotel to talk about writing. Gould said that to write well, you need to understand the culture you are writing about. Science is like its own world, and only scientists can write about it well. Gould believes you should not talk down to readers. You can make the language simple, but not the ideas. If readers feel you are treating them like they are not smart, they will not like your writing."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym in the City of London, it feels very cold because of the air-conditioning. The gym uses a lot of air-conditioning to keep cool during the hot summer. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. This is an example of how people often use too much air-conditioning. Air-conditioning is now very common in many places. It shows how people can change the temperature. But, many buildings could stay cool in other ways. They could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls to keep out the heat. These ideas might seem simple, but they can help a lot and reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. People are interested in them again as we start a new millennium. A hundred years ago, sundials were important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches got better, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are interested in them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. Sundials are calm and romantic, and they remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I used to think china-painting was only for very skilled people. I once saw older women painting teacups with flowers at an arts and crafts show. They painted perfectly, and it seemed like they had been doing it for a long time. I wondered who would want to learn china-painting. Would beginners be good at it too? But when I visited a china-painting class, it was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint quickly like I had seen before."
CPE_47,"Title: The Wrong Country

Uncle found a cheap holiday package for Keith and Dawne. It included a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent told them they would be with a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. 

Instead of Venice, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland at the Edelweiss Hotel, Room 212. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they noticed people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they arrived, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. Keith thought there was an overnight stop not mentioned in the brochure. It was late, and they were tired, so they didn't question the hotel. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. 

Keith told the receptionist there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said they were booked for twelve nights in Switzerland. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help. 

A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels. She laughed and said they couldn't end up in a wildlife park by mistake. Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left to check, and the receptionist was gone too.

An old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, talked to Keith and Dawne. They said they slept well because of the lakeside air. Keith and Dawne realized they were on a holiday with elderly people, which was not what they wanted. They wanted to escape the demands of the elderly, as Uncle had suggested."
CPE_48,"**He Was a People Person**

American business leaders are learning from Ernest Shackleton, a famous explorer. Eluned Price reports.

Many people in Britain know about Sir Ernest Shackleton and his adventures. In America, he is becoming popular now. The Wall Street Journal called him ""an Antarctic explorer"" who was not well-known for a long time. But now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about his journey on the ship Endurance are being written, and a big exhibition is happening at the American Museum of Natural History. Columbia Tristar is also making a movie about his life.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a great example. They admire his leadership and communication skills. They even use the term ""speaking Shackleton"" to describe using his methods. Shackleton, with his warm sleeping bag and stove, is now a model for modern managers.

Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has used Shackleton as a role model for years. His company helps with communication during business problems, like when a factory has an accident or many workers lose their jobs. MacGregor says Shackleton is a good example because he was a strong leader and communicator. He made tough decisions, like turning back from the South Pole in 1908 to save his team.

In a crisis, people want a leader. Shackleton was always in charge. During his 1914 expedition, his ship Endurance was stuck in ice and eventually sank. Shackleton told his men they would be safe if they trusted him and did their best. He planned carefully, kept his team informed, and listened to their ideas.

Shackleton believed explorers need optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor says it's important to wait and not rush to fix problems. If a plan isn't working, don't be afraid to change it. Shackleton showed this by giving his gloves to a team member and sharing a biscuit when food was scarce.

Caroline Alexander, who wrote about Shackleton's expedition, says people today admire his bravery. Shackleton is seen as a true hero, showing qualities we miss in today's world."
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insect larvae inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long, thin middle finger to reach and scoop out the insects.

Scientists have been studying how the aye-aye finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and Annabelle. He wanted to know if they used their eyes to find insects. He gave them logs with holes. Some holes had mealworms, and some did not. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with mealworms, even without seeing any signs on the surface.

Dr. Erickson also tested if the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. He found that they did not need these clues. They could find mealworms even if they were dead and silent. The aye-ayes could sense the empty spaces inside the wood.

When looking for food, the aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and listens with its big ears. Dr. Erickson thinks the aye-aye uses echo-location, like a bat, to find hollow spaces. It might also hear insects moving when it taps.

The aye-aye is like a woodpecker, but there are also birds in Madagascar that look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is also like a squirrel because its teeth keep growing, and it can open nuts with its teeth and long finger."
CAE_19,"Title: 'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories often don't tell us everything. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they still don't show everything.

Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes people's life stories. She creates a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. Hannah got the idea when she talked to her family and realized that many stories from the past were disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But now I see that people have interesting lives and want to share them.""

People feel safe to be honest with Hannah. A 62-year-old man shared his life story, including painful parts like his divorce. He did it for his family, hoping they could learn something. But he hasn't let his children read it yet because it might hurt them. He thinks they should read it after he is gone.

Hannah notices that many people repeat patterns from their childhood. They often marry people their parents liked or do the opposite to rebel. Many people still feel upset about things that happened with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed.

Hannah listens to people's stories without judging. She writes down everything, and people can decide later if they want to remove anything. Most people want to be honest. These books are not for everyone to read; they are for family and close friends. They help people remember the past and feel connected to their ancestors.

Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these to write the life story, organizing the events and adding her own understanding. Modern technology helps her make the book look nice, with a special cover and title. The books are not cheap; they cost nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. Hannah gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the price stops many people from buying.

Hannah thought her books would be for more ordinary people, but most of her clients are wealthy and read magazines like Harpers & Queen. They are the kind of people who used to have their portraits painted for their family."

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has many copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over 600 sculptures, but none of them are real. They are all copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The museum is in a special building with good natural light. The good thing about these copies is that you can see sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums across Europe. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

The new Whewell Gallery has beautiful minerals and gems with labels explaining them.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**

This collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over 45 years. The university has its own plane at Cambridge Airport and takes photos all over Great Britain. The photos show the landscape and human activity from ancient times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. You cannot borrow the photos, but you can buy copies, which take about a month to make.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is a unique tourist attraction. You can make wall hangings by rubbing over 100 different brass plates from medieval tombs. The centre has made copies of the original plates so they can be preserved. Brass plates were used as memorials in medieval Europe, but many were destroyed. Most of the remaining plates are in Britain, and you can see many examples at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**

I have had small children in my life for 35 years, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I fed the baby, and for me, that is what being a father is about. I am lucky because my children and I love the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This makes us close, especially now that they are older, and I am more like a friend than a father. I don't believe in hitting children. I have slapped my children in anger, but I don't think it's right. I try to be there for them if they need me, but I let them call me. I don't want to make them feel guilty by asking why they haven't called. My parents did that to me, and I don't want to do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was about 25 when my children were born. I found the responsibilities hard, but they also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new music, clothes, and youth culture, which helped me in my job. I missed some things when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, because I was busy with work. But now, I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along with our friends and come to parties and work events with us. I think they like that my job is interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born when I was about to start a big job in politics. My wife and I wanted to make time for our children, but as I got busier, it became hard. I try to only have meetings on weekends where my kids can come with me. This way, they know what I do, and they don't feel like I am gone. I see more politicians bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want to include our children in our lives more.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when my children, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I tried hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, so the kids could visit both of us easily. But I think it was confusing for them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated them like adults too soon. Kate said we were too easygoing. I wish I had been more organized. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready to have kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice house. We thought, ""Why keep buying things when we could have a child?"" Having my daughter Betty made me think about who I am. You feel special when you have a child, but you also become just another parent. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her smile makes it all better. A baby's smile can make anyone happy."

CAE_46,"Title: Science and Weightlessness

Journalist Tom Mumford joined students on a special flight to test their science ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, the plane looked normal. It was a Boeing KC-135, made in 1964, similar to a Boeing 707. But inside, it was different. The plane had a long white tunnel with few windows and lights on the walls. Most seats were removed, except a few at the back where 13 students from Europe and America sat. They had worked hard for a year to win a place on this flight, offered by the European Space Agency. The students had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas got a spot on this special flight, which was like a wild roller-coaster ride.

For two hours, the plane flew up and down like a big bird. At the top of each curve, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane went higher on its own before falling back to Earth. During these moments, everything inside the plane became weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight started smoothly, but soon the plane climbed steeply. The engines were loud, and the students felt the blood rush from their heads. Then, the engines stopped, and they felt weightless. For 20 seconds, they floated around the cabin. It was hard to tell which way was up or down.

After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane out of the dive. Gravity returned, and some students landed hard. There were 30 curves in total, giving the students 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments.

The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They used a device to turn the cat right-side up. A German team looked at how metal joins in space, which is important for building space stations. Another team from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films. These sails could use the sun's energy like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours, the students felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. One student said, ""It was unforgettable. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Made a Connection to New Zealand**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology."" He talks about a special time in his life when he didn't have any summers. Every summer in England, he went to New Zealand, which was winter there. So, he had nine winters in a row. He liked this because he enjoys winter.

His parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land in New Zealand for him and his siblings. His mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, they would always have a connection to New Zealand, where their father grew up. They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland, in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was okay for planting trees.

Jonathon loved the idea because he was interested in land. He had worked in Australia on sheep farms and liked farming jobs. He started planting trees in 1968, and by 1972, he and his siblings had planted trees on all 70 acres.

In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. Even though it was wet and cold, Jonathon remembers it as a happy time. Every morning, he got ready to plant trees, even though his clothes were wet from the day before. He worked with an experienced tree-planter, which helped him learn.

Planting trees was hard work. He carried a bag full of trees and had to plant them in straight lines. He enjoyed the physical work and got very fit. After a while, he got used to the rhythm of planting: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, putting the tree in, and moving on.

While planting, he had time to think about life and nature. These thoughts became important to him later. He has visited New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow. He feels a strong connection to the land and worries when he hears about bad weather in New Zealand.

In 1984, he took time off from teaching to go back to New Zealand alone. He stayed in a small cabin on the tree farm and wrote his first book, ""Seeing Green."" He wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. He feels a strong bond with that place, as it connects him to the earth."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" I thought when a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset, where we care for orphaned animals. Inside the box, I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky-colored eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between January and March and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger.

These cubs were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. The mother was dead, and the cubs were still with her. They were healthy but cold and crying. After cleaning them, I put them by the stove in our kitchen to keep warm. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. I fed them with a syringe and used a warm cloth to clean them, like their mother would. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Soon, they started drinking from a bottle and moving around a bit.

Three weeks later, Willow seemed tired but was still eating. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. When feeding animals, it's important not to let them drink too fast, or liquid can go into their lungs. This happened to Willow, and he got sick.

I was sad but continued caring for the others. Then, a local farmer brought me another male cub, also named Willow. He was cold and hungry, and his mother had left him. Willow II was hard to feed. I had to move the bottle around to get him to drink. Eventually, he learned to eat sausages, and then other foods.

By five months, the cubs were eating cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were lucky because the summer was hot, and finding earthworms was hard.

By August, the cubs became more active at night. We often walked through the orchard, and they played and chased each other. They even included us in their games. I learned to avoid their playful bites, but Derek sometimes got caught.

During our walks, I saw other badgers in our field. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive to others. We were warned they might harm our cubs, so we made their pen more secure.

The local press took pictures of us with the badgers, and we started a project to build a home for them on the farm. With help, we designed a sett with tunnels and a viewing area. The badgers explored it and eventually moved in. The cost was high, but a local bus company and other businesses helped.

Now, the badgers have their own home. I don't walk with them as much because they are active late at night. Primrose has joined another group, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before going off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy here."
CAE_67,"Text: 'Looking for True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass changes. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But one of his important achievements was to study 'compass variations' during his sea trips on the ship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors could not correct their compasses and find their way across the oceans. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the Atlantic Ocean. The trip stopped early because of problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these trips, Halley published a map in 1701 showing compass variations in the oceans. This map was very useful to sailors for over a hundred years until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate. Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. 'Halley had an amazing life,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.' Dr. Clark believes that recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. They will make the same measurements Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the current model of Earth's magnetic field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our trip, we can use global positioning satellites to find true north.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements around the world. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill any gaps in the satellite's data over the Atlantic Ocean. It is important to remember how significant Halley's journey was. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian made a naval captain to study declination. Does Dr. Clark have the skills to make his journey a success? He spent two years in Antarctica, worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, and has already sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with four different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I am ready to spend eight months on this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his interesting life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER**

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peacocks, called hens. This behavior puzzled Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, because he wondered why peacocks have such big, fancy tails in a world where animals need to be strong and fast to survive.

Darwin thought animals change over time through a process called evolution. He believed that animals best suited to their environment survive and have babies. But he was confused about the peacock's tail because it seemed to be a disadvantage. So, he suggested another idea called ""sexual selection,"" where females choose mates based on beauty.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought that if hens chose peacocks with the best tails, it must mean those peacocks had some hidden quality that helped them survive.

Today, scientists like Marion Petrie are studying peacocks at Whipsnade to find out if hens really choose the males with the best tails and if those males have other good qualities. They have noticed that hens prefer peacocks with more eye-spots on their tails, which means longer tails. But they are still trying to find out if these peacocks are better in other ways, like being healthier.

Another scientist, William Hamilton, suggested that showy male birds might be healthier because they have fewer parasites. But this is hard to test with the peacocks at Whipsnade.

Marion Petrie is also looking at the children of attractive and unattractive peacocks to see if the attractive ones have healthier or faster-growing babies.

Finally, a mathematician named R A Fisher had an idea called ""Fisher's Runaway."" He thought that if females start choosing males with slightly better tails, over time, this preference could lead to peacocks having very long tails. This idea supports Darwin's thought that females might choose beauty just for beauty's sake."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with new technology. Most of these boats are based on designs from 25 years ago. My boat, however, is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic dreamer, but I am not sure about that. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but modern technology helped make it better.

Modern technology is important in boat design and building, but it can sometimes make sailing too easy. Many people go to sea to experience the challenges of sailing. I think it's important for boats to have some comforts, like a stove for warmth and a good place to sleep. But if everything on the boat is automatic, it takes away from the experience. For example, setting and taking down sails should be part of a sailor's life. Also, moving the steering position to the middle of the boat just to have a bigger cabin is not a good idea. A boat should feel like a boat, not a house on water.

I once had a boat called Hirta, which I sailed around Britain for a TV race. The previous owner said it had comfort but no luxury. Hirta had heavy sails and no modern conveniences like electricity or a fridge, but it was the nicest boat I ever sailed. However, old boats need a lot of care. After I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a new boat I liked, so I decided to build one myself.

The Westerman, my new boat, has been great. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew it on a napkin before using a computer. He also made a model of the boat, like in the old days. We worked together to make the design perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won many races. It looks timeless and is very comfortable. It was designed as a sailing boat first, without thinking about furniture. This is the traditional way, and it works well. The boat is made of wood treated with a special glue, so it is waterproof like a fiberglass boat but feels like a real wooden boat."

I was called a ""patient,"" which was strange because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem during my check-up and helped me with it. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry and got a headache on the second day. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit with yogurt. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. The extra treatments are not too expensive. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys Manor is not a health farm. It is a nice old manor with log fires and a big lounge. The food is very tasty, but not for people counting calories. There is a gym and a pool to help burn calories. They have a spa bath, steam room, and treatment rooms. There is also a sports injury clinic. I got advice for my shoulder injury. Careys is comfortable and luxurious. You can also explore the countryside around it. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens. The restaurant, Waldo's, has amazing food. I enjoyed a wonderful meal and then used the gym to burn some calories. I also had a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty options if you want them. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is delicious but has many calories. The aromatherapy massage is also great. I felt very relaxed and had a good night's sleep. The place is modern and well-run. There are many therapists and beauty rooms. They offer treatments like manicures, pedicures, and facials. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to friends and families. I would like to visit once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,"**Natural Talents**

Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means that the things that make us different from animals are new in our history. Our ability to make art and do other human things comes from a small part of our genes. 

Scientists have found that many things we thought only humans could do, animals can do too. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. 

The main difference between humans and animals might be art. But our ancestors did not make art for a long time. The first clear human art, like cave paintings and statues, appeared about 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons. 

People say human art is different because it is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinctive. 

1. **Not Useful**: Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art does not help us survive or have children. Birdsong, for example, helps birds find mates and protect their area. 

2. **Made for Beauty**: Humans make art for pleasure. We do not know if birds enjoy their songs, but they sing mostly during mating season, so it might not be for pleasure.

3. **Learned, Not Instinctive**: Human art styles are learned. People in different places have different art styles, like songs in Tokyo and Paris. Birds, however, are born knowing their songs. 

Human art changes quickly. For example, paintings from the 20th century look different from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often tell when and who painted a picture. But sometimes, they might mistake art by chimpanzees, like Congo and Betsy, for human art. Congo and Betsy were chimpanzees who painted for fun. Their art was shown in a London gallery in 1957, and many paintings were sold. 

These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal activities is not always clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee art was not made for a specific purpose but for enjoyment. Some human art, even famous pieces, was also made for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"Title: A Big Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story. 

There are not many big adventures or heroes left today. In the past, children's stories often had brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance. Today, we don't see many people like that in stories or real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore led a team across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored places on earth. The desert's name means 'once entered you never come out', and local people call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home.

The team had four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were actually truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous for the team.

They traveled 1,200 kilometers across the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a book about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He started the expedition for fun and to learn more about himself. 'I always thought I would stay in the Army. But I wanted to see who I really was outside of it. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was worried because nobody had done that route before. We went into it without knowing what to expect. It took us 59 days to cross, and the desert was kind to us.'

The team faced many problems: illness, very hot and cold temperatures, thirst, and losing some of their water. 'But', Blackmore says, 'when we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some. We didn't have the desert's famous sandstorms. And we didn't face the very cold weather that could have stopped us. But we had many challenges. The sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the camels, which sometimes fell on us.'

'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. No planes flew over us. Once we were in the desert, we were alone. I knew I was mentally strong, but I was scared about my physical strength. On the first day, we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot we couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" I was very scared.'

Towards the end, he said, 'When you've walked 1,000 kilometers, you don't give up. We were very thin but strong. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.'

In the book, Blackmore talks about lying in the desert, looking at the moon, and thinking of his family. He says, 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace. When I doubt myself, I think of the desert and how we succeeded. I am proud of that expedition. But my family and our happiness are more important.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I miss the challenge and the open spaces. We had a strong purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of everyday life.'"
CAE_18,"Susan Harr was feeling overwhelmed by technology, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and save time. But Susan started to think that maybe we rely too much on technology. She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which was expensive to fix. This made her question if gadgets are worth the cost and trouble.

Susan began to let her household gadgets stop working naturally. She wondered if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets. When her sewing machine started making strange noises, she decided to stop using it. Now, she sews by hand and enjoys it. She can take her sewing anywhere and doesn't have to listen to a noisy machine.

There are some gadgets Susan still likes, like the washing machine. But she found joy in getting rid of others, like the color TV. Now, her family spends more time walking the dog, reading, and talking. Susan enjoys sewing by hand, listening to the radio, and watching TV while sewing. She finds it relaxing and satisfying to see her work improve.

Susan realized that doing things by hand slows down life and makes it more enjoyable. She even enjoys washing dishes by hand and daydreaming. Now, she looks around her house and wonders if they really need things like the freezer, microwave, or electric lights. She thinks they could save money by using fewer gadgets."
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt visits him at his workshop in East London. When she arrives, Charles seems busy and in a hurry. His workshop is full of half-made furniture and different colored wood. Charles has been making furniture for ten years and is well-known for his work. He always has many orders, even though he does not advertise. People know that if they want good furniture, they should go to him.

Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes simple and beautiful furniture is rare. Charles says there are not many real cabinet-makers anymore. He is not happy with some modern furniture because it is not well-made. He does not like mass-produced furniture and wants everything to be perfect. This is why he is successful.

Charles is confident in his skills. He says he has a natural ability to make things. He learned his craft by asking questions and learning on his own. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some clients come back many times. He likes clients who know what they want, but sometimes they can be difficult.

Charles respects other good craftsmen and admits there are people better than him. He criticizes those who take too long to make one piece of furniture and those who try to make fashion statements with their work. He believes furniture should be useful, not just for show.

Charles is confident but not pretentious. As Joanna leaves, he humbly says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three ideas about why we sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This means sleep is very important. But, we are not sure exactly why we need sleep. Scientists have three main ideas about this. The first idea is that sleep helps our body stay healthy. When we sleep, our body fixes any problems from the day and makes us ready for the next day. The second idea is that sleep helps us learn. It says that when we sleep, we think about what we learned during the day. Without sleep, we might not learn well. The third idea is about energy. It says we need sleep to get more energy for the next day, like charging a battery.'"
CAE_31,"**Eccentrics**

An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own little habits. For example, some people love entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is about being unique. 

Inside us, there are two forces. One is called individualism, which means being different. The other is conformity, which means being like everyone else. Most people want to be accepted and loved, so they choose conformity. They want to fit in with others rather than stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find others like them. They form clubs and have meetings to share their interests. They feel better when they are with others who understand them.

We all feel a pull between being unique and fitting in. Sometimes, we want to show we are different. For example, someone might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me."" 

Anyone can choose to be more individual. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said that when you follow your true feelings and don't give up, you might surprise people. But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric.

When a pop singer wears strange clothes to get attention, or a person makes shocking comments to be noticed, they are not eccentric. If they keep doing these things until it becomes normal for them, then they might be eccentric. 

True eccentrics do not try to be different; they just are. They do not care what others think. They do what they do because it is who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,"Natural Books

We asked four nature experts to tell us about the wildlife book that influenced them the most.

A. Geoffrey Lean
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman, is the most important. She was at the center of environmental issues in post-war Europe. Her book, The Home of Man, is about the fast growth of cities and the need for sustainable development. It is the best book I have read on this topic.

B. Linda Bennett
When I read Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a gull colony. This book explains how animals communicate. After reading it, watching a gull colony becomes more interesting. You can see how they interact and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with artist Eric Ennion, whose paintings show bird behavior with just a few lines and colors.

C. Lee Durrell
My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a great husband and a career in conservation. I read it while researching animal sounds in Madagascar. The book made me feel better during tough times. It shows animals and people living together happily. It reminds us that all living things are connected, like a family.

D. Bruce Pearson
I found The Shell Bird Book by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. The book's 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion caught my attention. I already liked birdwatching and sketching birds. This book had more to offer, with chapters on bird migration and birds in music, literature, and art. It helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature is as important as a scientific one. This book opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,"**Do Reviews Help Sell Books?**

We talked to five big British publishers to find out if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. When people were asked why they bought a book, most said it was because of reviews. Both authors and publishers feel bad if there are no reviews. But publishers don't mind bad reviews as much because any review can make people curious to read the book. Publishers like reviews that agree with their own thoughts about the book.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks still don't get enough attention. Reviews help people know about a book and can increase sales, especially if many reviews are positive.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for us because we publish books by authors who are not very famous. We don't advertise much, so we need reviews to help sell our books. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest opinions. Reviews can help a book become popular, but they need to work with other things like word-of-mouth and good marketing.

**Publisher D**  
In the US, a review in the New York Times can make a book very popular. In Britain, it's different. Sometimes, even with great reviews, it takes a long time for people to start reading a writer's work. Some books sell well even without reviews. It's hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction reviews often talk more about the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell well because people felt they knew the book from the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's more about the review's style and originality that makes people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,"Text: 'WEATHERVANE MAKER Making weathervanes is a very old skill, starting in early Egyptian times. Today, Graham Smith keeps this craft alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates special designs for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique and personal item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's work or hobbies.' This is different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. 'I saw that I could make many different designs,' he says. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes. He had worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change roles. Liz went to work as an architectural assistant, and Graham stayed home to take care of the children and start the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is fun and creative,' he says. 'I really like designing.' Graham has made over 100 original designs. He works with great detail and always checks with the customer before cutting the design. Graham also keeps many traditional designs because they are popular too. 'People like handmade things,' Graham says. 'They like to have something a little different.' Graham does not want to expand his business. He wants to keep it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique designs, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost real,' he says. 'For many years, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want something special for their homes. This helps crafts like mine.' Graham is very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'The price,' he says, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can make a special gift.'"
CAE_68,"Title: Beginner's Luck

Before it was even published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about what inspired him and his success.

At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans. He was a screenwriter and producer, but a movie project he was working on suddenly failed. He was worried because he hadn't made any money in two years, and the bank was getting upset with him. Most people would have looked for a job, but Evans decided to do something different. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel.

The idea for the story came from a farrier (a person who shoes horses) he met in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a horse that became wild for no reason. Its owners were worried until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" Evans was fascinated by this story.

He started to learn more about horse whisperers, thinking he would write a movie script. But after his movie project failed, he decided to write a book instead. He traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses.

During this time, Evans felt alone and worried about his future. He had tried for ten years to succeed in the film industry, but now he was in debt and worried about his family. By August, he had written half of the book and showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was good and said Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts and support his family.

In October, Evans sent the first part of his book and a summary to seven publishers. Soon, his agent told him that someone offered $75,000 for the book. Evans was surprised. In a week, the book was sold for record amounts: $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. Hollywood studios also wanted to make a movie from it.

Evans was amazed by the success. He decided not to write the movie script for ""The Horse Whisperer"" because he didn't want to lose control over his story. He wanted to stay involved but not too closely. The success of his book also brought new interest in his old movie project, but he was not sure if he wanted to continue with it. He thought it might be better to write another novel."

Bobby won the first game, and it was very good. But Bobby is not the same as he was in 1972. He is 49 years old and not in practice. Boris Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in 20 years. Bobby Fischer made chess popular, and now it is more professional. Today, winning is the most important thing. In chess, you need strong nerves and energy, not just a smart mind. The game is very stressful. Players use a chess clock to make sure they play fast enough. If they don't, they lose the game. Now, games are longer and have no breaks. Young players have an advantage. In the last 30 years, each new world champion is younger than the one before. Eight of the top ten players in the world are under 30. Chess is also different because of computers. Players use computers to study their opponents' games. A small computer can have one million chess games. Before a match, players prepare a lot. The start of a chess game is very important. Being ready for the opening moves can help you win. There are more good chess players now than ever before. Many grandmasters play for small prizes all over the world. To win, you need to be strong in body and mind. A game can last up to eight hours. Players must focus all the time. If they lose focus, they can lose the game. The chess clock makes the game even more tense. At the end of the game, players have only seconds to make moves. They must move fast and press the clock quickly. This is not for people who think slowly. It is a fight where nerves and the will to win are important. Losing is very hard for top players. Winning feels great and helps them recover. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess competitions last 9-11 days, with games every day. There are tournaments all year. World championship matches are even harder. In 1984, Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov played in Moscow. They had to stop because they were too tired. Karpov lost a lot of weight. Can Bobby Fischer win again? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This made it strange when he left chess in 1972. But it made him famous. If he came back for money, he will get a lot. If he came back to show he is the best, losing could be very sad for him.'"

Simon Pegg, 28, studied drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon worked hard, even performing in comedy clubs while at university. He realized he preferred comedy over serious acting. He says, ""People think comedy is the hardest job, but it's not. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" Simon has worked with the comedy group Funny Business and has a good relationship with Steve Coogan.

CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four writers talk about international volunteer work.

**A.** Volunteer tourists often help build homes or schools. They pay a lot of money to do this work. If they gave this money directly to the local community, it could pay for more workers than one volunteer can do. This is true for gap year students who do not need special skills. Some studies question if gap year volunteering is really to help others or to improve the volunteer's career. However, these projects can help volunteers learn to act kindly and help those in need in the future.

**B.** Volunteering can help people understand each other better, solve problems, and join global groups. It can create international friendships. This can be good for both volunteers and the communities they help. But if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, it might help them more than the communities. These volunteers might use the experience to advance their careers, while the communities do not get much benefit.

**C.** Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as charity from rich countries or a way for volunteers to improve themselves. But it can also help share skills and knowledge between volunteers and communities. Volunteering can make people aware of poverty and unfairness in the world and encourage them to fight these issues.

**D.** Volunteer tourism is about helping others. It seems good because it is personal and not controlled by big governments or businesses. But it can also ignore the need for big changes in poor communities. Some people think volunteer tourism is just simple charity. But when it is called sustainable development, it can be misleading. It might not address the real problems of poverty and inequality in the world."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them wake up. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios.

One model has a 'dual alarm function.' I thought it would let you snooze and then wake up again, but it actually lets you set two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model also has a cassette player, which is nice because you can listen to your own tapes. The radio quality is good, but it's big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn't work.

Another model was the best-looking and the overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, even though the clock sometimes got stuck at 16:00. It has a nice digital display and a big snooze button. It also has a self-power back-up, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out. But it was hard to set up.

One model has a built-in lamp, but Tom Granger thought it was poorly made. The lamp is hard to use, and the clock was difficult to set. The radio was also hard to tune, and the buzzer was very loud. This model is popular with young people because of its bright colors.

Another model was easy to set up without reading the instructions. It has a traditional design, but the alarm can be off by 10 minutes. Paul Bridges thought it was too complicated and not very useful.

The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found more reliable. The radio quality was okay, and the buzzer worked well, waking me up quickly."
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many places around the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are in danger. This helps protect them because their spines stick out. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They are lighter and might try to run away from danger first. They roll into a ball only if they have to. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, which means they sleep for a long time in winter. But not all of them do this. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

Jill loves skiing. She says it feels great to fly through the air, but it can also be scary. Sometimes the weather is bad, but she keeps going. Skiing takes a lot of time, so she doesn't have much time for friends. There are six men and three women on her team, and they all compete together.

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

Caroline started cycling two years ago when she borrowed a bike for a charity race. She won the race even though she had never cycled before! Now she is a professional cyclist and trains a lot. She worries people might think she is successful because of her looks, not her skills. Her boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time she needs to train.

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

Annabel says rowing is hard for girls to start because not many schools offer it. Most girls start rowing when they are older, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Coaches often change, so the team is not very organized. But Annabel loves rowing and staying fit.

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

Ffyona dreamed of walking around the world when she was 13. She found Britain too small and safe. Walking across Australia was very hard for her, with long days and little sleep. She had many blisters but still got the record. She needed to finish because her sponsorship money was running out. People often think women might fail, so it's harder for them to get sponsors.

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

Lisa says some men have big egos when driving. They don't like it when she does well. Racing is tough, and she doesn't earn much money. Women have been racing for a long time, but they were seen as unusual. Now, more women are racing every year. Lisa loves trying to make the perfect lap.

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

Alison wakes up early to swim three times a week. She also cycles and runs. Sometimes she falls asleep at her desk because she is so tired. Racing is hard, but she enjoys it because it keeps her fit and is social. Men and women often race together, but the media mostly talks about the men's races. The prize money for women is also less, but they are working to change that."
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was 18 years old. Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van before starting university. He ran out of money and got a job painting boats in Cannes, France. One day, while eating at a restaurant, he saw Picasso, who was 78 years old, having lunch with his wife and friends.

Picasso was a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him. Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard went to Picasso and asked him to sign his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed it and even drew a little picture on the page.

Richard was very happy and started talking to Picasso. Since Picasso didn't speak much English, an American woman at the table helped translate. Richard told Picasso how much he loved art and admired his work.

Richard's friend suggested he draw a portrait of Picasso. Richard went back to Picasso's table and started drawing him. Picasso made funny faces and gestures, making it hard for Richard to draw. But eventually, Picasso sat still, and Richard could finish his drawing.

Picasso then wanted to see the drawing. Richard was shy but showed it to him. Picasso liked it and decided to draw something on the same page. In a few quick strokes, Picasso drew a funny face next to Richard's drawing.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso said he had already signed once. Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It was a special moment for him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Buy More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some ways they do it:

**A. Freshness Image**
Supermarkets know people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to look fresh. They might also have a bakery inside, so you smell fresh bread. The store might use green colors because green makes people think of fresh things. Most of what they sell, like frozen foods, is not fresh, but the store looks fresh.

**B. Product Placement**
Where products are placed in a store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to know where people pick items the most. They put expensive or fast-selling products there. Shelves at eye level are popular because people see them first. Special offers in big bins attract people who love bargains. Stores also put things that go together, like salad dressings near salads.

**C. Spreading Staples**
Supermarkets put basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, you pass other things that might tempt you. Stores put popular items far from the entrance too, so you see other products while looking for them.

**D. Less is More**
Some stores, like Next, show fewer items to look special. They make it seem like their clothes are exclusive, even though they are not. This is because of good store design.

**E. Total Price Temptation**
People care more about the total bill than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some things cheap to get you in the store. They buy in large amounts to get discounts from manufacturers.

**F. Price Tags Matter**
In chain stores, people notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference. It also helps reduce theft because staff have to ring up the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting Tricks**
Stores use lighting carefully. Chain stores use natural light so clothes look the same as outside. Supermarkets use special lights to make fruits and vegetables look better.

**H. Walking Paths**
Stores use different carpets to guide you. One type of carpet is for walking paths, and another is for sales areas. This guides you through the store. Some stores use wood or marble for paths to make you walk onto the carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of delicious food. This makes you want to buy if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets use video trolleys. These trolleys show ads for products as you shop. They are for people who buy on impulse and can increase sales by 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing paths in Britain and the Alps and has written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about it in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, Chris was working on a book about adventure after the war. He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to go sailing. Chris could teach Robin some climbing, and Robin could teach Chris some sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed and then stopped the boat. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went to the shore to climb. The climb was hard, but Robin did well. Chris showed Robin how to climb down safely, and Robin did it using his own way.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they use their skills together on a trip to Greenland. Chris was impressed by Robin as a leader. Usually, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions. Chris found sailing boring and difficult because he likes being on land. Robin, on the other hand, enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt he wasn't needed and found it hard to be on a small boat with six people.

When they reached Greenland, Chris led the climbing part of the trip. He was worried about keeping Robin safe while climbing. They tried to climb Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, but it was very hard. They climbed for 24 hours and were very tired. Robin trusted Chris and followed him, even when they had to turn back. Robin was also worried about the boat, but he wanted to try climbing the mountain again.

On the way home, there was a small problem between Chris and Robin. Chris was supposed to take a turn watching the boat at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him up. Chris thought Robin didn't trust him, but Robin explained that wasn't true. By the end of the Greenland trip, Chris learned that Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples for a very long time. In ancient times, people in Britain and around Swiss and Italian lakes ate wild apples. These apples were small and not like the ones we eat today. They were called 'windings' in Ancient Britain.

**Apples in Britain (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain, including how to make cider. The Normans, who came after the Romans, introduced new apple types that grew better in Britain. Monks in Britain worked on creating new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of many apples we have today.

**Popular Apples (1200)**  
In the 13th century, some apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a favorite dessert apple, and the Costard was used for cooking. However, during tough times like droughts and the Black Death, fewer apples were grown, and more were imported. In the 16th century, King Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn more about growing apples. Harris brought back new apple types, including the famous Pippins, and started a modern orchard in Kent.

**Apples Around the World (1750)**  
By the 17th century, apples were so loved in Britain that settlers took them to new places like Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. In America, Johnny Appleseed was famous for planting apple trees across many states.

**New Apple Varieties (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree and named the apple 'Hawkey'. It was later called 'Delicious' and became very popular. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith discovered a new green apple, which became known as the 'Granny Smith'. She found the tree growing from discarded fruit and made it famous worldwide.

**Modern Apple Growing (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from just a few types, chosen for their looks and ability to travel well, not for taste. This has led to less variety in apples. In the UK, some gardeners keep old apple types alive, but many have been lost in the US. People now want more variety in apples, and it's important to protect different types of apples for the future."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best in the 10,000-meter race. Richard visited a training camp in Kenya. This camp is in a place called Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya. Mount Kenya is a tall mountain with ice on top. Richard has been coming to Kenya for three years to train in the high mountains. But he never trained with Kenyan runners before. On his fourth trip, he decided to change this. He ran his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This camp is where the best Kenyan runners get ready for big races. Richard was invited by the coach because he did well in a world race, finishing fifth. Training at high places helps runners because it makes their bodies better at using oxygen. This is one reason why Kenyan runners are so good. Richard's first race in Africa was in Nairobi. It was the first international race in Africa. Many runners finished before him, and most of them were Kenyan. Richard learned that Kenyan runners are successful not just because of the high altitude. They have a simple way of living and training. They enjoy running and competing. At the training camp, Richard saw how the Kenyan runners train. The camp is at St Mark's College, high up on Mount Kenya. The camp is simple, with few comforts. The runners live with college students and share rooms. They train three times a day: an easy run in the morning, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they go to a stream to wash. Richard learned that Kenyan success is not just about genetics or altitude. It is also about their simple lifestyle, hard training, and love for running. These might be the real reasons why Kenyan runners are so successful."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is having a hard time. It's not just because of the bad economy. Advertising started to drop in 1989, even before the economy got worse. The problem is bigger and affects the whole world. Advertising hasn't kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now there are many brands and media, and markets are smaller. Big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they often don't. This is where advertising is going wrong.

Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For things like cars, you might buy one every three years, and many people get cars from their jobs. You don't buy many clothes, and most are not advertised brands. Even with candy, medicine, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

There are 32,500 advertised brands, but most people buy only 400 of them. This means 96% of advertising might be wasted. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 ads. This means 94% of ads might be wasted. People think they don't pay attention to ads, but everyone sees many ads they don't buy from.

Advertising has to reach many people to find the few who will buy. It's a cheap way to talk to many people, even if it's expensive. Smart targeting can help reduce waste, but advertisers can't know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail doesn't get a 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every customer. If advertisers knew who would respond, they wouldn't need media.

If an advertiser gets one million new customers, that's good. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million new customers. Any campaign that gets 2% of the population is very successful. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message better than before."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an old cathedral with 'green' men carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', made by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their waste into garden compost, and heat their house with heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with their three children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and is 300 yards from the Minster. It matches the town's old buildings and was approved by planners even though it is in a protected area. The house is very quiet because it is super-insulated with special windows. Inside, you must take off your shoes. It is a sunny day, and the conservatory warms the air for the house. Vale opens windows to let in air because the house is very airtight. Even the cats have their own special door. The Vales, who teach architecture, cared about the environment before it was popular. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed a house with no carbon dioxide emissions and no mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to keep water clean. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't use a dishwasher because they don't want to use strong detergents. They wanted to show that you can have an environmentally-friendly house without living in the dark. The house looks old-fashioned, but it is modern inside. The Vales pay no water bills and use very little electricity. Soon, they will have solar panels to make even more electricity. The house will use electricity from the mains for cooking, but it will also make extra electricity. They have a small wood stove for very cold days. In winter, the house stays warm because there are no draughts. The house is simple and low-tech, with parts from local builders. It was cheap to build, costing the same as low-cost housing. Big building companies do not like this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man, like a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies in a garden, he believed they were real proof that fairies existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural things. In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them among flowers. The photos are very pretty. But this simple trick shows that a basic idea about photography, that the camera cannot lie, is not true. Cameras can lie, and they always could. Today, we use computer programs to change our digital photos, and it is not true that photography was ever completely honest. From the start, when cameras began taking pictures of reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Iron has always been important to people, and blacksmiths, who work with iron, have been seen as more than just workers. Before machines were common, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The fancy metal designs in French and Belgian buildings were also made by skilled blacksmiths.

By the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain. Big factories did not need them anymore, and new buildings did not use pretty iron designs. But in the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become popular again because people are more interested in decorative buildings and creative interior design. However, many iron products still look old-fashioned, like 'classical' or 'Victorian-style' gates and balconies. In trendy stores, you often see rusty candlesticks with decorations.

Luckily, there are new ideas, and some events are promoting blacksmithing. One event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says we might be starting a new Iron Age. Power tools now help blacksmiths work more easily, allowing them to create art with metal. About 250 items are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most money goes to the makers, but some helps promote good ironwork.

Dawson made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade for the show. He says his style is like drawing with metal. Many artists love working with iron because it is soft when hot but hard when cold. Susan May, a jeweler, finds it magical. Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles inspired by castles in horror films. She likes that steel feels permanent.

Iron has given people visual pleasure and a sense of safety. It will likely be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"Title: The Day I Stopped Smoking

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It was strange to me too.

I stopped smoking after a session that mixed group therapy and hypnotherapy. This happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who were against smoking. Also, I was healthy and didn't have any problems like coughing. I even got over colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On a normal Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" in Birmingham. I was there to write an article about other people trying to quit smoking. I told them, ""I won't try to stop smoking because I'm here to write, not to quit."" I thought I was being fair. I enjoyed smoking and it made me happy.

During the session, we were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted. The room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when they told us to smoke, I didn't really want to, and neither did the others. The messages about stopping smoking made sense to me. The idea of not smoking started to feel good. It was a secret feeling just for me. Could I do more things if I stopped smoking?

In many ways, it was easy to stop. The desire for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two. I only felt it for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I needed cigarettes to meet deadlines, but I was wrong.

Surprisingly, the hardest part was being at home on weekend mornings. I realized smoking was something I did when I was bored. Having a cigarette was like an activity. Yes, I miss smoking, but not too much. Now, I have to get used to doing things without smoking, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but not many people in Britain know her name. Georgina Ferry, who is writing a book about Hodgkin, thinks she should be famous. Hodgkin was a great scientist who studied crystals and made important discoveries about penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin. She won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964.

Hodgkin's life was interesting. She lived through big changes in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and the spread of science around the world. She also had a family, with three children and a husband who was often away for his work as a historian.

Many people think that scientists' lives are not as exciting as those of artists or writers. This is why there are not many books about scientists. But this is changing. More books now show scientists as real people with personal lives, like Richard Feynman's funny book about his life.

Some scientists, like Richard Dawkins and Steve Jones, are now seen on TV, which helps people see them as normal people. This is important because it can make young people more interested in science.

Understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. It just needs effort. It is important to know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin because they have given us a lot of knowledge and discoveries."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Special Skill

Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and air hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

This skill is called dowsing. It is like having a 'sixth sense' to find water, minerals, or lost things underground. Some people think it works because everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more. Dowsers, like Margaret, can feel these vibrations. Some say they can even smell water.

Margaret and her husband have been very busy in recent years because of droughts. They have a long waiting list. Most of their customers are farmers with dry wells. Some customers have holiday homes far from water pipes. Others are building golf courses and need water.

Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and not near any waste. The water is in cracks in hard rock. They also need electricity to pump the water, so the well should be near power lines.

To find water, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She moves the pendulum over the map, and it swings where there is water. Then she walks over the land with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. The stick helps her find the exact spot to drill. Her husband checks the same area. If they agree, they drill. If not, they keep looking.

Margaret's skill is not common, but it is very useful. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment.' This skill helps her family run their well-drilling business successfully."

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different. We helped four people do this. Read their stories.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda is 23 years old and has two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.

Amanda had never been in a place like the restaurant before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. She had to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. It was hard, and she dropped the drinks on the floor. The other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, there was a line of people waiting to come in. Amanda was nervous about remembering orders, but everything was done by computer. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to get used to. She had to keep saying ""Pardon?"" because she couldn't hear the customers.

By 5 pm, Amanda was very tired and wanted to rest her feet. She was surprised when a waitress said it was a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized waitressing is hard work. She thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be friendly and calm. She was happy to go back to her children. It seemed easy after waitressing!

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for the day. She thought she could handle Amanda's cheeky daughters, but it was harder than she expected.

After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls. She took Sophie to school and Katie to nursery. She thought she would have some free time, but Amanda left a note with chores to do.

Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then picked up Sophie. The girls were full of energy and played loudly. Cindy tried to stay calm, thinking they would get tired, but they didn't. She finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up.

Cindy found looking after children very tiring. You don't have time for yourself, and the responsibility is big. But she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary is 42 and runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher.

On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was nervous about what to wear to school. At assembly, she hoped she didn't stand out.

Rosemary helped with a maths class and a nature project. By lunchtime, she was tired but only had five minutes to eat. She attended a meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, there was a reading lesson and a French lesson. The children wanted to practice French with her, which was fun.

The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Teachers have more holidays, but Rosemary prefers farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at the farm at 8:30 am. Rosemary had already been working for three hours! The farm has 100 cows, 15 calves, and 800 sheep. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream.

Hilary spent the morning in the ice cream shop, bottling milk and packing ice cream. She wanted to taste the ice cream but didn't.

At lunchtime, Hilary checked the sheep. She helped a sheep that had fallen over. If sheep stay down too long, they can die. After feeding the calves, she started milking the cows. It took two and a half hours, and Rosemary does this twice a day, every day.

Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The hardest part of farming is not being able to take time off. Rosemary only gets about three days of holiday a year. Farming seems nice, but it's hard work, and the income is not steady."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many famous musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is one of them. He is the only son of parents who don't play music, and he grew up in a small town in southern Sweden. Now, at 30 years old, he is one of the best trumpet players in the world. He plays music from old composers and also new music. When you meet him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of his trumpet. 

Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London. There was also a TV show about his work and life, filmed in both London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo, and his career started because of a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved it and played all the time. His mother found a trumpet teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, who was a talented musician. Bo saw Hakan's natural talent right away. Hakan is grateful for having such a good teacher from the start. Bo was very passionate about the trumpet and always looked for new ways to play better.

Hakan learned to work with the trumpet's imperfections. He says, ""The trumpet is not perfect, but you can learn to work with its flaws."" Even as a child, Hakan had a special sound that people could recognize. Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player who started in brass bands, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter who also played solo. Hakan bought all his records and looked up to him. His parents supported his dream to become a professional trumpet player.

At 15, Hakan needed to decide where to study. America was too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra is like working in a garden. Hakan knew he was good, but it was during a competition in Paris at 17 that he realized he could really connect with people through music. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for practice. Hakan only prepared for the first round but made it to the final. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed playing and noticed that people listened to him, even if he thought he didn't play perfectly.

Hakan is realistic about his talent and doesn't try to explain why he can connect with people through music. He believes that music's power is in its ability to move people."

**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I work with customer programs for our credit card users. I help start and manage the Membership Rewards program in Europe. I talk to current card users, find new ones, and work with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes planning my day and answering emails. I handle advertising for the membership program, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan and develop strategies.

CAE_45,"**Career Power: How to Be a Good Leader at Work**

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**

A good leader inspires others and helps them change. They show the way forward. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says leadership is about making things happen with people who are as excited as you are. Enthusiasm is important. A good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. They should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. **Can Anyone Be a Leader?**

John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says many people can be leaders, but they don't know it. To become a leader, you need to find and use your hidden talents. We are all born with the ability to lead, but we need the right situation to show it. We often see leaders like Mahatma Gandhi or Richard Branson, but leadership is also important in our own jobs.

C. **Think About Your Bosses**

Think about the best and worst boss you have had. Both might have been good at meeting goals and deadlines. But how did they do it? The best boss motivated and supported you. The worst boss made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first boss led well; the second just managed badly.

D. **Leaders vs. Managers**

Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new paths. A good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a company for the better.

E. **Improve Your Leadership Skills**

Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can learn to be a better leader. Here are some tips:

- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you care about and act on it.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Believe in your ability to lead.
- Sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their views, try taking the lead yourself.
- Set goals and try to beat them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better.

F. **Keep Learning**

- Leadership takes practice. You need to take risks and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, and organize.
- Your way of leading might not work for everyone. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas should be.
- Be visible and easy to reach for those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your help is needed and help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created this exciting Cold War thriller. It is about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team are brave and funny, reminding us of heroes in old movies. The special effects are amazing, but the story is simple and the dialogue is not very strong.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on a book about the battle for Guadalcanal. Directed by Andrew Marton, it is a more traditional war movie compared to Terrence Malick's new version. Marton's film focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. It has some good moments, like a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife. This scene is more intense than Malick's softer version.

**C. On Guard**  
This movie is based on a novel from 1875. It is a fun adventure with sword fights. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain, and Vincent Perez is a lively hero. Daniel Auteuil is a serious acrobat-turned-swordsman. The movie uses many costume-drama clichés, but it is entertaining and full of energy.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film looks like a museum piece because of its detailed costumes and sets. Jan Decleir plays a strict bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is harsh when evicting people. The story focuses on his difficult relationship with his son, but the film spends too much time on period details.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video shows director Leone's skills well. The sound is very clear, making every noise stand out. The story is intense, and the music by Morricone adds excitement. The main characters, played by Clint Eastwood, Lee van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, are all equally ruthless as they travel through the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This war movie features many international stars and thousands of extras. It is a big production with four directors. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow. The movie is impressive in size but is better suited for the big screen. Watching it on video makes it less impactful."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a very interesting book. The story is about a lawyer who starts a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife in a murder trial. The trial is exciting, and the ending is surprising. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" is an exciting story. It is set in the Italian Renaissance and follows Sigismondo, who solves problems for rich people. He deals with politics and murder. The story is a bit complicated and long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. The main character, Leah Hunter, is a tax inspector. She starts investigating when a man dies near her. Leah is brave and smart, and she is a great character.

**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker is about a private investigator named Spenser. He helps his friend Hawk to stop drug dealers in Boston. The book has fast dialogue and some action. It is entertaining and well-written.

**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate a crime at a famous actress's daughter's house. The writing is easy to read, and the story is interesting.

**BOOK F**  
""Blood Red, Snow White"" is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It is about a lawyer who helps a woman, but then he becomes a victim. The story has romance, money, and violence, making it a thrilling read.

**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw is about actor Philip Fletcher. He is part of a movie about Robin Hood, but things go wrong. The book is funny, but not as good as Shaw's other works.

**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" by Lawrence Gough is a detective story. Canadian police try to catch a smart bank robber who targets female bank workers. The story builds tension well and is better than many other detective books."
CAE_57,"Text: Tim Pozzi is 34 years old. He left his good job to go backpacking. He wants to travel in South East Asia for a year. Tim is a bit nervous because he is older now. After university, he traveled for two years in North and South America. He always wanted to travel again, but life got busy. He fell in love, started a career, and bought a flat. But he felt he was giving up his happiness for money. When he quit his job, he felt free. 

Many of Tim's friends are married with children. They have responsibilities, but Tim does not. He is not in a relationship and has no big career plans. He wants to enjoy his freedom. But he is nervous about renting his flat and planning the trip. He is also worried about living simply again and meeting younger backpackers. 

Many people in their late twenties and thirties want to travel. They want to leave their busy lives and see the world. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people now know they can have adventures if they are brave and organized. 

Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, are traveling for a year before settling down. Danny says he is ready to give up job security for the trip. Matt, who left the Army, traveled for a year to change his way of thinking. 

Today, more people work on short-term contracts. Some companies let people take breaks from work to travel. Dan Hiscocks from Travellerseye says many people in their thirties think about their lives and want change. Travel helps them think about what they really want. 

Jennifer Cox says people now want a balanced life, not just to pay bills. Ben, a 32-year-old, is going to Central America. He is not running away; he is looking for something new. He is a bit scared to leave his routine, but he wants to try. 

Tim feels the same. He is excited about the next year. He wants to enjoy life and see what happens. Many people like Tim want to travel and find new adventures."
CAE_42,"Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job in journalism. She felt she didn't know much about new technology. Here, she tells how she changed her home into a good place to work. Two Christmases ago, she turned 37 and realized she needed to restart her career in journalism. Her skills were old, from the 1980s, when people used typewriters. She thought no one would hire her to work on a computer. Many jobs wanted people who knew desktop publishing, but she didn't. She felt she had a better chance of teaching nuclear physics than using a computer to design a page. She was not good with technology; even simple things like calculators confused her. She didn't know how to use the timer on the video player. She knew she needed to learn quickly.

Then, she entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package for her family. They got a laptop for her husband and a personal computer for everyone. They started learning about new things like the Internet and surfing the web. They talked to people around the world online. The children stopped watching TV, and Georgina set up a small office in the kitchen. She had a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. She could work from home and still take her children to school. The children were good with computers because they learned at school. Georgina was scared she might lose her work by pressing the wrong button, but she learned the basics. It was easy and made sense. She learned more every day.

Now, she writes two articles a month for a magazine. She feels happy because she can work and be with her family. The computer helps her stay organized. She uses spreadsheets to track money and has ready-made invoices and letterheads. The Internet helps her research stories and talk to other journalists. But working from home can be lonely. There are also distractions, like house chores, and the children sometimes argue over who uses the computer. Many people now buy computers for learning and fun. In her neighborhood, people work from home instead of traveling to the city. 

A report says the typical computer user is 38 years old and well-educated. Most have a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Georgina feels she is doing well. She hopes to send articles to newspapers in Melbourne or even start her own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has new, modern buildings that look different from the old city around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened to see if the inside was as interesting as the outside.

The museum is easy to find because of its big, yellow sandstone tower and unique shape. People had different opinions about the building. Some loved it, calling it a ""masterpiece,"" while others were not sure or did not like it at all.

Inside the museum, there are many stories about Scotland's history. The museum shows important objects like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel. The museum does not just focus on national pride but tells many different stories.

Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be fun and interesting for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no fake scenes or made-up stories. The museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some computers to tell the stories.

When you enter the museum, you see many different rooms with pale walls and big display cases. There is a lot of natural light, and you can take your time to look at everything.

The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of 9- to 12-year-olds from Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a special hands-on area for kids.

On the top floor, there is a Twentieth Century gallery. It shows objects that people in Scotland think are important, like an electric guitar, televisions, and toys. This part of the museum will change every three years.

Dr. Clarke believes that objects help us understand the past better than anything else. The modern building looks great from the inside, but some people wonder if it fits well with the old city around it."
CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print newspapers might take a long time. Change can be scary for some people, but it can also be exciting. Transition means moving from the present to the future. For newspapers, moving to the online world is not easy. Many people think it will happen because print newspaper sales are going down, and visits to their websites are going up. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have fewer print sales, but more people visit their websites. However, the situation is not the same everywhere. In some places, like Asia, print sales are still growing. News magazines are also doing well, with a 5.4% increase in sales. Books are another example. E-readers like Kindle are popular, but physical book sales are almost the same as before. People still like both screens and paper. Many young people still read newspapers. In the UK, newspaper sales have dropped, but in Germany and France, the drop is smaller. This shows that the situation is different in each country. In the US, online ads are not making as much money as before, so newspapers are charging for online access. Many newspapers offer a deal with both print and online access. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions. Print ads make more money than online ads. This is a problem for newspapers because running both print and online editions is hard and expensive. But print still helps newspapers stay well-known.'"
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

Taking pictures of people is very interesting. Photos with people in them are usually more exciting than those without. But, taking good pictures of people can be hard. You need to think about how people move and show their feelings. Sometimes, the camera can make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**

When taking pictures of groups, don't make them stand in straight lines. Ask them to stand at different angles or levels. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces. You can also take the picture from a higher place.

**B. Posing for Pictures**

People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. They can fold their hands or put them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**

Don't pretend you are not taking a picture. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken. They might feel shy at first, but they usually like it. You might need to guide them a bit. Make sure they are not looking away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**

A picture is more powerful if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. Remind them to look just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**

Instead of looking at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the picture feel more natural. It looks like you are watching them without them knowing.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures show a lot about a person. A laughing child makes us smile, while a sad face makes us feel sad too. Look for familiar expressions like winks, anger, or thumbs-up. They are easy to understand.

**G. Situation Interest**

A background can add more information to a picture. Make sure the background is not too busy. Focus on the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**

When people are talking, joking, or working together, you can take great pictures. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Show how one person reacts to another.

**I. People and Places**

Many pictures are taken on holidays to show where people visited. Use a wide-angle lens to include the background. Ask people to stand close to the camera. This way, you can see both the people and the place.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose with a nice background. Family pictures can be more fun if they are not posed. Candid pictures of real moments are more lively and memorable."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist who makes trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye and look very real. Joanna Watt interviews her.

Sarah Janson does not usually sign her paintings unless someone asks her to. She believes the art is more important than the artist. Sarah is very humble and sometimes acts like her paintings make themselves. She does not like to talk about herself and feels shy about being photographed.

Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she did not enjoy illustration. She then worked with a decorator named Jim Smart, who asked her to make a trompe-l'oeil painting. She loved it and decided to start her own business.

Sarah's skills in observing and focusing on details help her in trompe-l'oeil art. She says you cannot learn trompe-l'oeil from someone else; it is about observing life. She believes she is still learning and says, ""If you think you know everything, you should stop.""

Sarah is honest about her weaknesses. She says she cannot paint bread well and struggles with math. When she had to paint a big ceiling, she felt confused and thought, ""Who do you think you are, Michelangelo?""

Sarah sometimes talks about herself in the third person, saying, ""I didn't do it, she did."" Her work is very good, and she has many important projects. Her paintings often look like parts of buildings. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and a corridor that seems to lead to more rooms.

Trompe-l'oeil art must trick you and keep your interest. Sarah believes it should also be personal for the client. She enjoys working with clients and getting ideas from them. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.

Sarah appreciates her clients and says she is thankful for those who let her paint on their walls. She is always busy because people like her work, even though she does not like to talk about her talent. She says, ""I don't like to shout about myself. Like my work, I am quiet. You get bored with things that shout."" But you could never get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves more attention."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

**A** The way we work is changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or our skills, but also by how we handle ourselves and others. This is important for getting jobs and promotions. These new skills can show who will do well and who might not. They are important for future jobs too. These skills are not about doing well in exams. They are about social skills and personal qualities like being able to start things, understand others, adapt, and persuade. These are called emotional intelligence.

**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, so personal qualities are important at work. Emotional intelligence is a new name for skills like understanding and managing our own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. It is not just about being nice. Sometimes it means telling the truth even if it is hard. It is about managing feelings well so people can work together towards a goal.

**C** Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as important for managers. The more complex the job, the more these skills matter. People with good emotional intelligence can work better with others. In jobs that need teamwork and focus on customers, these skills are very important for doing well.

**D** Unlike IQ, which stays the same, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. We can get better at handling emotions, motivating ourselves, and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence skills, which are important when jobs are not stable. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but it helps everything work better."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones make it easy to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, news often appears first on social media. Some journalists use these pictures from social media when events happen quickly. But sometimes, they use these pictures without asking for permission. There are rules that say it's okay to use pictures without permission in special cases or if the public needs to know. However, people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means that pictures from regular people are important for the media. But, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people get credit and ask for permission before using their work.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture: An Old Practice**

Acupuncture is a part of ancient Chinese medicine and is about 2,000 years old. It includes using herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is mainly known in the West for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it to help people feel less pain.

**How Does It Work?**

In traditional Chinese medicine, being healthy means your mind, body, and spirit are balanced. Energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), moves through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ. If Qi is blocked or weak, you might feel sick or weak. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulse, looks at your tongue, and asks about your health and habits to find where Qi is not balanced. They use thin needles on the skin to help Qi flow better. Sometimes, they use heat or pressure on certain points.

**Acupuncture Points**

There are over 300 points on the main meridians where needles can be placed. These points might not be near where you feel pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This feeling means the needle has reached the Qi.

**Scientific View**

Even if they don't believe in traditional Chinese ideas, some doctors think acupuncture can help with pain. They say it might work by blocking pain signals to the brain or by releasing natural painkillers in the body.

**Types of Pain Treated**

People with long-term pain often try acupuncture. It is used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in very sick people.

**Modern Use**

Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years. In the 1950s, it started being used instead of anesthesia during surgery. This showed some doctors outside China that acupuncture could be more than just a mental effect. In China, it is used in many surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia.

**Effectiveness**

It is hard to test acupuncture in clinical trials, but some studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with long-term pain. Acupuncturists say it usually takes six or seven visits to feel real relief, but some improvement can be felt after two or three visits.

**Different Views on Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They try to find out what makes the pain worse, like cold, heat, or dampness. This helps them decide how to treat the pain.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals are trained in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. Traditional acupuncturists believe their way can lead to a longer-lasting cure. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist who will refer you to a doctor if needed."

P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband, Connor Bantry White, in Cambridge. He was a doctor who became very sick after World War II. She had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped take care of the children.

She worked for the National Health Service and later for the Home Office. She worked in the Police Department and the Criminal Law section. She saw many dead bodies while working in forensic science, but she was more interested in writing stories than in death itself. She always wanted to be a writer and liked detective stories.

Writing detective stories helped her become a better writer. She believes that solving a crime in a story shows that life is important, even if the person is not very nice. She thinks nobody really likes violence."
CAE_5,"Title: Handwriting Can Show Who You Are

In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. This is called handwriting analysis or graphology. Many people believe it is a real science. They say it can show if someone has certain illnesses like heart disease or cancer. It can also show how a person feels or if they have emotional problems.

Handwriting analysis is used to help people choose jobs and during job interviews. Many big companies use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. But many doctors and psychiatrists do not believe in graphology.

Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, thinks doctors should take it seriously. She says handwriting can show a person's social class, intelligence, and even if they are honest or not. She believes it can also show if someone might commit a crime. Criminals often have messy handwriting. They might write like children or go over letters many times.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can show if someone is under a lot of stress or if they might become violent. It can even show if someone might think about suicide. Health problems like heart and lung issues can also appear in handwriting. If handwriting changes a lot over time, it might mean something serious is happening.

Handwriting can also show other things about a person. If letters are connected like 'threads,' the person might be clever but tricky. Writing in all capital letters might mean someone is hiding their true self. Light writing can show sensitivity. Original handwriting can show confidence and artistic talent. Small signatures might mean someone feels shy or not good enough. Circles over the 'i' can mean the person wants attention. Crossing the 't' heavily can show someone is not tolerant.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to analyze handwriting well. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She believes it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can show a person's history without asking questions.

However, some psychiatrists do not agree. They say handwriting is just about education and artistic skill, not about personality or health."
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy, healthy team, says a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. Our expert team included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple. There is no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open to the street. The team of seven people seems happy and has few complaints. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, like at home. This might be why they are happy: they have created a homely work environment without outside rules.

Ergonomist: The furniture is mixed and does not match. Some of it causes bad sitting positions. Chairs are old, most can't be adjusted, and many are broken. But the team has different tasks, like office work, meeting clients, and giving presentations. This variety helps prevent tiredness and boredom.

Occupational Psychologist: The staff enjoys the variety of work and the flexible office space. They think the office is 'just the right size'—small enough to know what others are doing, but big enough to work alone. The office is attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is not very exciting but comfortable. The air quality is good, helped by a No Smoking policy.

Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good. Space is good, but the layout could be better. The office is impersonal with grey, bare walls.

Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are okay. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information more easily. Success stories or project information could be shown on the walls.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: People have mixed feelings about this office. It feels like being in a glass case. Even with smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air is not stale. You can't smell cigarettes even when close to a smoker.

Ergonomist: The office is very standard and not inspiring. Desks are just okay. Not all chairs meet requirements, but this is the user's choice. Computer screens are on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is not good for modern equipment.

Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and have good technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet make it look a bit dull. The office is busy.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It's hard to say anything good about this office. The air-conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and desks are too small. The office is dusty, and the roof collects dust, which falls on people below.

Ergonomist: The furniture looks like it belongs in a workshop, not a high-tech office. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially shorter people. Many chairs are old, can't be adjusted, and have armrests that keep users too far from the desk.

Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust everywhere. The office needs cleaning and better air conditioning because there are many smokers. Few people were talking when we visited; everyone seemed stressed by deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork.'"
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million pieces every day. It has less than ten calories per piece and is considered a food, so it must follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and make it feel nice to chew.

A long time ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and make their breath smell nice. In America, early settlers learned from the Native Americans in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States could buy spruce gum, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, growing sapodilla trees for chicle has not been successful. As the gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were created. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They walk long distances in hot, humid forests to collect chicle. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly is especially bad because it lays eggs in the chicleros' ears and nose. Chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which they carry to a camp to boil and make into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with simple food and local alcohol.

Even though their work is difficult, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. The United States used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetic materials to save money and meet demand.

Gum producers are finding new ways to sell their products. They say gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were given gum. Gum is also said to reduce tooth decay by increasing saliva, which helps protect teeth. Research continues to find new textures and flavors. Glycerine and vegetable oils are used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural help. In America, 137 square kilometers of land is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

CAE_47,"**The Hotel Inspector**

Sue Brown works as a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they are good. Christopher Middleton watched her do her job. 

When Sue visits the Globe Hotel, things start to go wrong quickly. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue. Sue whispers, ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake she has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide Sue works for. 

Sue is not happy with the hotel entrance. She had to use a buzzer to get in and walk through a long, empty corridor. Then, the receptionist says they have no record of Sue's booking. Most of the hotel rooms are empty that night. Sue checks a room on the top floor and does not like it. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

Sue is known for being tough. People used to call her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black. The next morning, after paying her bill, Sue tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks worried. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that room. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has only been at the hotel for five months. Sue tells him that her feedback will help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. The dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks what they need to do to get three rosettes. Sue says, ""Not serve a pudding that collapses.""

Sue's job is to tell hotels what they need to improve. Sometimes people get upset with her feedback. She has to give a full written report to the hotel. Hotels pay to be in the guide, so they want to know how to improve. 

Sue tells Greaves that she will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. This is good news. But another inspector will come in the next two months to check if the hotel has improved. Greaves says, ""Good,"" but he does not look happy."

The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel treat returning guests in a special way. It cost a lot of money, but MacCann believes it will be worth it. For example, if a guest likes certain music CDs, they will have them ready on their next visit. The system remembers what guests like. Many guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a special system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little in their rooms. The front desk can also change it more if needed. Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. MacCann thinks many guests will be business people. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing tool. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. They have extra cables and rent TVs so they can easily update them. DVD players can also be upgraded. Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large rooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

FCE_24,"Susan Shepherd is an artist who paints flowers. She is famous for her flower paintings. Her house has a big garden with many flowers. She likes tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden by themselves. The garden looks nice because of the colors and shapes of the flowers. The people who lived there before Susan loved gardening and left many plants for her. They also left a gardener named Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. Sometimes she paints a group of flowers, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She paints one flower, which can take a few days, and then adds another. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. She is very busy in spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds it interesting to watch how flowers change. For example, tulips change shape when you put them in water.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She did not like garden flowers before because they looked fake to her. She liked wildflowers because they grew in difficult places like rocks or cliffs. Now, her garden has plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas. She lets the garden grow naturally, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely. Susan is busy with two art shows and has less time for gardening. She hired another gardener but still likes to work in the garden to stay connected to her flowers."
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell down during the big storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This changed how the town center looked, and some people were not happy about it. One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. But during the storm, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, told him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forget things and get angry easily. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. He was too weak to argue. The doctor gave him antibiotics, and Molly took him home to rest. On Thursday morning, Molly told him the walnut tree in their garden had fallen, but Pelham was too sick to understand. By Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged. When he heard it wasn't, he was relieved and went back to sleep. On Saturday, after the medicine worked and he felt better, he saw that the missing walnut tree changed how the living room looked. The Pelhams' house was big and had a nice garden. Pelham liked the house because the garden made it feel private. But now, without the tree, the living room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was not nice anymore. The tall house next door, which the tree used to hide, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. Pelham said to his wife, ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed happy. She said, ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"Living in the Valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Before that, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were a problem, but they did not worry us too much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which was usually calm, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys. They moved and rose, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain came from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and getting close to danger. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like a waterfall, as water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water rushed down. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes came true as the dam held and the water started to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded the nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, everything is fine; the water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only a little overflow sometimes. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Mark Adams is a film critic. He has worked for a newspaper called The Front Page for ten years. Writing about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he wrote reviews for novels, films, and radio. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and TV. Tom hired Mark, but Tom was not mainly a journalist. He wanted a team of critics to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have weekly lunches to choose what to write about, and there would be guests to make it fun. 

Mark felt like he was dreaming because he was part of a new newspaper. He thought it was strange that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even thought a rich person might be pretending to hire him. He was not very confident. The first time he saw someone reading his review on the London Underground, he felt shy.

Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned and talked on the phone instead. People liked to know a reviewer for one subject, so Mark chose films. Thanks to Tom, Mark now writes a long piece each week about one film. He likes this way of working. He would not like to review every film that comes out because it would be boring. 

Mark wonders what his role is. He thinks people choose films because of the stars, the publicity, or the director. People usually stick to the types of films they like. A review might not change their mind. Mark does not feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. He just needs to give his opinion. He is not a judge and does not want to be one."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner. The partner should be a sports fan, preferably female, and interested in distance running, swimming, and cycling. The triathlon is becoming a popular Olympic sport. Many people watch athletes swim, cycle, and run without stopping. But why do athletes want to push their bodies so hard? And why does a smart 17-year-old girl, with good school results, choose this difficult sport?

Melanie Sears is a young triathlete. She hasn't learned to say things like ""personal satisfaction"" or ""mental challenge"" yet. She says, ""You swim 1500 meters, then get on your bike while still wet. You feel cold. After cycling 40 kilometers, you run 10 kilometers, which is hard when you're tired. But it's great fun and worth it.""

Melanie did her first triathlon at 14. She won the junior section because she was the only junior. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. She was fast in swimming and running but got lost while cycling and went 20 kilometers too far. She cried during the run but didn't give up.

Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director, admires her determination. He says she worked so hard on a running machine that it threw her off. Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She is working hard to improve her cycling.

Her parents are paying for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships. She wants a new bike to compete in more races. Her training is tough, and she doesn't have much of a social life. She says, ""I'm not a party person. After swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I talk to other girls in the team about their race times.""

Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" which is shorter. She wants to try even harder events. She says, ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with."" It's interesting, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about collecting things and why many people like this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults enjoys this hobby too. Collecting is full of passion and happiness. But remember, if you don't love an object, don't collect it.

Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty.

I have collected things all my life, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. My parents took me to a local museum full of old objects. I loved these objects.

Many people like collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. Some people collect because it gives them control. For me, it's just fun.

A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great effort. I once got a special tulip from another collector, but it was later stolen.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them. But my collection was destroyed in a house fire. I was very sad.

I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet is valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable if you kept the original boxes. (I threw mine away, including the toys.)"

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions at the Science Museum. I plan and design the exhibition and tell people about it. First, I learn about the exhibition topic and talk to experts. I decide on the main ideas and choose what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to keep the exhibition safe. Before it opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start work at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. I prepare new maps and documents for students to learn the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are learning how to make the journeys. They find the best route using the correct streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. Before the test, I give them a simple route and then change it to make them think of another way.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but mostly I am by the sea. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for people who make decisions about the sea. I take them out on a boat to help them understand sea life better. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. But, I work for a charity, so we always need more money, and I can't do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I make sure our publishing matches what people want and keep stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information. We get letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I answer them carefully. I talk about future projects and sales with co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job fun. The downside is there is too much paperwork, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made some changes, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I, have been playing cards together for a long time. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We think it's quite a coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" These are the names of the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that, and her husband does repairs. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur took our luggage to the rooms, carrying as much as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June, Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the path to the seashore. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then come back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is fun for a year or two before starting a serious job. She meets many successful people every week.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the hardest part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. She skis as much as she can, sometimes until 4:30 p.m.

Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower but does not sleep because it makes her too tired. Dinner is at 8 p.m., and coffee is served by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and loads the dishwasher. Sometimes she talks with the guests, and other times they want to be alone. Good guests make the week fun, but some weeks are not as good.

Sarah meets her friends at her chalet and they go out around 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. She does not stay out late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for leaving guests is ready by 7 a.m. After they leave, she cleans everything quickly. If she did not shop on Saturday, she does it now. At 3 p.m., she prepares tea for new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests with ski equipment. Then she gets a ride back to the chalet. After dinner, she might have a drink or go to bed early if she is very tired."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie. But she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by curly hair. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita Cohen was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, these children came from their school 50 kilometers away to see how Marie's dad made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove over hot brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table. Marie called them 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.

Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, 'They come to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' Rita said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered, 'You should visit a tannery if you're writing about leather. I can arrange that for you. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but it's not very different from hundreds of years ago. It's hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. They found 6,000-year-old tanning relics in Turkey. The first clothes were just skins tanned by smoking them. It's an interesting subject. My father knows a lot about leather; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for two days. Glovemen love their trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' Rita replied, 'I can't say I have.' Seymour laughed when she said she saw her mother make a cake as a child. She made him laugh. She was eager to learn, like his daughter Marie, who was taller and fairer than Rita but had the same intelligence and curiosity.

Seymour said, 'I'll show you the whole process. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you can watch from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,"**Is it a dream job?**

Chris Arnot talks to four people with jobs that many people dream about. Are these jobs really as great as they seem?

**A. Raquel Graham**

Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she travels a lot. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But she has one small problem - she doesn't like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,"" she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde because it felt closed in with small windows. When not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does paperwork, organizes the diary, attends meetings, and makes travel plans. She got the job by chance after meeting a pop group manager. She took secretarial classes at night and five years later, she became a PA.

**B. David Brown**

David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He liked being a caddy more because he loves golf. But there are downsides. Caddies get a small fee and a part of the winnings. They earn between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of it goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman at age 31. ""You're not just carrying bags. You give advice and try to understand the golf course,"" he says. His accountancy skills were noticed, and now he works as a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes golf statistics for TV commentators, magazines, and golfers.

**C. Martin Fern**

Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a newspaper. One of his fun tasks is trying food at top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""If people can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent got him a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. At the time, Martin was a creative director at an ad agency, and the column was extra income. At 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant earning 50% less,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job."" He still cooks at home and stays fit by cycling to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**

""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. ""Before that, I loved words and wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, my first published children's story."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy. I work on them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I type out my morning notes with one finger on an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and I enjoy this part of being a writer. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, workers cut trees into boards for building. There was an old two-story brick building there, surrounded by big piles of soft sawdust. These piles looked like golden mountains and went all the way to the blue lake. One afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored, so they climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and he jumped off the roof onto the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all scared,"" he said, trying to get them to jump too. They looked down, scared, but then one by one, they jumped and felt happy. They lay on the sawdust, telling jokes in the hot sun. Then one friend said, ""Let's go up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and jumped again, except for Michael. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump but stayed on the roof, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and jump, but he couldn't. His friends laughed and got tired of waiting. They started to leave, shouting, ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" Michael stayed on the roof, looking at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour as the sun set. His clothes were wet from sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, and fell on the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The workers had gone home, and it was quiet. He wondered why he couldn't jump before. Then he got up and walked home, feeling ashamed. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said, ""You're old enough to come home on time. If you can't, stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke seriously, but Michael, feeling sad, didn't really hear her. He kept thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy with your job and don't know how to change it? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people who want to change jobs go to a careers adviser. You will write a short history about yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a report with career suggestions and any retraining you might need.

I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The test felt like a science exam. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. It wasn't about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the test, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and advice. I agreed with most of it, but I was surprised I did poorly in science and technical tests. I was happy to hear I made the right choice with journalism.

Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to try Career Analysts. She wanted to look at her skills and interests again. She found out she was good at design but had to think about the cost of retraining. Other ideas included working in the Far East for a year. She decided to use her skills in a new job as a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped her see what she wanted to do. She recommended them to her friends.

Some people feel they couldn't have changed without help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services. She worked at a bank for six years and wanted a new challenge. The tests showed she liked sciences. After four meetings with an adviser, she decided to study geology. She plans to start a degree in it. She thinks the advice was worth the money and feels happier now.

However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, didn't find it helpful. She wanted new ideas but didn't like the suggestions because they meant less money or more training. She felt she didn't learn anything new about herself. She thought a friend could have given similar advice."
FCE_22,"Title: Fun at the Dentist's?

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch. Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Half of the people only go to the dentist when they have pain. They are scared of the dentist."" To help with this, he tries to make his office a place where people are not afraid. He does not wear a white coat because it reminds people of pain. Jerome believes that going to the dentist should be relaxing and even fun.

Many people think of dental visits as painful or very serious. Jerome wants to change this. He uses virtual-reality headsets to help patients relax. His office was the first in Britain to use them. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while he looks at their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth. Most patients like this part of their visit.

The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like oranges. Jerome says, ""I want people to know it's not like a regular dentist's office. Smell is important. The usual dentist smell can make people nervous."" The pleasant smell helps people feel calm.

Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, but he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but good treatment is the most important. He uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but it is not painful if you are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. He learned that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for the dentist. He wants to make British dentistry less formal. When a patient arrives, Jerome offers tea and asks what video they want to watch. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,"**Chocolate: A Sweet History**

Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought during this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.

Chocolate has been made in factories since the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan people in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a name that came from a spelling mistake in the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in their language. They flavored the drink with spices for special events. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread in Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities where people drank chocolate.

Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when Fry and Sons in Bristol mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies led the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add some French style. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, first called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular with ads linking it to healthy English milk. Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week.

To attract more customers, chocolate makers are creating new products like chocolate ice cream, drinks, and desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, next time you eat a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke is 83 years old and very good at his art. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But right now, he is happy making beautiful things from shells. He has been doing this for ten years.

Peter shows me his work in his apartment. He is very excited about it, and his work is very beautiful. He shows me some shell ornaments above his fireplace. He says he doesn't mind if people don't buy them because he loves them. He never planned to sell his work, but friends told him to have an exhibition. So, he did, and many pieces were sold in London. His second exhibition just opened, and his work is expensive. Some pieces cost around £2,000.

Peter says he doesn't set the prices. He believes no one else makes art like his. The gallery owner told him that people will want his work because he won't make it forever. Peter wishes he started this art earlier in life because he could have made even more amazing things. Now, he feels a bit limited because of his age.

His work is very different from the shell items you find in seaside shops. He makes boxes with tiny shells, pictures, and flowers that look real. He uses simple materials like cardboard, glue, and washing-up liquid for his work. He says he has an idea, and the work just happens, but it looks very detailed and planned.

Peter looks for beautiful shells in many places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and does not harm living creatures. He says people walking on the beach break more shells than he collects. He believes his art makes the shells even more beautiful."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is 15 years old. When she is not traveling to beautiful places and being on magazine covers, she is studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

The receptionist at the agency told me, ""Kira will be a little late."" I said, ""Oh, fine, no problem."" I was worried because I had read bad things about models. People say they are difficult, vain, and not smart. I thought Kira might be late because she was at the hairdresser's or didn't want to talk to me. If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and said sorry for being late. She came with her mother. Kira was wearing a simple black dress and trainers, not expensive designer clothes. She was very friendly, tall, and pretty. 

All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Kira's mother looked like a normal mum and was proud of her daughter. Kira seemed surprised by her fame because it was not planned. Her older sister wanted her to join the model competition. Kira said no, but her sister sent photos anyway. When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected gave her confidence, and she did well in the final. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work.

Kira now has to manage her two lives: school and modeling. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too much of herself. This is hard for Kira because she is not self-important. She says, ""I am more confident now, but not in a bad way. I can stand up for myself.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime for a job the next day. She can't always make plans with friends, but they understand. They don't complain that she is always busy with modeling.

Kira has the looks, talent, and support for a great career. Not many people can say that before finishing school. At the end of the interview, I ask Kira what she would like to do if she wasn't a model. She thinks and says, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Search for Gold

Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son team. They have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they believe they are very close to finding a lot of gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, said, ""We are finding a lot of gold as we dig. We just need to dig a few more meters.""

The Maddens have spent their lives looking for gold. They started after Terence read about gold in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" near a Welsh town with the same name. They read old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to find the best place to dig. They cleared the land, found some gold in the rocks, and spent ten years getting permission to dig. They also took samples of the earth and removed old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they need more money. They have used their savings and need someone to give them £50,000 to dig a bit more to find the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it looks difficult, but we have some people we can ask.""

Last week, people in the valleys heard about the dig, and many became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and the people there are hopeful. Peter Woolven, who manages the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, more people might visit, but I hope not too many come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry was very big in the late 1880s, with many mines and workers. But now, it has declined. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, some people are still looking for gold. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. Hall, who is 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's exciting to find hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemical processes in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.

When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. She dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots next to her. They cannot stand up or move much. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive can last 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.

If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it might not be a nice journey.

Rachel was nervous the first time she went into the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck. She got in with an instructor. He explained what to do in emergencies, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a place five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was putting scientific equipment there to study a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she loves. But she teaches so she can do her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out fast and is very hot, at 350 degrees.

Rachel was scared once when she first went down with the Americans. They were towing equipment when there was a big explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle. Rachel thought she was going to die. But nothing happened, and they were safe. The relief was incredible.

Rachel loves the adventure of diving to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time she looks out and sees the chimneys, she feels wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing things no one else has seen. She studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD. Seeing them for real was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was tired of foreign timetables, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. 

I just needed to buy one train ticket, and because I was under 25 years old, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train's movement helps you sleep deeply. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply. Sometimes, you even throw away socks that smell bad or books you have finished reading. This is the Inter-Rail spirit, where you don't need to think too much. 

This train ticket lets young people travel to many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to keep traveling because there was always another country to see. And it didn't cost us extra money. 

We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. We made our own plans and only saw the easiest sights. We wanted to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes I only saw the view from the train station. We just wanted to have fun. 

We were like other Inter-Railers, sharing train floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. 

Seeing Europe, watching the landscapes change, and noticing different lifestyles helps you understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means more when you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. The train trip may not show you new things in the world, but it is a special personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see this, even if it takes time to realize."
FCE_37,"Text: 'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your baggage is not there. If this happens, you might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, you might be in a place with a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it is common for people who travel a lot to lose their luggage sometimes. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and they cannot always promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes. 

Airlines ask passengers to check in early to make sure there is enough time for baggage to go through the airport and onto the plane. The shortest time to change between flights is called Minimum Connecting Time (MCT), and it is also longer to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause baggage issues. Sometimes, human mistakes or accidents, like a torn destination label, can also cause problems. These issues are worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, and nine million of them changed planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with many moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The chance of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your baggage, choose direct flights if you can and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connecting flights by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport. Label your luggage inside and outside with your home and holiday addresses, and include your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport.'"
FCE_2,"Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who loves kingfishers. Kingfishers are beautiful blue-green birds that live near streams and rivers. They eat fish. The area where they live has old trees, soft green colors, and the sound of water. The kingfisher flies very fast and is bright like a light. Charlie loved kingfishers since he was young. He cannot say exactly why he loves them so much. 

There are many stories about kingfishers. In Greek myth, a kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. This story has some truth. Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. Instead, their feathers reflect light, making them look blue or green depending on the light.

Kingfishers are shy, but you can watch them from a hidden place. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket. He waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot, and the bird came very close. It took him four years to take a good picture of a kingfisher. He spent a lot of time by a stream with many kingfishers, but he missed school and did not do well in his studies. 

At 16, Charlie got a job as an advisor for a nature magazine. Later, he worked as a wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make a film about kingfishers with no talking, just beautiful pictures. He loves the simple beauty of kingfishers and their colors. Charlie's photos show his feelings for the kingfisher, but he knows there is more to his love for the bird than he can show in his work."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.

**A. Anne Manson**

Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice in Vienna. She ended up helping because an assistant was missing. Later, she helped with another opera. Anne was not nervous when she first led an orchestra. She works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries. The British Arts Council helped her with money to travel. She has worked with Abbado on many projects since then.

**B. Andrew Constantine**

Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after failing in two others. He thinks the timing was good because if he had won earlier, he might not have succeeded. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. But he worries about being known only for the competition. He hopes orchestras will invite him back, like the English Chamber Orchestra did. If not, his career might not last.

**C. Wasfi Kani**

Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She enjoys the long practice time needed for opera. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional. Learning from Sian Edwards was important for her. She realized she could conduct even though she is small. She likes the complexity of opera and dealing with singers' personalities.

**D. Roger Vignoles**

Roger Vignoles, 48, was surprised to become a conductor, but he finds it interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival. It was easier than he thought because he knew the music well. He tries to get the performance he wants and people respect his musical skills. He learns from every experience and is open to trying new things.

**E. Wayne Marshall**

In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, now 32, and told his agent about him. Marshall soon conducted a musical in London on short notice. It was a tough start, and he had to be firm with musicians who were not paying attention. He always gives a clear beat and is not afraid to say what he wants. He has not formally studied conducting, but people have been supportive. He is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,"**Theme Parks in Britain**

If you want to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many to choose from. We asked five families to visit some of the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. But we were surprised! The park is great for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay longer because they were having so much fun. The park could have better scenery, but the staff are very helpful, and it is clean and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

We had never been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We stayed for six hours and liked that there were places to rest. The park is beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus with its exciting trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared, they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The new ride, Fear Factor, was too big for our kids, which was a relief! The park is well designed, so waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. A staff member even helped us on a ride.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at 1 p.m. and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger kids because the rides aren't too scary. I am usually scared, but I had fun too. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited 30 minutes for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun for brave people. If our kids were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about twelve main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. The staff were sometimes nice, but not always. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't tell the kids we were leaving early!"

**A. Christine Hogan**  
Christine Hogan runs a computer design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Christine had worked with computers before, so her husband suggested starting a computer design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. Christine was careful with spending and talked to the bank if she needed more money. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings. Her business is small, and local people usually come to pick up their work.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no such jobs in the countryside. So, she started her own business and makes 50 different greeting cards, which she sells to museums. Maggy works in a big room at home. The downside is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She doesn't advertise; people hear about her through others. Maggy is cheaper than other artists, so people send her work from London. She misses sharing ideas with others but likes being independent.

**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner makes curtains. Her business has had good and bad times. She started eight years ago, and her business grew quickly at first. She managed six full-time workers, but had to let them go when the economy got worse. Now, Delia makes curtains at home with her husband's help and other women who work from their homes. She has to be ready to lower her prices and find new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because London was too expensive and she loves the country. Tessa likes working when she wants, but she has to take calls at odd hours because most of her business is with Australia, the Far East, and North America. It is hard to stop working sometimes. She publishes children's books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because all her work experience was in London.

**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and has six workers, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, making healthy fruit cakes with good flour and eggs. Friends and family liked them, and soon she was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made. She has a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg doesn't bake now; she manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial part because she didn't have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they all love music. The sons, Paul and Huw, are musicians and composers, and their dad, John, makes musical instruments.

When Paul was ten years old, he needed a cello. But cellos were very expensive. So, John decided to learn how to make one. He went to evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After making some violins and violas, he made his first cello for Paul. It was very good, and Paul used it for many years.

John stopped teaching and now makes violins full-time. He even sold one to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.

Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano, but then he wanted to play the cello. He thought the cello player in his dad's music group was very cool. So, he started learning the cello and became very good at it. Huw also plays music but chose the piano and became a composer.

Paul won a big music competition with his dad's cello. He became the main cellist for the BBC Symphony Orchestra when he was just 20 years old. Now, he plays a very old and special cello from the Royal Academy of Music.

Paul will play this cello on TV in a show called Masterworks. But he can't watch it because he will be playing at a music festival that night. Huw will also be busy because his music will be played in London for the first time.

John and Hetty, their parents, are very proud and try to keep up with all their sons' music events."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is a group that helps protect the countryside in Britain. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust. 

Gareth says a warden needs common sense and must be good with people. He talks to farmers, visitors, and builders all the time. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his family's farm before he got married. Many people wanted the warden job, but Gareth got it because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he didn't have special training.

Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. He is also strong enough to do hard work like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since working with the Trust, Gareth has learned more about taking care of nature. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and now sees how farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault because they followed government advice.

When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists (people who protect nature) did not agree. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth thinks they are close to working together well.

Gareth's job includes conservation, letting people visit Trust land, planting trees, and meeting farmers who rent land from the Trust. He makes sure work is done well and cheaply. He likes finishing projects, but he also spends a lot of time on paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to most visitors, but some people can be rude. They act like they own the place, which annoys him. 

If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But don't expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't people look at you strangely?"" She said, ""I am too focused on my movements and my feet to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra says, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict plan to be very fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries. ""We will have support from people at home, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to make netball more popular in our country. Because we are playing here, there will be more pressure. People will expect us to start with a good game.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of skill."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But Kendra says the World Championships will be hard. ""You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you only have one chance.""

In the 15 years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You train hard to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the game, we are all friendlier.""

Netball now uses more science for fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mind and must lead by example. I support and encourage my team.""

Kendra says, ""From the start, my netball career was carefully planned. I decided this competition would be my last as a player."" She might coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**Specialist Music Schools**

What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents might not notice their child's talent until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or science, but musically talented children need special help. Regular schools might not have this help, especially if music is not important there. 

Children who are very good at music might benefit from going to a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools. These schools help children aged seven to eighteen to improve their music skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras, learn singing, conducting, and music theory. They also practice a lot in special rooms. The rest of their time is for regular school subjects like English, math, science, and languages. 

These music schools are private, and classes are small. Most children live at the school, which means they spend a lot of time with other children who also love music. 

There are some problems with these schools. First, they are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year. But schools try to help with scholarships and financial aid. Second, not all parents want their children to live away from home, especially when they are very young. Some school directors think it might not be good for very young children to be in such a strict environment. They want to make sure children grow up to be well-rounded people.

Being in a music school can be stressful. Some children might lose interest in music as they grow older. The pressure to be the best can make them feel like they have failed. But schools watch the children closely and help them if needed. 

Many students from music schools say they learned a lot about music, but they also wish they had more regular school subjects. Some musically talented children are also very smart and want more academic challenges. 

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves if they want to go to a music school. Children who are good at both music and school subjects might do well in a regular school with a good music program. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges, but this is only possible if they live near a big city like London."
FCE_25,"Susan Shepherd is an artist who paints flowers. She is famous for her flower paintings. Her house has a big garden with many flowers. She likes tulips and poppies the most. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden by themselves. The garden looks nice because of the colors and shapes of the flowers. The people who lived there before Susan loved gardening and left many plants for her. They also left a gardener named Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. Sometimes she paints a group of flowers, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She paints one flower, which can take a few days, and then adds another. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. She is very busy in spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She likes to watch how flowers change over time. For example, tulips change shape when you put them in water.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She did not like garden flowers before because they looked fake to her. She was amazed by how wildflowers grew in difficult places like rocks or cliffs. Now, her garden has plants from different countries, but they grow well there. She lets the garden grow naturally, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely. Susan is busy with two art shows and does not have much time for gardening. She hired another gardener to help, but she knows she needs to work in the garden to stay connected to her art."
FCE_34,"Title: Keeping Holiday Guests Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year doing this job. Sarah cooks and cleans for people who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses. She graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it's a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a serious job. She meets many successful people every week.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then prepares breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the worst part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can. On a good day, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower but does not sleep because it makes her too tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans up and fills the dishwasher. She sometimes talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. Good guests make the week fun, but some weeks are not as good.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. Sarah does not stay out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. She starts work earlier on Sunday because breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet quickly. She clears breakfast, changes the beds, and gets everything ready. If she hasn't shopped on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., she prepares tea for the new guests, who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests with ski equipment and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it's time for dinner again. Sometimes she chats with friends, but if she's very tired, she goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. She found it hard to choose clothes because she usually wears a uniform. First, she went to a photo studio, then to see new clothes, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and quiet, but at the magazine, she was very busy. Some people in the fashion team were stressed, but her job is not stressful. In the afternoon, she went to a fashion photo shoot. She thought it was funny because she usually cleans cages or handles rats. She likes seeing how magazines work, but she loves her job at the zoo and wants to stay there.

Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. She wore leather boots and dark blue trousers, but the zoo gave her a green shirt to wear because she got very dirty. She touched an elephant and thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, she smelled bad but had a great day. She thinks she might work with elephants in Africa when she stops working in fashion.

Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She spent a day with the TV gardening show Ground Force. She was very excited to meet the team. Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. She liked being outside because sometimes she doesn't see daylight due to her work shifts. It was hard work but fun. She thought she was strong but felt weak compared to the team. Gardening was harder than she thought, so she will not leave her nursing job.

Charlie Dimmock is a landscape gardener with Ground Force. She worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. She made beds and gave out medicine. She thought she might faint but was surprised she didn't. The nurses were very friendly, and it felt different from her usual work with men. She feels her job is not as important as nursing. Her day at the hospital was not easy, but it was satisfying.

Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. She wore a uniform and felt different because people respected her. Before the flight, she learned about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack. On the flight to Paris, she gave out magazines. People looked at her, and she felt shy. On the way back, there were 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. She wished she was back in the gym with one adult.

Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. She was worried because she doesn't exercise. She was surprised by how much attention trainers give to one person. In her job, she meets many passengers every day. At lunch, she saw that trainers don't always eat very healthily, but they drink a lot of water. She doesn't want to change her job, but she wants to join a gym and be healthier."

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I love the south of France and visit often. There is a train from Cannes that goes along the coast and into Italy. The views of the sea are amazing, no matter the weather or season. You can also see beautiful gardens and homes. The people on the train are interesting, with both tourists and locals enjoying the journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have taken many train trips, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to the Kruger National Park because I was too young. My first real train station was London Waterloo, and it amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
The Blue Train is special to me because it took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. I heard pink is good for the brain, so I wear it often. The journey through France and up the Nile was a perfect way to relax after our wedding.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
For a work trip, we had to cross a desert in Africa. We took the Desert Express because there was no road. The train schedule was not fixed, and the driver would wait for people. Many people climbed onto the train, even on the roof. At night, the train passed through beautiful landscapes, like a dream.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
I didn't see many trains as a child in Singapore and Cyprus. As a teenager, I made a film in Yorkshire with a railway. The old train line was kept by volunteers, and I fell in love with steam trains. We rode the train whenever we could. When I visited last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights at the station!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Do you want to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. Selling your writing needs knowledge about the 'writing world'. No matter what you write, you need to know about the markets you want to reach. The best way to learn is by reading a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading will show you what publishers want. Remember, things change often—new magazines come out, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. If you want to write short love stories, first find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and see what kind of stories they buy. Pay attention to who the readers are because the editor wants to please them. Writers often ask me, 'My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?' As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But the work might not be ready to publish. Most new writers send their work too soon. If you have only written one story, it is not likely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Write ten or even twenty more. Each story will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I suggest not showing your work to others at first. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections. Do everything you can to become a better writer. Look for a creative writing course near you or join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"
FCE_4,"On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I thought there would be. The station didn't feel as nice and clean as usual. Older couples with matching bags sat on the benches, and many college students sat on the floor with their bags. 

A man with grey hair was talking to different people. He looked rich: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question. Then he talked to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her too. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""I'm going north, yes."" ""But to Philadelphia?"" he asked. ""No, New York,"" she replied. ""Thanks, anyway,"" he said and moved on.

I was curious now. I heard him ask an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Wilmington,"" and he moved on to another couple. I stood up and moved closer, pretending to look at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me. Maybe he thought I looked unreliable. He just glanced at me and walked away. He looked worried now. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She was about thirty-five, older than me. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am.""

""Could I ask you a favor?"" he asked. I pretended to look at my wrist as if I had a watch. The woman seemed cautious. The man said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They announced my train, and people started moving to Gate E. The man continued, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. She forgot her passport. She called home from the station in Philadelphia and didn't know what to do.""

The woman felt sorry for him. I would have waited to see what he wanted. ""I told her to stay there, and I would find someone to bring her passport,"" he said. I thought, why didn't he go himself if it was so important? The woman asked, ""Why don't you go yourself?"" He said, ""I can't leave my wife alone. She's in a wheelchair."" This seemed like a weak excuse to me. 

I looked at them. The man was holding a padded envelope, not a plain one. It was the size of a small book and looked stapled shut. I thought, be careful, lady."

John Moore, a restaurant owner, talks about his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary's chance was cooking, and John's chance was running a restaurant. When John found the restaurant, it was in bad shape, but he thought it was perfect for his plans. 

John remembers his childhood when his mother worked in a factory, and he was sad to be alone. He wanted to have time for family life. His wife took care of the children and helped with the business accounts, while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This was good for their children, Gary and Joe, who became very confident. From a young age, they talked to the restaurant's regular customers, which helped them in life.

Gary was an active child. Once, when he was seven, he jumped into a bath like it was a swimming pool and got hurt. As he grew older, he worked for pocket money. He did small jobs and by age ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend. He was disciplined and woke up early. It was nice to see him helping in the family business. Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as good as the adults working there and sometimes was in charge. He could make over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would work in catering because he was talented.

When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend's restaurant. Gary also started playing the drums and has his own band now. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. John advises Gary to focus on one thing to succeed. He told Gary to achieve his goals by age 30, or it might be too late.

Gary went to catering college at 17. On his first day, he finished his work quickly and helped others. John is very proud of Gary's success with his TV cooking show. John always told Gary that he must work hard for what he wants because nothing is given for free. Gary took his chance and worked hard. John is happy that Gary listened to his advice and learned from it."
FCE_7,"Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult, like finding gold. The best way is to know someone who knows someone leaving a place. But if you are new, like Jo, you don't have any contacts. Jo had just arrived in Dublin, so she stayed in a hostel and searched for a flat. Dublin was a big unknown for her. She didn't think much about why she was going there; everyone at her school expected to leave their small town and see more of the world. Some of her classmates went to nearby towns, but Jo was the only one going to Dublin.

Jo's mother thought it would be safe for her to stay in the hostel run by nuns. Her father hoped it was warm because hostels are often cold. Her sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo didn't know they were all talking about her as she looked at an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, ""Own room, own TV, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to her work at the post office and seemed perfect. She hoped it was nice, that they would like her, and that it wasn't too expensive.

There wasn't a long line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The ""own TV"" part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf, who didn't get the flat, was leaving and said, ""Desperate place. They're both awful."" Jo continued up the stairs.

A girl named Nessa, wearing a T-shirt with her name on it, greeted Jo. Nessa didn't like the girl who just left because she acted snobby. Pauline, the other girl, wore a very colorful shirt and had bright hair. Jo was surprised because Pauline was a punk, and Jo had never talked to a punk before. Jo introduced herself and said she worked at the post office. Nessa offered Jo a mug of tea. They had mugs with their names on them, and one said ""Other."" Nessa said they would put Jo's name on it if she stayed."
FCE_43,"Text: 'Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We like to see them in seaside parks, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are disappearing. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down by up to 89,000. You might think dolphins are protected by law and live in safe places. But this is not true, and not helping them could be a big problem for wildlife. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. The first two live far out in the sea and are seen only in small groups. We do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only in Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few left have skin injuries, showing they are stressed. Dolphins have complex habits, making it hard to know why their numbers are going down. Overfishing is a big problem. It reduces fish stocks and threatens dolphins because they need to find food quickly. If fish are gone, dolphins may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses big nets that float or move fast in the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornwall beaches. Marks and cuts show they died from getting caught in nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can stay in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can eat them, and they build up in their bodies. Female dolphins pass these poisons to their babies through milk. There is a case of a baby dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Another big problem for dolphins is human noise. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This noise may disturb dolphins in ways we do not know yet.'"
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels busy and stressful. You might think, ""Oh no, another article about exercise!"" But there are many good reasons to exercise. Exercise is really good for you.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit correctly, which is called good posture. Good posture is important because it stops muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

Exercise can make you feel less sad and tired. It helps you sleep better and manage stress. Exercise can even help with some health problems. 

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. But be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is very important. It affects how you look and feel. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This helps you stand tall and breathe better. It also makes your body look slimmer.

Stretching your muscles is important too. It makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine. Do it slowly and carefully, four or five times a week.

The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."

In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is hard to find Amanda and Owen. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater. It has rained for six months, causing problems. Owen said they bought an expensive tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud. Amanda can then pull him out. Together, they have made some of TV's best wildlife films, like their famous film about leopards. Even when this film was on TV, they were back in Africa, looking for another shy animal, the jackal.

This is normal for TV partnerships. Film-makers travel the world to film wild animals. I talked to Owen at a safari lodge. He said they sometimes argue but solve it quickly. They do not see one person as the leader. They get along well because they see animals the same way. When they travel, they set up tents every night. But now, they have a fixed camp. They start at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before, keeping it warm in a flask. They eat pre-packed meals, heated by whoever is free. They can be away for up to eight weeks, so food can be a problem.

Living in remote areas is hard, but they like being close to animals. Once, they filmed a lion family. One lioness would leave and come back, greeting all the lions. She even greeted their car. Owen first worked with Amanda in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift'. Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. They spend four months in one place to make enough material for a half-hour film. Before filming, they need to get a script approved. Owen says they work well together because they share the same ideas. They want to make films that show the true spirit of the place and animals and touch people's hearts. Owen believes making people feel something is better than just giving them information."
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'

'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. She follows a strict plan to be very fit. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries playing. 'We will have support from people at home, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to make netball more popular in our country. Because we are playing here, there will be more pressure. People will expect us to start with a good game.'

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'We have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of skill.' The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you only have one chance.'

In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You train hard to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we are all friendlier.' Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, she believes it's important to have a strong mind and lead by example. She supports and encourages her team.

'From the start, my netball career was carefully planned,' she says. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who studies the sea. She works at Southampton University and teaches about the ocean. Rachel also goes on special trips to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She uses a small submarine, about the size of a car, to go deep underwater. Inside the submarine, there is not much space. She can touch the two pilots sitting next to her. They cannot stand up or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A trip can last 16 hours: three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.

If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape pod go up quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has used it yet, but it might not be a fun ride.

Rachel remembers her first time in the submarine. She was on a ship and got in with a teacher. The teacher showed her what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot got sick. They wanted to see how she would feel in the small space. Now, Rachel has done six dives. Last year, she went with a Russian team to a place near the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was putting equipment there to study the volcanoes.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the university. She loves teaching, but she also loves studying the ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes that release hot water that looks like black smoke. The water comes out very fast and is very hot, about 350 degrees.

Rachel was scared once when she was with an American team. They were pulling equipment with a long rope when there was a big explosion. The noise was very loud, and she thought she might die. But nothing bad happened, and they were all okay. It was a big relief.

Rachel thinks diving to the bottom of the ocean is an adventure. She feels amazed every time she sees the underwater volcanoes. She studied them for three years for her Ph.D., and seeing them in real life was an incredible experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. People decide what they think about us in the first few minutes. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, and how we speak. This includes how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also works at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best."" Many people forget how important it is to look professional. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but didn't get an interview. She asked the Director of Personnel why. He said she didn't look like an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was surprised. She thought her work was good and how she dressed shouldn't matter.

How we move and use gestures also affects the interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our feelings and attitudes come from words, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion. Her interview went well, and she got the job offer right away. ""I was very happy,"" she says. ""But I showed too much excitement. When the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't say no. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I think I could have gotten more if I had controlled my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it is important for a successful interview. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This shows you are interested in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and speaking in short, clear sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and clear points."""

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London. Now, he has a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years, but it became boring and not fun anymore. He lost his job suddenly and used the money he got to start the farm. He met a chef from a famous hotel, and now he sells meat to them and also by mail. He is happy not to be in an office, but he still works long hours.

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising. Now, he is an artist. Painting was his hobby, and he enjoyed it more than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him. Most people need to work for money, but Ron and his wife married young, and their children are grown up. They moved to the north of England, far from friends, but their friends still visit them.

**The Hat Maker**

Katherine Goodison was a lawyer for five years. Now, she makes hats in her London flat. She liked her job as a lawyer, but the hours were too long. She left because she didn’t want to work more and more hours. People thought she would get bored, but she didn’t. She likes having deadlines and being in charge of her work. She misses talking to colleagues but likes being responsible for her product.

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years. Now, he is a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance at 22 but didn’t find it rewarding. He almost lost his job in 1989, so he quit and traveled for a year. He wanted to work in health, so he visited gyms and talked to owners. He took massage courses and got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He is happy now and feels in control of his life."
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I tried many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Sadly, it did not get much attention from the media, and I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great places to train and good nightlife. But I have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out before training, I have to say no. I want to go to the next Olympics - that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often early in the morning. So, you can't go to late-night parties if you want to succeed. I don't mind that, but I love sleeping in, and I have to give that up too. It's worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I like to have a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job on a TV surfing show. I guess I'm a bit famous now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When five guys are on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in style. Some people say we act like kids, but we don't look for media attention. Reporters sometimes care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends who do different things. You can't think about the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I don't get recognized on the street often. I don't want to be a celebrity. I get nice letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to play tennis and feel the crowd supporting you. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people around me. I like being noticed by fans when I'm out shopping, but it can be hard. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in sports. You have to be serious and professional. I'm okay with focusing on my game now and doing other things after I retire, which happens early in tennis."
FCE_33,"**Shopping with Children**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not a new sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can't buy all this, and I feel bad if I give in and buy unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset before we even leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things. They don't find reasons like ""sugar is bad for your teeth"" convincing when they see fun and exciting ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. Even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' they still want that to happen.""

Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son is critical of ads, and they look at labels together. She says, ""I've talked so much that he thinks all ads are rubbish. We don't fight in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't buy.""

Parents also say they are not always fair in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be fair all the time.""

Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children aren't with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring in more customers."
FCE_20,"**Luxury and Modern Technology at the Merrion Hotel**

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. 

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel treat returning guests in a special way. It cost a lot of money, but MacCann believes it will be worth it. For example, if a guest likes certain music, the hotel will have it ready for their next visit.

Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little, or the front desk can change it more.

Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and video-conferencing. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. TVs and DVD players can be updated easily.

Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large rooms, a swimming pool, gym, conference rooms, bars, restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the hotel is excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the hotel. This is good for both him and the hotel. He has a new kitchen and better parking. The hotel offers a great place to eat without financial risk.

With technology and a great staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to succeed."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women how they stay energetic and happy. Here is what they said:

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
Jeanette feels energetic when she is excited and learning new things. She loves challenges. Right now, she is learning flamenco dancing, which makes her feel full of energy. She believes that being bored can make you feel tired. Doing something useful, even if it's small, gives her energy.

**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
Linda enjoys her work, so it doesn't feel hard for her. She needs a lot of sleep to feel good. When she sleeps only six hours, she feels tired. Exercise gives her energy, but she finds it hard to start. She does yoga once a week and tries to exercise at home. Exercise makes her feel happy. She feels tired in the afternoon and thinks eating something helps.

**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
Annie gets her energy from being positive and enthusiastic. She doesn't like negative people. She believes in enjoying life and setting goals. Her job is exciting, and she loves being around young, lively people. She enjoys taking photos and writing song lyrics for fun. This helps her relax when she travels a lot.

**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
Floella gets energy from doing things she loves. She believes in being positive and enjoys working with children. Smiling at people and getting a smile back makes her feel good. She tries to eat healthy and doesn't smoke or drink. She doesn't have an exercise plan but stays active by playing with kids.

**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
Deborah loves making gardens from empty spaces. She once turned a concrete area into a garden, which was better than any workout. Writing for people who want to read her work gives her energy. She enjoys exploring nature, even if it's private land, because it feels fun and childlike.

**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**  
Katherine believes in doing things you care about. She likes taking risks and gets bored easily, which keeps her motivated. Doing things you don't like can make you tired. She used to be on committees but didn't enjoy it. She thinks it's important to use your energy on things that matter to you."
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until about 200 AD when iron skates came to Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was an important skill. 

In the early 1900s, skating was calm and stylish. But in the 1924 Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie made skating more athletic. This made skating more popular. Today, skating is a mix of art and sport. It is beautiful and also hard work.

When you start skating, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to stay balanced. Your body should lean a little forward. Relaxation is very important in skating.

To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It is not too hard, right? As you practice, you can make your movements bigger.

Learning how to fall is one of the first things skaters need to know. Even the best skaters fall. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.

Once you can skate confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basics. Soon, you can learn turns, jumps, and spins.

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, you should do exercises regularly. It is dangerous to skate with a stiff body. Warm-up exercises should include legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It is good for your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. If you also swim or jog, it is a great way to stay healthy and fit."
FCE_64,"**Trills and Medals**

Seeing a talented child win a medal can make you cry with happiness. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15**

Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard now. I don't have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gym and school. I try to take each training day by day. When I feel very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off because it makes you stiff.""

**B. Annika's Mother**

""Annika showed great talent from a young age. Some parents push their children, but it doesn't work. To perform like Annika, you have to want it yourself. People say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she has met people from all over the world and has the confidence of success.""

**C. Sarah Stokes**

Sarah started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my mum and dad like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love show-jumping events; they are exciting and fun. Even without Mum and Dad, I would do it because I am determined. I'm glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to join the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

**D. Sarah's Mother**

""Sarah loved horses from age 1. At 5, she got up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, you have to jump all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is well-organized and very happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is wonderful.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10**

Jane is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about being too proud. I don't talk about my success at school because I don't like feeling embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's Mother**

""Jane played her first chess game at 5. My father said, 'Let's see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to put her down because she is special. If she has this gift, let her use it."""
FCE_29,"Chris Greener was 14 years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?"" because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Now, Chris is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every ten years, people in Europe get about one centimeter taller. More tall people are being born each year. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are becoming like our ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Back then, people ate many different foods. Women collected herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants.

About 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Farmers grew wheat, rice, and maize, which now give us more than half of our calories. This diet was not good for our health. People became less healthy and smaller. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Corn caused tooth decay and diseases.

Farming spread because it could feed more people than hunting and gathering. But many people were not well-fed. Only recently have countries like Europe, the US, and Japan started eating better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

This increase in height has some problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less legroom in planes and trains. Clothes makers have to change their sizes. We cannot keep growing forever. Scientists think we might reach an average height of 193 cm this century.

However, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, people were rounder and taller to stay warm. Now, as the Earth gets warmer, we might become thinner and smaller. Global warming could make us shrink."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a normal part of TV, but many people don't understand them. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder, ""Who are these people?"" Some people think studio audiences are not very important. Even people who work in TV sometimes don't respect them. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be on TV for a short time. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of backgrounds and jobs. TV shows try to get different people for different shows.

Some people like to watch TV at home and don't understand why others go to a studio. Why would someone get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio to watch something they can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came because she might be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious about how TV shows are made. But most people said they came because a friend gave them a ticket.

Not many of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows signs that say ""APPLAUD"" or ""LAUGH,"" and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, ""We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a difference between watching in a studio and at home? Claire thinks sitting in a studio is ""more exciting,"" and Charlotte liked being part of live TV. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot."" I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night out."
FCE_9,"**Bruce**  
I don't like wild places without people. I like places with a human touch. When I travel, I like pretty villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to the village of Lastingham in a nice valley. Riding my bike helped me feel free from school. I loved exploring the high hills, quiet valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in a private diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which later became my job.

**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by people who love trains. I always travel first class because it doesn't cost much more. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But I always look forward to one part of the journey when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we can see people doing everyday things like making tea or washing dishes. I see myself as a woman in a small train, looking into other people's homes. I like the simple landscape. Just fields, sheep, and a faraway grey sea. It makes me look closely to find something special.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and quiet coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so not many people go there. Some brave surfers come, but most people like to think about the sea's beauty. The coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland through pretty valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple places with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. Not many people live or visit there. It's a quiet and empty place, and I like the feeling of space. I found the area by accident when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's my dream place. It's a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was excited because she found a pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We have a special tank for animals we find, so we can look at them and read about them in our nature book.

I came home late and started cooking. Suddenly, I heard my children shouting, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. Our cat, Domino, had caught Bianca, a white mouse that was a Mother's Day gift for me. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth. The room was full of furniture and children, and everyone was trying to catch Domino.

I tried to help and fell on the floor. Then I saw the snake. It was escaping from its tank. The snake was moving across the floor. The room was full of noise with the cat, mouse, kids, and even the dog barking. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and came back. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse. The mouse was wet but not hurt. This mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life.

After saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It was hard to catch. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, moving slowly. The snake finally relaxed. I carefully picked it up and took it to the garden. I wanted the snake to live in the garden shed. But when I let go of its head, the snake climbed over my shoulders like a scarf. It seemed to like me because I was warm.

My eldest child, DJ, said, ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" We all helped the snake move to the shed. Slowly, it went up the wall and over the roof. As the snake's tail disappeared, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Write me a letter! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, writing letters is disappearing. But for me, getting a letter is special. It is exciting to see who it is from and to read what it says. I have been writing letters for a long time. It started with small notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote a letter every week, and so did my mother. Sometimes my father wrote too, and his letters were funny and long. Most letters from home talked about everyday things. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters more. I also got letters from boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we wrote letters to stay in touch. Writing letters made our relationships better. I could say things in writing that were hard to say in person. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but a letter with a lot of news is better! It's even better when it comes in an airmail envelope with pretty stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend I trained with 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. There is a lady from France who writes to me. We met in a restaurant on holiday. My husband took her photo, and I asked for her address. If she hadn't replied, we wouldn't have become friends. Now we write to each other often. I can practice my French because she doesn't speak English. We have visited each other's homes. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer. My family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing for 29 years but never met. Everyone was surprised that we wrote for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it. I am happy my children are writing letters too. Like my mother, I make them write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, thanks to my penfriend. I hope people keep writing letters and don't let it become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

In the French Alps, there are many old pictures carved into rocks at Mont Bego. These pictures are very special and important. They are about 4,000 years old and show cows, fields, and gods. But now, these pictures are being damaged by tourists. 

Jean Clottes, an expert on rock art, says that if the damage continues, the pictures might be gone in 50 years. Tourists sometimes step on the drawings or even take pieces home. Some people rub the drawings to see them better, which also harms them. Others scratch their own names or pictures into the rocks.

Experts have different ideas on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the mountain should be closed to the public, except for guided tours. He believes this will save the site and help with research. But Jean Clottes disagrees because he thinks people living nearby will not like this idea.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says it is hard to stop people from damaging the area because it is very large. He suggests charging a fee to visit, but there is not enough money to hire guards.

Annie Echassoux, another researcher, is worried because tourists can now reach the site more easily. She thinks the area should be roped off and guides should be provided. She believes money must be found to protect the site because it is a historic place. If nothing is done, future generations might lose these important drawings."
FCE_32,"**Shopping with Children**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not a new sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can't buy all this, and I feel bad if I give in and buy unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset before we even leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things. They don't find reasons like ""sugar is bad for your teeth"" convincing when they see fun and exciting ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. Even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' they still want that result.""

Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son is critical of ads, and they look at labels together. She says, ""I've talked so much that he thinks all ads are rubbish. We don't fight in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't buy.""

Parents also say they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children are not with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring more customers."
FCE_65,"Title: Climbing Walls

In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, inside or outside. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. He is hanging upside down by his fingers. This event is at the National Indoor Arena, which is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both events have a big wall for climbing.

Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they climbed in cold places like Scotland. But climbers needed to stay fit all year. So, they started using brick walls to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong.

Soon, sports centers began building special climbing walls. These walls had bricks with special edges to hold on to. Don Robinson, a teacher, made one of the first climbing walls at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock set in concrete for the wall.

In the 1970s, many climbing walls were built in sports halls. But these walls had problems. They were only straight up and down, unlike real cliffs with different shapes. Also, once built, they couldn't be changed, so climbers got bored.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material for climbing holds. These could be put on and taken off walls easily. French companies also started using steel frames for walls. Steel is lighter than concrete, so it was easier to make walls with different shapes. This gave climbers many new ways to climb."
FCE_61,"Text: 'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky.' Acting is a risky job because there are more actors than jobs. When you decide to be an actor, some friends might say you are crazy, but others might not. Everyone will give you different advice. It is your choice, and you are responsible for your dream. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee you will succeed after training. It takes luck and talent. But there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous. Sometimes, it can also be rewarding. People often ask what talent is. Talent is natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. Talent also involves courage and belief in what you do. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain. In theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and others' skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes, or waitressing. Then, you get an audition, but you might not get the job. Actors do not talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes rejection. Remember, rejection can happen from the first time you try for a part. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented. It is up to you because if you do not care, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_28,"Chris Greener was 14 years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?"" because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Now, Chris is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain.

Every ten years, people in Europe get about one centimeter taller. More tall people are being born each year. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are now eating better, which helps us grow to our full height. Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago.

In the past, people got food from many places. Women collected herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants. But 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers grew wheat, rice, and maize, which now give us more than half of our calories. This diet was not good for our health. People became less healthy and smaller. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Corn caused more tooth decay and diseases.

Farming spread because it could feed more people than hunting and gathering. But many people were not well-fed and stayed small. Only recently have richer countries like Europe, the US, and Japan started eating better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

This is good, but it also causes problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less legroom in planes and trains. Clothes makers have to change their sizes. We cannot keep growing forever. Robert Fogel from the University says we might grow to 193 cm this century.

However, scientists say that while individuals are getting taller, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, people were rounder and taller to stay warm. Now, as the climate gets warmer, we are getting thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might shrink even more."

FCE_5,"**Two Brothers and Their Game**

Dave and Norm Lagasse are two brothers in their forties with big beards. They live in a simple house in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are playing a game from their childhood called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family played it often on weekends and holidays. When they moved to New Mexico, they kept playing the game. Visitors were curious because the game was not known in the southern USA.

Three years ago, Dave saw that their old pichenotte board was broken. He decided to make a new one. It was very nice, and soon family and friends wanted one too. The brothers took a board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people thought the game looked silly, but once they started playing, they loved it.

Dave learned that the game might have started in India as 'carroms'. It changed into 'squails' in Britain and then became pichenotte in Quebec, Canada. Pichenotte is a game for two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces called 'pucks'. You flick the pucks with your finger across a board. If you get a puck into a small hole, you score 20 points. There are also rings worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game lasts about two minutes.

The game became popular in Santa Fe. The brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. They even started a championship with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. They sell for $595 on the brothers' website.

There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope the game will make them rich. For now, they enjoy playing the game they love."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you come to the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land with lots of wild plants. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with help from his wife, worked very hard to make it beautiful. They moved a lot of soil and clay to change the flat land into the nice shapes you see today. Machines helped, but there was also a lot of hard work by hand. They brought in about 1,000 tonnes of good soil to make the grass, flower beds, and rock gardens.

Many trees and bushes were planted. They had to choose plants that could live near the sea and in strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden shops, but some came from far places like Canada and New Zealand.

Colin Sims thought of the Model Village. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, special wood, and plastic to last in all weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about materials, but soon he became an expert too.

You will see that all models are made to the same size scale, with lots of detail. This took a lot of patience and special building methods. The Model Village is very popular because of its high quality. The building methods are now used in other model villages in England and are taught in some schools.

The model buildings show traditional British styles. One of the best is the Manor House, a 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It looks like manor houses in the West Country. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is new.

Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models. If you fall, it can take us a long time to fix the models. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.

To enjoy your visit more, you can press buttons in front of some models to make them move. At the end of your visit, we would like to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us. Tell us if you think any models are not as good as the others. We keep updating the models and need to know which ones need fixing.

We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village."
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules that newspaper editors should follow. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people because they show private moments on the front page. However, not many people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC is an organization that deals with these problems. These pictures are rarely important for the public. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress was upset about these pictures before. She was in a hotel, a place where she should expect privacy, so she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. The PCC did not investigate, which is surprising. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC do something about these attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers and TV would report these decisions. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would stop publishing such material. Even photographers would stop taking these pictures because it would not be worth it. If the PCC acted like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue? Also, famous people might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC watch all British newspapers and magazines? There is also the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want more embarrassment from an investigation? Most people probably want to forget about it and move on. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story they want to keep secret, and they fear it might come out if they complain. In this way, even the PCC might seem like the enemy. A British comedian also had problems with the press. He and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He didn't complain then or later when his family was photographed on holiday. He was afraid the newspaper would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger. They might say it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but many learned it over time. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**

When I finished school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. At 25, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous but did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was scared on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.

**B. Michaela**

Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and acted too aggressive. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too hard, I don't feel bad about leaving some tasks for the next day. When things are difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to calm down.

**C. Lisa**

People think I'm confident, but when I look calm, I'm actually scared. In TV, looking confident is important. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous. My mom once told me, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone is worried about themselves."" This helps me. You gain confidence by doing things that scare you. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt less scared.

**D. Barbara**

I enjoy my work, which makes me confident. I've built confidence over the years. If you learn from mistakes, you become more confident. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You should like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses, which help my confidence. Setting small goals helps me see my progress.

**E. Kim**

After college, I worked as a secretary. In meetings, I was too scared to speak up. I finally got the confidence to share my ideas. In politics, I was nervous speaking in public. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing notes helped me feel better. Everyone gets nervous speaking in public. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""

'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He showed me a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a line of competitors waited for the start. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person entered four different kites, judged on decoration, stability, and flying skill. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them needs real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into mountains with thick rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. Nearby, a sign pointed up a path into the forest: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' I didn't know the path was steep and slippery. When I got there, a man with a flask of tea was waiting. This was Baba, who took care of a kitchen and bamboo huts. I decided to stay, trying not to think about insects under my mattress. The night was very dark and full of sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many animals moved and made noises. In the morning, I saw a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning hit the treetops. I got very wet. Going downhill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car being washed away. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the path. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' They were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I remember it for the kindness of its people.'"

For a group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are for learning how to cook. Their cooking classes are very popular, and 30 children are waiting to join. Parents pay £280 for the course where children can have fun and learn to make good food. Bill, who is ten years old, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.' Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum said I should have a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't sure at first. But now I'm happy I came.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, but the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will know how to cook for themselves when they leave home.''"

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? Money, like the pound, the dollar, or the euro, is similar to a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that is cheap to make. 

A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, who was a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each having something the other wanted. 

Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' so people could trade more easily. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

PET_27,"Grass

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different kinds of grass, and you can find them everywhere on Earth. Grass is the only flowering plant that can live in the very cold places like the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. Unlike other plants, new grass leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so there is always food."

Since she was a child, she liked drawing clothes and making patterns. Her parents own a supermarket, and she never told them she wanted to make fashion her job. She thought they wanted her to work in a more traditional business, so she studied management at university. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to go to events but couldn't buy expensive designer clothes. So, she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs. Her clothes sold well, and nothing was returned. This success made her leave her job in advertising. She took a loan of PS20,000 and started her own women's clothing brand. Kal's parents were not upset about her new career and said they would support her, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than PS500,000. Her designs are in fashion magazines, and she makes clothes for pop stars. Winning the award gave her public recognition. Kal feels very lucky and says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

The hotel is on a main road that goes to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes by bus to get to the center. Buses to many parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Be careful not to take buses with the blue sign ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is an underground station less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the corridors. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. You can park your car at the hotel. Free newspapers are available, and you can buy stamps at the office.

Guests staying for a long time must pay weekly in advance and give one week's notice before leaving. Both short and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first. Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9.30 am; lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm; dinner from 5.30 pm to 7 pm.

PET_49,"Text: 'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north coast through a big desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. People wanted a train from Darwin to Adelaide for a long time. In the 1920s, they built a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but there was often flooding, making it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on the train is very good. The railway was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south through Darwin and the train, instead of by ship, would save time and money. It is not every day a big railway is finished, and the Ghan says it is the world's first north-south one. As I waited to get on the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the trip. Most of the travelers were older Australians, and they were eager to board. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the Ghan waited for four hours. Some passengers got off and took a boat trip up the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group just walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and even though the train might not have given everything the ads promised, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.'"
PET_31,"Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We went up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high and is probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is very hard, like ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we took a lot of safety equipment, like lights to get attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path soon went up, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but when I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that next time I would train better before a climb. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops down hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly. After seven hours of climbing, we got to the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we were not lucky because there was mist. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt happy when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we moved to our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. But this new school is special because it is very good for the environment. It took many months to build, and we watched it happen. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but it was sad to lose some nice open space. The building machines were very noisy, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of heavy rain. We thought the building might never be finished.

Now, we have five very big classrooms, much bigger than in our old school, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We can't wait to use them when our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps all the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound inside. When we sing, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is the tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday. It spins very fast and is so big that you can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are using the new school, some parts are not finished yet. For example, we are doing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if you turn a shark over on its back, it can stop moving.

I'm Nathalie. Last year, I joined the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. I was one of the youngest foreign students. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they spoke English, so we could talk. Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. 

For the first two weeks, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. One night, I called home because I felt lonely. The classes in Russia are harder than in England, and I eat a lot to have enough energy. This helps me perform well. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the film ends. Now, I feel at home here. I like walking around the city and visiting shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was not very cold for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy.

PET_55,"The ICEHOTEL

For many years, people liked to visit the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in winter, only a few people lived there with the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people thought the cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an art show in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in a small town called Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This place, called Arctic Hall, brought many visitors. One night, some guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. They enjoyed it, and this gave the idea for an ice hotel. Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous around the world.

When winter starts, snow builders, architects, and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is ready, it opens to visitors and guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and new parts open each week until January 7th, when the hotel is finished. The hotel is built outside with natural winter materials, so the finish date can change because of the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it is colder outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the price for guests. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, a scarf, and many wool socks. Shoes should be bigger than normal to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these when you book your visit, and they will be in your room when you arrive.

The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

About 6,000 people came to the shop. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours on the first day. However, it had to close in just half an hour. A police officer said: 'We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait quietly. Also, there was a long line of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained the situation. It wasn't safe, so they had to close. I will come back when they open again, but I don't want to wait in line again.'"

PET_34,"Text: 'Free-diving in the Caribbean Tanya Streeter is very good at free-diving. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean with just one breath. Tanya holds four world records in this sport. In 2003, she became the first person to dive 120 meters deep and come back up without help. Before that, she used a balloon to help her come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. She was the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive to make sure she was safe. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents, but Tanya says safety and training are very important. Tanya trains a lot. She spends most of her time training on land in the gym. She also trains in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. When she practices diving, she usually goes away from home. She does fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day after each dive. Rest is important so she does not get too tired. When Tanya is not training, she talks to people about sports products and helps environmental groups. She grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman and loved swimming and exploring rock pools as a child. Tanya says her life now is like her childhood dreams. She is famous in some countries, so people listen to her about the environment. Tanya is in her thirties and wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and plans to continue for many years.'"
PET_12,"CARTOON FILMS

Cartoon films can do many things. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the movie screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons fun again for everyone. In the late 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for kids. But then, some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and kids could enjoy cartoons together. Not all cartoon films were good. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well. It was too scary for kids and too simple for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again."
PET_26,"Title: New TV Star Caroline Benson Talks About Her First TV Role

Caroline Benson is a new TV star. She talks about her first TV role. She says, ""I never thought I would spend my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I only acted in school plays before, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother always said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I imagined playing her. 

Before university, I took a year off to travel. When I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She said they wanted to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director. She convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. 

Filming started a week after university began, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to write the essays I missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky. 

After university, I want to be an actress. My family is not in acting, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I tried for other TV roles but haven't got any offers yet. I don't know how I did everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I didn't know what to do. I have been in two college plays since then. I haven't been home much, and now my first year at university is over. I'm going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It has water and sugars. Bees can travel up to 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than 300 types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually tastes milder than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey a lot and even used it as money. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help prevent tiredness and improve sports performance. Honey is not just food; it can also help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. People have lived in Norwich for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By 1066, during the Norman invasion, it was one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th birthday. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city with a Royal Charter, which allowed it to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. But in the 16th century, it was the second biggest city in England. It grew for 300 years and became rich, known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a modern business center, especially for insurance services. Norwich offers many entertainment options like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centers. It also has a football team called 'The Canaries,' with green and yellow colors.

Norwich has a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall.' To build it, workers dug a big hole in the city for over two years. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. People in Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping center. Both the market and the Mall are popular, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new things."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, becomes full of bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, there were about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries are expected at the festival's current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots of the balloons talk to each other using radios and light up their balloons at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow' and is a great chance to take amazing photos. You need to arrive just after it gets dark or before 5:30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, and some look like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies offering flights. Another option is to take a cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere, and you can see the festival from above. There are many other things to do for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a special wind pattern that is perfect for flying balloons. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control where their balloons go by moving up or down.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets online before you go to avoid long lines at the festival. Wear several layers of thin clothes. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, bring your camera. If you are not using a digital camera, you will need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. Since it opened, it has become one of the most popular places for tourists in the UK. When you first see it, the big 'biospheres' look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. This shows visitors how important the connection between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many things we use every day come from plants, like wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. There are over 135,000 different types of plants here. Even if it is cold outside, electric heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. Another zone has the climate of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. There are also plans to make a desert zone soon."

Margaret lives in London and likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who are very interested. She started teaching the violin in 1972, and her first class was with her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson is one hour long, every two weeks. Each student also has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons. From the first lessons, students learn to play by listening. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin with more traditional methods."

Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. The first song on the CD is a dance song, showing that the band is not focusing on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder. Most of the other songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. They could become popular because they are very good. Singer Rob Letchford sings very well on this CD. Fans should be happy he recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. (People who bought tickets do not need to worry because all the concerts will be rescheduled when Rob is better.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from slow songs to ones that make you want to dance. I think the best songs are at the beginning, and the last few songs are not as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' will likely be very popular and bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was found by people traveling on land, not by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made money by owning banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

PET_33,"The History of Shoes

In the past, people did not care if shoes were comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles when it was cold. We still use leather today, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton, depending on what is popular. 

About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either the left or right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand. Now, most shoes are made by machines in big factories, but some shoemakers still make shoes by hand. Sewing machines helped the shoe industry make many shoes quickly and sell them at lower prices."

I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. They wanted to lose weight, but I don't think they thought much about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined hard training. They didn't think about running and talking with friends in nice places, like by a river. At first, they ran for only one minute.

PET_40,"**The History of the Iditarod - The Last Great Race on Earth**

In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there to find gold and become rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew very fast and became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In summer, boats could bring important things to these towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, so boats could not travel. In 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes started to be used instead.

In 1925, a disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and people were not sure if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot, Carl Eielson, was not there. So, they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine. The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to finish the trip.

Leonhard Seppala, a man from Norway, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow. Togo was a good guide. The last part of the trip was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto stopped and saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, there is a dog sled race every year from Anchorage to Nome. It follows the same path as the 1925 journey. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

He went to see her and found her playing football outside the club. He saw that she was very fast. ""He talked to me about athletics. I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" But Jose talked to her parents and convinced them that Maria could be successful and help their family. They agreed to let him take her to train.

In 1991, Maria finally agreed to train in the United States. She had said no before because she would miss her family. Her life was different from the girls she met in the US. She says, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They didn't know much about me or my problems.

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from other local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, but some bands wore bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were used to playing in competitions. The music was amazing, especially because we are all young. Players from each band even made new tunes on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played!

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play can join. Only about half of the students get accepted. But anyone who really wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot.

Adults are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music is not challenging enough for serious music students like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can create your own music, but you also feel part of its history, like the great jazz performers before you.

My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we wouldn't get far with our music!"

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

**About the Flights**

During the short Antarctic summer, we take tourists on a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica, and back. We don't know the exact flight dates for next year yet, but if you book now, you can change the date later if needed.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight is about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and then fly back home. During the flight, experts who have lived in Antarctica talk about the environment and history. You can also see what the pilot sees through a camera linked to the video system.

**Will I get a window seat?**

All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will change seats. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half of the flight. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half of the flight. While over Antarctica, you can walk around the plane to see the sights. The pilot flies in a special way so everyone can see well.

**What if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different flight plans. The captain checks the weather on the morning of the flight and chooses the best route for clear views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most wildlife is at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them well. We do not land in Antarctica to protect the environment. To see wildlife, you would need to take a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can take photos. We also have some fun photo opportunities on the plane where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are for learning how to cook. Their cooking classes are very popular, and 30 children are waiting to join. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.' 

Flora is twelve, and she finds it hard to cut onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum said I should find a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't sure at first. But now I'm really happy I came.'

Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, but the kitchen is not always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will know how to cook for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Winter Driving

Winter driving is dangerous because it is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly when you go over a hill. Ice can hide under melting snow and make you slide off the road. A car coming towards you might slide across the road. 

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick movements can make your car hard to control. When you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you do not spill it.

Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further you need to look down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. 

In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law but decided to go to art school instead. At art school, he found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. He liked early Italian artists, and this shows in his work. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. To do this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark. He says he never knows how the painting will look in the end. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself.' Aitchison makes painting sound easy. 'Anyone can use colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors go next to each other.' He does not make drawings before painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes models who do not ask to see their pictures while he is painting them. 'If they want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he does not follow any tradition and just paints the way he can. But his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we didn't want to buy it because it would be noisy. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Drums are hard to move, so Ben's band friends started coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. For a few hours each week, our house is very loud with their music and singing. 

At least Ben's hobby is good for our health. When the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music sounds a bit strange, they are nice and polite young men. I can't say if they are good musicians because I didn't expect my parents to like my music when I was a teenager. But they do play in local clubs for young people.

Our main worry is that they might not spend enough time on their school work because of the band, but this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is sure - Ben was right: it keeps him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a very good private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives young people important experiences outside the classroom. Students can also study for their exams there. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from all over the world. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do helpful activities like working on a farm, helping people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

Atlantic College students come from many different countries and social backgrounds. Not many can pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants to help. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them get help from the government to attend.

""I really admire the college for trying to help young people understand each other,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don't like them. During the summer holidays, my mother was surprised because I argued less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College gives its students a great education with methods that really work."
PET_47,"Title: Being an Older Student

I am 32 years old and just finished my first year at university. I go to lectures often, read books quickly, and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. Before, I worked as a secretary. I made good money, but I was bored because I did not have to think much. I felt sad because I thought I would stay in that job forever. I was jealous of the students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be part of that.

Now, I am a student, but it is hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am happy to study because I need a qualification to get a good job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I like spending weekends with my books more than going to parties. I also enjoy student benefits like long holidays and discounts at the theatre and cinema. Sometimes, I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good decision."
PET_48,"Henry Ford

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cheap cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. He soon sold 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant less choice. Henry Ford said about the Model T, 'You can have any color you like, as long as it's black.'"

Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane, and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he went on short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather came in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They didn't come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them.

Each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they do not get too hot. 

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot, so people did not want to buy sweaters. Then, she made some socks. Everyone loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started. 

At first, she made the socks at home. But soon, she had many customers. She had to send the wool to a factory. Now, all the socks are made by machines. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favorite present.

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave a door or a window open. He reported that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help is free.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit to eat. This meant that people moved all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages slowly got bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and then some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes.'"

Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they do not earn as much money.

Today, there are police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London did not have any police. A few old men watched the city streets at night, but they did not get much money for it. About 300 years ago, London started to grow. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, so people stayed at home as much as they could.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to catch thieves. They were like police officers and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more police officers. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force started with 3000 officers. Most of the men walked, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are paid well, and the few police officers who still ride horses get even better pay than the others."

This year, there are over five hundred shows with actors from more than forty countries. The tickets are not very expensive, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be hard to find a room, so book your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will find Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake turns to ice, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here every year for twenty-five years. He says, 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet some nice people here!'"

To: Anna  

Hi Anna,  

I'm not having a good week! Yesterday, my team played a volleyball match, but we lost. The other team played better than us. Then my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called me with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he has a summer job. We can't go camping together now. And this morning, my sister woke up late, so she took my bike to school! She didn't tell me she needed it. I'm really angry with her. I hope you have some good news! Write back today if you can.

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

Madame Tussaud's museum is a very famous place for tourists in London. In this museum, people can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle was a doctor who made wax figures of people. He opened a museum with these figures in Paris. Marie helped her uncle with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie went to prison. There, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, like Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and you can still see her figures today."
KET_14,"BICYCLES

A bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive, and only rich people could buy them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought them. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles because cars are much faster, and you don't get wet when it rains! But some people still like to cycle to work. They say there are too many cars in town centers, and you can't find anywhere to park!"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we wanted to see the elephant show. We went to a big area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a big white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its card. Sometimes, the keepers gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, the elephants painted pictures by following their keepers' instructions. I was amazed! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there, but the smartest elephants live in special places where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Big Cats

There are many kinds of big cats. They are different in size and do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers often lie in water when it is hot!

Lions are the only cats that live in big family groups. Many lions work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and follow other animals easily.

All cats need good eyes because they catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong."
KET_36,"Dear Mrs. Brian,

I am sorry, but I can't come to your class anymore because I have to go back to my country. My sister is getting married next month. I want to go shopping with her to choose a dress. My parents will make a big meal for the guests, and there will be a lot of work in the kitchen. I am sorry I have to leave the English class. You are a very good teacher. Please say goodbye to the other students for me. Thank you again.

Best wishes,

KET_33,"Dear Lorna,

How are you? I'm happy because I got a new job last month in the city center. I work in a Tourist Information Office, and it is very interesting. I start work every morning at 7:30, so I have to get up very early! I love this job because I meet people from many different countries. I like telling them about our city. Here is a photo of me. I'm wearing my new uniform. Do you like it?

KET_20,"The Ostrich

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Ostriches have wings like all birds, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometers an hour, so it is hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and need about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water."
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson is from Britain and started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. Now, she is 23 and has won many snowboarding competitions. We talked to her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland. We asked her why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I have always liked sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding was a natural choice. It doesn't take long to learn, and you can become really good in a few months.""

We also asked if she practices a lot. She said, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. I love doing all these activities! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because they are so beautiful. But the best thing for me is free-riding, which means snowboarding for fun when there is no competition.""

We asked her what is important when learning to snowboard. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you fall down a lot!"""

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. People say the Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, so it can stay underwater for a few minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, and many fish and insects died, so otters had nothing to eat. But today, there is a lot of food for them because the rivers are clean again.'"

KET_59,"People have always made buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We use museums to keep beautiful things. Many people work together to make a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures of it. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers build it carefully. The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a nice roof. It looks beautiful from every side, not just the top. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a famous roof. This building looks like a glass tent."

KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England. They are close to each other. Between these towns, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a picture of a very big man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the village next to him is called Cerne. Nobody knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think it was a long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to see the picture. If you go on the first of May when the sun rises, you will see people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.'"
KET_61,"Gail Rollins

Gail Rollins is a very good runner from Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run in the 10,000 meters and maybe the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. Before, Gail was famous for finishing second in big races. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for this.

Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, which is a very long race. She won and had the fastest time of the year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also used to race when he was younger. But he had to stop because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him.

Gail trains hard. She runs a long distance in the morning and does fast runs in the afternoon. But she always rests from running on Sundays. Mike says, 'I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, ""Are you sure you should eat that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.'"
KET_52,"**Piano Players - When They Were Young**

**Ivan Petrov**

Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. His mother started teaching him piano when he was six. At ten, he wanted to write music and soon began his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**

Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who liked playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he started piano lessons with a teacher in his city. Oleg quickly began to win prizes for playing the piano. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Later, he returned to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**

Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two. A year later, he started playing the piano. He gave his first concert at six. At ten, he played fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef always liked music but was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now but wants to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith

Bill Prince-Smith did many jobs before he started writing children's books at 60 years old. He was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist. Now, 13 years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. Bill says, 'She tells me if she doesn't like something.' His ten grandchildren do not live close, but they also read his stories and say if they are good or bad. This helps Bill understand what young children like to read.

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms nearby. His favorite book is his fifth one: The Sheepdog. It is about a farmer and his dog that helps him. Bill says, 'I have always liked animals, and dogs are very smart. They learn quickly.' Last year, The Sheepdog was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used new computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes film-makers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film,' he says."
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles on them. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures of news events, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures then.'"
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, long before there were any people on Earth. We don't know exactly why they all died. Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest were larger than any other animals that lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run fast because it had long back legs.'"

Like most animals, they use their noses to find food. There are seven kinds of bears. The biggest is the white polar bear, which is almost three meters tall. There are two kinds of black bears. One kind lives in the forests of North America, and the other kind lives in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black. They can be dark brown or reddish brown. Many people love the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is hard to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm places in the world, like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You can often see many crocodiles together in big groups. They eat anything they catch, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they eat big animals or even people. There are more than ten kinds of crocodiles. All crocodiles have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles can live for a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo was 66 years old."
KET_17,"Text: 'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon that could carry people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers made the first plane with an engine and flew it. This happened in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"

The queen loved going to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to watch plays by William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors ate, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the 1600s.'"
