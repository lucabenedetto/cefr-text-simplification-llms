CPE_15,"Text: Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have their rubbish collected regularly. They put their rubbish in bags or bins, and a special truck takes it away to a landfill. Economists find this strange because it seems free. Families pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, getting rid of rubbish is not free. The more rubbish there is, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The simple solution is to make families pay for the amount of rubbish they throw away. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming there are places to recycle. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea has complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study, they looked at a scheme in Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents paid 80 cents for each tagged bag. This seemed like a good use of market forces. However, the authors found that the benefits did not cover the costs of the scheme. The number of bags did fall by 37%, but this was because people crammed more rubbish into each bag by jumping on it. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%. In other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying. This is hard to measure, but the authors think illegal dumping might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. One positive result was a 15% increase in recycling, suggesting people chose to recycle instead of paying for rubbish collection. But the fee might not be the main reason for more recycling, as many people were already recycling voluntarily. In another study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices cuts rubbish by only 0.3%. This is lower than in other studies, but not surprising. To reduce rubbish a lot, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important as price. In richer towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time to recycle. Should we think charging for rubbish is a bad idea? Not at all. Free disposal is too cheap. But simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because if your skills make you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you are too busy to learn new things or be creative, then no amount of money or status will make up for not being a well-rounded person.

Zeldin wants to find out how work can help us grow as people, instead of just shaping us to fit industrial needs. Work should not only be about making money but also about living a fulfilling life, discovering new talents, and meeting different people. However, this does not mean getting rid of unemployment is the only goal. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful. Work should be like a piece of art, with a happy person at its center.

Even traditional jobs like doctors, accountants, and architects are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, and architects rarely get to be creative. Middle managers are losing confidence in their roles. Companies and public institutions are getting smaller, and new ideas like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance have not made employees more committed. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match their organization's values.

Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He looks at how different cultures have expanded what humans can do and how courage can be developed. He is interested in happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now he is focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts work on making companies last longer and earn more money, but we also need to think about what kind of people we want to be and who we want to spend our time with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us feel like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many smart and lively people work in hotels but have low prestige, low pay, and long hours. Hotels have not changed much since the days of the Ritz, with its old idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from all over the world meet, but often do not talk to each other. Many hotel staff are foreigners who want to learn a new language and culture, but they have little interaction with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. They could use the skills of the students they hire, instead of giving them only simple tasks. If hotels paid attention to their staff's dreams, they could offer many more services. But accountants often say hotels should focus on one main activity to make the most money.

Zeldin believes work is about relationships. People want jobs that let them be independent and express themselves. They should be able to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, as long as it is practical and profitable. This means they need to communicate well with people from different fields. Communication is important, but real conversation is different. It is a deeper connection that creates respect and can change people. Every meaningful conversation can change the world a little bit."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents the hope of modern times. It suggests planned growth and success if conditions are right. Broadcasting assumes there is a central source, like a bucket of seeds, ready to spread information widely.

The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a two-way communication tool. But from the start, it was seen as a one-way, mass communication tool. Sending broadcasts from a central place to homes matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of organizing television were tried but did not last.

Two interesting alternatives to traditional broadcasting deserve mention. In the early 1930s in Britain, radio enthusiasts experimented with two-way television, similar to a telephone. Magazines like Radio News explained how to build TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these hobbyists out. This ended the chance for television to develop as a grassroots, equal form of communication in Britain.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structure of modern societies. In the USA in the early 1930s, television was mainly used for public shows and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, most people watched TV in public places. The idea of two-way, amateur television was not successful, but public viewing of TV was common in several countries in the 1930s. However, this did not stop the move towards home television.

Manufacturers saw the potential for selling TVs to homes once prices dropped. As working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s, the dream of having entertainment at home became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening worldwide. There is a link between social changes and how broadcasting is organized. As societies became more modern, power and money became more centralized, and traditional communities broke up. People moved more, both socially and geographically, leading to more isolated lives.

Centralized broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of national community. This made broadcasting the main way to organize radio and TV. Broadcasting also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information needed for political and social participation.

Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If that happens, the idea of broadcasting will be seen as a way of organizing technology during a certain time in social history."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can get out of control. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much ads affect you, try not to read any billboards next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads try to convince us to buy things in ways we don't even notice. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet, and more—all telling us to buy, buy, buy.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves. They look at how caves are formed, how water moves through them, and the life inside them. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, and they make us curious. Because of this, a lot of research has been done on them. In some parts of the world, caves have been important to how people live, so they have been studied even more. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**  
Many people who watched the weather without any tools helped start the science of meteorology. Since the 17th century, it has become a very technical science. Today, satellites and electronic tools send us weather information quickly, and computers solve difficult math problems faster than humans can. Meteorology uses many long words that are hard to understand for most people. But simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience is key to turning computer data into weather forecasts. People’s observations can still give important information to help professionals understand the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I thought opera was mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the words and the actors are the focus. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.

At musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including me, might not understand music technically. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A great singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match. We know athletes do something similar to us when we run, but they do it much better.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems like what they could do. They don't usually admire an actor for remembering long speeches, though they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more or less demanding than music audiences. Many people go to both. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how difficult the play is.

Should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes. Music performances are full of emotion and can be very theatrical. But the way music is presented, with strict dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists, can make the difference between performers and audiences feel too big. Also, when audiences clap between movements or after a great performance, it can interrupt the flow of the music.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to bring new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience and life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.

I wish music had more of the risk and excitement that theatre can have. Sometimes this comes from using unusual locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists into unexpected places. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. But I believe music conventions can and should change.

I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, but I don't like it much in its natural form. For me, sand is a problem that lies between the car park at the beach and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong water spray. But here's the funny thing: as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off you. For days, you keep finding sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand comes out when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. No, I don't like sand at all.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security since they first started building houses. The simple wooden bar behind the door has changed to an electronic lock that uses a plastic card with many combinations. But the need to keep out the 'bad guys' is still there. Locks and keys are comforting to people. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locks, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't like them much. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a real key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company made a new electronic system, they included a real metal key in it.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I don't understand modern art well. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have opinions on more things. But you're not supposed to think about it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, real labels that explain the art and tell you what it means. Instead of just staring at the pictures without understanding, these bits of information helped me get it."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When books are turned into movies, a lot of the story is cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also be interesting. While working on a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still keep the main idea. This doesn't mean the original book had unnecessary parts. It's about how each type of storytelling, like books or movies, needs different things from the audience. In books, certain details, like character traits or who is speaking, are repeated to help the reader understand. In plays, which are mostly dialogue, the way people talk can be very realistic or very stylized. Sometimes, the dialogue is so full of extra words that it's hard to know what's really being said.

**Watching Movies**

When you watch a movie, you can feel like you're part of the story. It's an experience that takes you away from real life for a while. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. In the past, some people thought movies were just for fun and not a real art form. They liked watching movies but didn't think they were as important as other arts.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were no clear signs or main entrance. There were three main entrances, but only one led to where you wanted to go. It was confusing for visitors, but the people who worked there knew their way around. These workers helped create movies that brought excitement and adventure to people, letting them escape from their everyday problems for a few hours.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores have many guides on how to write scripts and make films. Universities offer courses, and there are contests to win cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his film El Mariachi. This film cost $7,000 and made him famous. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his first big film before he turned 25. In the past, filmmakers took longer to succeed. They learned by working in different jobs like editing or writing. Directors like John Huston and Fred Zinnemann made their first big films later in life. Today, without the support of big studios, new filmmakers have to be independent and creative."
CPE_3,"In those days, the council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of small, dull houses made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulfur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. 

I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, I have other memories, like faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, and snow falling over the big mansion at Earlham. 

My mother often appears in these early memories. She was a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I noticed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, alone even in a room full of people. She also had strict rules about how to behave, which was unusual in West Earlham. This sometimes led to intense cleaning or telling me to 'behave properly.' I didn't understand these rules, and even now, I'm not sure I do. 

For example, it meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules. Over time, other people appeared in these early memories. Despite her loneliness, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and not fully approved by the others. Later, I realized that this group was not very cheerful. They often talked about their health, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I was part of. 

Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders. I felt I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. But this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat in an armchair. Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. Some lucky children had a mother with a bike and a child seat. I think my mother let other children in the street take me to school. 

If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays. During these times, I saw glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house far away, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and talked about something called the League of Pity, a junior charity. But my mother dismissed it, saying they just wanted money. My mother often talked about people wanting money, and she had a low opinion of politicians. She thought of the House of Commons as a place where rich people took money from the public. 

I might be exaggerating, and I might not be fair to my mother. But she didn't show much kindness. However, she did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes,' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn't mind this activity and even started to have opinions about the paintings. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. It was getting dark, and the air was thick and wet, making my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well since I was a child. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, who were all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Even if I didn't know everyone by name, each house was special to me, like the little rain channels in the sidewalk that I used to skate over. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed a bit less fancy, with lower porches and smaller front yards. Over time, some things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these spaces that used to be shops.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brick and big doors. But Gilbert didn't want an open space because it was hard to separate work from home life. So, he used a large plastic sheet to create a hallway and hide his office. This also led the eye to the kitchen, which he wanted to be a neutral area for both cooking and meeting clients. To balance the modern look of his flat, he used light wood floors and added some sentimental furniture from his parents and markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin was a writer known for his adventurous life and mysterious stories. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was exciting and imaginative, mixing real events with fiction to make the stories more interesting. Chatwin believed that through travel, one could discover fascinating histories.

**Swimming**

One summer, during a heavy rain, I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles on the water, and the storm was so loud it drowned out the birds. It was then, in 1996, that I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in a pool. Many places today are clearly marked and explained, but activities like walking, cycling, and swimming let us explore and find mystery. A swimming journey would help me connect with the wild and unknown parts of the world."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose in evolution. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps create a bond between mother and child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the way it looks. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also happen for other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, and this often happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it change our lives? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but no one is sure about its effects. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are important.

The problem is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. In the last 100 years, human activities have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate now and will continue to do so. We know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years, showing they are related. Evidence suggests the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research uses computer models to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. These models use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climate factors. However, they are not perfect and can be slow and costly. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know they are complex. Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. Predictions suggest the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C by 2100, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common.

These changes could affect where plants and animals live, the mix of species, and the benefits they provide to humans. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects might be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts could be positive. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952 because there are fewer frosts.

However, many future effects of climate warming are not good. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry areas or places with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed. Another problem is changes to glaciers, which will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making it easier for marine transport and oil exploration but increasing iceberg dangers.

The most visible effect of global warming could be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and melting ice adds more water. With about half of the world's population living near coasts, rising sea levels could cause severe problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island countries could disappear if the worst happens, affecting their people and culture and putting pressure on other countries to help displaced people."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This is the type of people needed for the first trip to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to send a spacecraft on 5 January 2018 actually happen. The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, because saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are in the right position for a launch is in 2031. It is a big challenge, and new technologies need to be developed quickly. If everything is ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it doesn't launch, the work done to reach these goals will help future space missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the very existence of art makes it hard to understand what art really means. Artworks like buildings, books, paintings, or statues are often seen as just physical objects. People often forget that the real art is what these objects do to our experiences and feelings. This misunderstanding makes it difficult to truly understand art.

Some artworks are so admired and perfect that they create fixed ideas, which can block new ways of thinking about them. When an artwork becomes a classic, it often gets separated from the human experiences and conditions that created it. This separation makes it hard to see the true meaning of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often put in a special category, away from other human activities and achievements.

The main job for someone who wants to write about the philosophy of art is to connect art with everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. To understand art, we need to look at everyday experiences that we don't usually think of as art. We need to take a different path to understand art.

For example, you can enjoy flowers without knowing how they grow. But to understand flowers, you need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art, we need to start with everyday events and scenes that catch our attention and give us joy.

Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without thinking of them as art. When art is only seen in museums and galleries, people look for enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who disagree with the idea of art being only in museums often still separate art from everyday life. The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team. In the evening light, a group of quiet lions suddenly appears and surrounds their prey. Lions seem like perfect social animals, working together for a common goal, which is their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we started our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare away rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its young survive, then working together might not always be best. If an animal is too generous, others might benefit more. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could answer this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are often inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand them.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a new trend in rock music in the country for the rest of the decade. The old style of serious music with loud guitars was replaced by a lighter, more melodic style. The album mixed social themes with fun sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. It was full of humor and irony, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting different styles and writing songs. They sang about typical English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its deeper, more emotional songs like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" ""New Life"" is a beautiful album with 16 high-quality tracks and no unnecessary songs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women with great influence in ancient times. I first heard about them from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered nine books to Tarquin, King of Rome, for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three books and offered the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I learned an important lesson from this story about salesmanship and life. As a lonely child, I often asked to play with others but was refused. My mother advised me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something meaningful to me. I'm not a big traveler, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to visit. I am interested in ruins because I like to travel through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it usually goes into a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" The person sorting it is often a young editorial assistant or an experienced freelancer. They don't have much power, but they want to find something original. The junior wants to make a name for themselves, and the freelancer wants to keep their job. If they like your novel, they will pass it to a senior editor. Eventually, it will be discussed at a meeting. The editor must explain why your novel is good and if it can sell well. They also consider if you, as an author, have a future and if you can be promoted. Publishers often want to meet a new author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising Challenges in the Early 1990s**

If you worked in advertising during the early 1990s, it was likely a very tough time. The economy was in a recession, which was worse than expected. This affected many countries, especially industrialized ones, and was the worst in thirty years. In Britain, 1991 was particularly hard. The economy shrank, interest rates were high, people spent less money, over half a million people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. Every business felt the impact, with some industries like car manufacturing and construction seeing a 30% drop in business. Many people and companies suffered.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help companies make money, so they were watched closely by their bosses. They also had to do more work with less money. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies started to focus more on making products that customers wanted, not just what was easy to produce. This change meant marketing was taken more seriously, and marketing professionals gained more respect, but also more responsibility.

Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, and about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising. In the 1980s, advertising was very successful, but the start of the 1990s was difficult for the industry. The recession made companies look closely at their advertising spending. They wanted to know if the money spent on advertising was worth it. Many companies were not sure what they were getting in return for their investment in advertising.

As a result, advertising was under scrutiny. Companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement. They wanted the best people working hard to produce great advertising. This meant that advertising professionals had to find ways to do more with less money. The recession also made it hard to take risks, which are often needed for good advertising.

Other challenges included changes in population, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, more sponsorships, stricter advertising laws, and the challenge of advertising in other countries. These issues, along with the economic situation, made it important for advertising to be more effective. Companies wanted to know which parts of their advertising worked.

Finding help to improve advertising was not easy. Companies and advertising agencies were busy dealing with these challenges and did not share their successful strategies. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising were not very useful. They often made advertising seem more perfect than it was, which did not help those responsible for creating effective advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people did not want to be chefs because it is a tough job. Chefs work long hours, the job is stressful, and the pay is not good. But these things did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect way to escape from that. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. 

My wish to cook was not just because I was unhappy as a student. It was also about a love for beauty. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I still remember the starter. After eating, I wanted to thank the chef who made it. I felt happy and light for days. After this, I really wanted to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life to prepare for a career in cooking. My history degree felt empty and distracted me from my real goal. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making fancy meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming teacher was a former drill sergeant. He was small, very muscular, and had tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was very strict. Every time I came up from the water, he would say things like, ""Don't look down, look up!"" or ""Keep your legs straight."" The next week, I went up to the high diving board. It was very high, and I was scared. I tried to remember what I was taught, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I did not dive well, and my legs went everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment, but I still felt very happy. I thought, ""This is what it means to be 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For people who like a comfortable bed, running water, and safety, the idea of a traveler is hard to understand but interesting. Travelers choose to take risks. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone in small boats on big seas, and eat strange foods if they have to. They live with the unknown for months. It is easy to think of these people as strange or different, like hermits or writers. They live in a world that is not like our everyday life. We can ignore them and go back to our safe world with microwaves and phones, happy that our biggest risks are things like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is why he spends a lot of time on it. He does not say he is a top sailor, but he is good at it. He sails because he likes to write about it. Sailing gives him exciting stories to write. Raban's boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere in the world. He likes this tool, but he also thinks that old ways of sailing are important. He believes that the compass changed how people connect with the sea. Before the compass, sailors had to watch the waves and feel the sea. Now, they just follow the compass, and the sea is just a space to cross. Because of autopilots, sailors do not have to steer all the time, which gives Raban time to watch the waves closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate to experiences in books written long ago or in faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought we were alone in feeling, or express our thoughts clearly. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly written in books, even if the book was written by someone far away or long ago. We feel thankful to these writers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the boring routine of life. Our eyes are most open during our first days in a new place, or when reading a great book. Books help us notice things we ignored before. We start to see the colors of the sky, the changes in a face, a friend's insincerity, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor, but added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important details. I could have made more changes, but that would never end. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I changed the article to predict this, it would not be a true report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and trying to understand what had already happened. This is the real story of mass travel: the world opening up to people who only need a ticket. But I believe that travelers are not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that are overused, 'ecotourism' would win. The term started in the early 1980s, when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that travelers wanted to believe their trips would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, ecotourism includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour with cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, many travelers are confused about what ecotourism really means.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than I expected, staying in friendly country houses for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes only wrote short notes instead of a full story. I worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, so I added some warnings. But then I realized this book is not a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself without too many worries."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as something modern, linked to the 1800s and 1900s when capitalism grew. However, many fashion historians say that fashion, in terms of style and design, has been around for a long time. They often start with the 1500s and 1600s when markets and trade began to grow. As societies became more complex, populations grew, and new ways to make different clothes and accessories were found, the meanings of what we wear also became more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very standard, can mean different things in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Newspaper stories about publishers fighting over new books give a wrong idea of what life is like for most writers. For those of us not on the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smart ones write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs, so they have security even if their book isn't a hit. People like me, however, do various small jobs, like teaching, workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard about a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often with help from friends, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small places we were playing at around the country started to sell out, and extra security was needed to control the growing number of screaming girls. We had to use secret entrances to the places we played to avoid being surrounded by fans. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I felt a strange confidence that only shy people in similar situations might understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future Challenges**

Technology keeps changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music performances and jobs for musicians. More people can now listen to music, which is important for many reasons. Music is part of big national events and personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn instruments.

I believe people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. In Europe, group music lessons have helped with social skills and concentration in children. Playing an instrument might also help develop skills like good study habits and organization. Because of these benefits, there will be a demand for music lessons in the short term.

In the long term, music might change in two ways. First, people will listen to more types of music, mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music, making it easier for people to compose music without needing technical skills. This might mean fewer live performances. More people of all ages might want to make music in their communities, reflecting their local traditions.

To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. Music lessons and assessments will need to adapt to include more musical skills. Musicians will need to learn how to teach and inspire people of all ages, work with large groups, and have skills in communication, social interaction, and management. This is a big change from traditional music teaching. It will also require showing the public the value of music education.

Finally, we need to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is very important, but often not appreciated enough. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."

CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mostly popular with young people. However, it also had a big effect on older people and the middle class. It helped create the next group of rock stars. These young people listened to rock and roll and felt it was important to their future. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting new music was on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was very important for many young people who wanted to become rock stars. Like John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Liverpool, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to making his own.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I fell through the thin layer. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what I would do if the hole had been deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. It was clear that I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. These books often talk a lot about how to collect data but not much about how to analyze it. Many people find data analysis confusing. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about how they analyze their data. The goal was to share ideas and understanding about data analysis, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden processes more clear. Even though this sounds easy, it is not. We let our contributors share their work in different ways, like personal stories or more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show he watched recently. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't remember much. Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education is still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people didn't like it at first because they thought these new people were ruining their area of Los Angeles. But eventually, they accepted it because Hollywood became very successful. Success in Hollywood means making a lot of money at the box office. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: a film that might make someone a star but will definitely make a lot of money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a hundred years ago, you could walk through orange groves to the village store. But in some ways, it is still like a village, with a small-town feel and limited views. For people living and working there, the main topic is films: how much money they made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: they work there but live somewhere else. Still, Hollywood is the place where almost everyone in show business wants to be.

**Photography**

Photography was invented in the 19th century by artists who wanted to create a lasting and accurate record of what they saw. They found a way to do this with light, lenses, shutters, and surfaces coated with light-sensitive chemicals. These images were more lasting, realistic, and detailed than what painters could create in weeks or months. This worried other artists, and after their initial excitement, art critics said photography was not real art. They believed that because photography relied on machines, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite this, photographers knew they had discovered a new art form. They used photography to interpret the world and show their vision of nature, people, and things, just like other artists use brushes and pencils.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, when book illustrations were in black and white, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also included many novels for older readers, although this became less common as time went on. Children's publishing was very active, but it was often done on a low budget, leading to a lot of average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archives are a mix of ordinary and great work, making them a great place for research or browsing. The best works are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reprints of books or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in these works is returning, and publishers might soon see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just telling people, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also letting everyone know you are not at home. This made people realize that sharing too much online can be risky. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering dreams of wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we find out that the internet can be a dangerous place, and we can get lost in it.

This might sound sad, but don't worry. There is a way to navigate this future, thanks to a group of early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the problems of being famous, all before social media existed. These early users, known as bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. We should learn from their experiences to avoid making the same mistakes.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall shared everything, and nothing was off-limits. While some might call him an exhibitionist, his work had a certain beauty that could be seen as art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing too much online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the problem of sharing too much online remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you more, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that while the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and rich countries, people often can't sleep well and feel anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books have characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, how it works, and why they have trouble sleeping. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A sleep expert says, ""People sleep less when they are busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""

A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight hours of sleep. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting.

In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers. Volunteers are paid and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put electrodes on their heads, but they can't see dreams or thoughts. The lab is more interested in physical effects.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Volunteers come at 2 pm, when people naturally feel sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road on the screen seems endless, and the warm air makes them sleepy. Dr. Reyner has a video of someone trying not to fall asleep. At first, the driver is alert, but soon starts blinking and nodding off. The car goes off the road. Coffee can help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. She suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

We know that humans, like other animals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, we go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Scientists are sure that women sleep about 30 minutes longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.

In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poor enjoyed this quiet time the most. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours, changing sleep patterns for everyone except some country people.

Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some places, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for danger make continuous sleep impossible. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, each costing 800 dollars, while standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had on a full cowboy outfit, but I knew I wasn't a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning and felt like I might look like a cowboy from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and walked away.

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. I was addicted to driving fast cars, but I don't do it anymore. I can't even if I wanted to. I wondered what I should do now. I thought I had other plans for when I stopped racing, but they didn't work out. I tried to become a commentator for races, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work because nobody was buying them.

Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a World Champion. Even if I had been a champion, people would only listen to my story for a short time. Last year's champion is old news. I don't want sympathy because I had a good career and made money. But I miss driving those powerful cars and the excitement of racing. I miss the attention from reporters and fans. Now that I don't race, my phone hardly rings, and I have a lot of free time.

I looked at the sky and saw no buzzards, just some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I realized I had a lot to learn about life outside of racing."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people like to walk down the city streets. If you walk with them, you will probably hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has a mild climate, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe environment, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about the many new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though people don't use this name much anymore, Vancouver is still a gateway city.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we try hard to make our writing have a big impact, so we lose the natural feeling of a letter. Real artists, who don't think about the effect of their words (even if they rewrite a lot), don't have this problem. I think a real artist knows how their words will affect people. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about the big words he used, but they showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that they don't need famous people anymore. Why pay a celebrity when anyone can open it for free? Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy store didn't care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel happy and those who came later feel jealous."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941, there was a lot of excitement and controversy. Its release was delayed because the distributors were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who the film was supposedly about, might do to them. Even though the reviews were mostly very positive, the film did not make much money at first. It was television that made the film popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most inspiring film for people who want to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film was successful because he didn't know what he was or wasn't allowed to do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a film about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great energy.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head both times, but it seemed like she wasn't really listening or understanding. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I have nothing to do all day, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And like I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about making dinner."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a top recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would rather have a better job title than a pay raise. If our desire for fancy titles is stronger than our desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. Today, in the early twenty-first century, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,"I was in Vienna to take photos. Taking photos was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light looked on different surfaces and how one photo could show the true feeling of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, so I kept my camera ready. Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well that became very popular. It was just luck, but it made me famous for a short time. After that, I decided to work for myself, but things didn't go as planned. The mid-1990s were not as successful as I had hoped, even though my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which was good enough for me.

I got the Vienna job by chance. I had taken photos in London for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which also included Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the job in Vienna, so they asked me to take his place. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the other photographers. I was happy to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great to me.

They put me up at a hotel in the center of the city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in cold January, I knew it would be different. As soon as I arrived, I felt excited to take great pictures. On the first day, I just rode the trams around the city to get a feel for the place. The weather was cold and the city was beautiful. I wanted to make this Vienna my own, not like the other photographer's work. I waited for the right moments to take photos.

The next morning, I went out early. The snow had made the city look fresh and empty. I wanted to take a photo of the cathedral, but it was hard to capture it all in one shot. Its tall spire and large base made it difficult, but I knew it could still be magical. Photography has always seemed magical to me. Even when you understand how it works, it still feels mysterious. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't really surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has changed from a serious place to one full of wonder. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a unique exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves or explores movement has been an important, but often unnoticed, part of art in the 20th century. The exhibition includes paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this art for a long time, has put it together. There are not many explanations, so visitors can enjoy discovering things on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art is liked by many people, even those who usually do not care about art. People might like his work because it is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing subjects. Some people might be interested in Hockney himself because he is funny and interesting. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. They say he is popular for the wrong reasons. But others argue that he might seem less important because it is unusual for popular artists to be taken seriously. Hockney knows his limits and does not claim to be a great artist. He believes only time will tell how important his work is.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

Recently, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not. What bothers me are shows that try to push a certain idea or trend. Sometimes this works, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists to create an exhibition in an empty warehouse. We called it 'Window-shopping.' The artworks were connected only because they were all art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats played on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera art flickered on a screen. These works did not fit into a specific theme, but they worked well together. I did not try to make a big statement about contemporary art. Art is personal, and artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who love paintings sometimes do not want to analyze them because they think it will ruin their enjoyment. Some say that art historians focus too much on theory and forget the pleasure of looking at art. This is like saying that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. Enjoying art does not mean we cannot learn more about it. In fact, knowing more can make it more enjoyable. Our enjoyment of art is not just about our personal taste; it is also influenced by society. While it is important to enjoy art instinctively, thinking about it does not take away from that enjoyment. This idea comes from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have started to like metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow stone. It was not like other stones; it was special and beautiful. This is how gold might have become important to early people. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it quickly became popular. Copper might have been found by accident too. Once people saw how useful copper tools were, they worked hard to find copper and learn how to get it from rocks. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.

**St Ives**

We walked down the narrow, cobbled street carrying our bags. The wind was very strong, and we tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the path. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the sea were closed tightly. We saw the weather getting worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. The dark grey skies made us think that visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car was not a good idea. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of nice walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in good times and bad times are no longer here. The reasons they moved or stayed, and how they formed families and villages, are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with real experiments on past cultures. We cannot watch the past like a movie. But maybe we can. Computer modelling lets us create old landscapes and fill them with virtual people. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change things like rain or population to see how these virtual communities react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and saw something interesting. One day, the leader male monkey noticed a new male monkey in a nearby group of trees. This new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the leader might lose his position. To stop this, the leader monkey had a clever idea. Every time the new monkey tried to come closer, the leader gave an alarm call that meant a leopard was near. This scared the new monkey back into the trees. This trick worked well until the leader made a mistake. He gave the alarm call while he was calmly walking in the open, showing there was no real danger.

**What Cats Catch**

In the English village of Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw this and thought that all the cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is whether these numbers are too high. The answer seems to be no. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide places for birds to nest. So, the bird population stays high. The survey showed that cats are important hunters, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly and with tired sounds. They move to the reed beds far away. They stand at the edge of the platform, making tired noises, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their goal and stay there for a while. Their movements are so slow that they are hard to notice. Eventually, they swim low in the water, looking like they are struggling. They spend the day among the reeds, eating green plants they find.

**PICASSO, Pablo**

In 1940, Picasso painted things around him. In the fishing port of Royan, he painted fish still lifes. The painting shows a fishmonger's table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive, even though they are not. Picasso used a flat pattern with overlapping shapes. The colors and brushwork make the painting look calm, like an underwater scene. But there is tension, as the fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp shapes and the chain around one fish add a feeling of danger. This gives the painting a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"Photography

For the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activities. In this short time, photography has grown in its ability to show moments in time and space. It lets us see quick moments and both big and small things. Photography has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. It has become one of the most important ways to show human experiences.

However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The first pictures go back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We are not sure why early cave paintings were made. They might show real hunting events, be used for magic to increase animals for hunting, serve as religious symbols, or simply decorate living spaces. But images seem to be closely connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it promised to provide a true visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, similar to what we see. This was considered a natural phenomenon.

Photography was also seen as a cultural achievement, creating images that artists had worked hard to make by hand. Because cameras seemed so real in showing what we see, people thought everyone could understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even isolated people could understand a photo of the sky.

However, with the growth of global communication in the late 20th century, we need to ask if photos can be understood across different cultures. Is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Our familiarity with photos might make us overlook the complex ways they show reality.

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem like a simple way to communicate. This can blur the line between how we see the world and its photographic images. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and how people use it have changed a lot. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming part of history. Photos now tell us as much about the people and society that made them as they do about their subjects.

I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not just reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century brought new ways of seeing things through perspective. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Telling people how to write poetry is tricky. It's like walking through a dangerous area: you need to be spontaneous, but one mistake can ruin everything. It's risky to act like you know everything, so I won't give strict advice. Instead, if you're starting to write poetry, read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination and spirit be free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem; others write to escape sadness. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are fine, as long as you're not just copying others. It's important to find your own voice, listen to it, nurture it, and let it grow. One day, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a question quickly and keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it doesn't mean it should be too brief. A short story needs conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must be important.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players don't know much, but they know enough to play. They make moves without knowing what will happen next. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. In chess, as in writing screenplays, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin said that humans naturally speak, but writing is not natural. Language is found in all societies, and while languages change, they don't get better. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children don't have a language, they create one. Writing, however, was invented only a few times in history and only in complex societies. Most children didn't learn to read or write until recently, and many still struggle. Children naturally learn to speak, but reading and writing are skills that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it to children."
CPE_8,"I have never started writing a book with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have changed the names of the people in this story and made sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. If anyone reads my book, it will be for its own interest. But maybe the way he lived and his strong and kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was special. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book will be helpful to those who write about my friend. I don't claim that the conversations I wrote are exact. I never took notes, but I remember well what matters to me. I have written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they are true to what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't made anything up, but I have done what historians do by adding speeches I didn't hear to make the story more lively. I want people to read my book, and I think it's okay to make it interesting. Smart readers will know where I have used this trick, and they can ignore it if they want. Another reason I am worried about writing this book is that the people I write about are from another culture. It's hard to really know people from a different country. People are shaped by where they were born, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, and the books they read. You can't know these things just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only truly know them if you are one of them. Because of this, it's hard to make foreign characters believable in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen before, and if I have written about others in short stories, it's because you can describe them briefly. You give the reader a general idea and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't pretend my characters see themselves as I see them; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see the patterns and decide which writers were important. Today, poetry is especially complex. There are many different styles of poetry, ways of presenting it, and ideas about what a poet's role in society should be.

Currently, there is a debate in poetry between two groups. One group is the 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page. The other group is the 'popular' poets, who enjoy performing their poems in front of an audience. This division is not strict, and many poets do both.

Public poetry readings have become more common in the last twenty years. These events happen in many places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often expected to perform their work in public, which has mixed results for them.

For 'pop' poets, who write their poems to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses might become clear.

On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, trying to include deep thoughts and emotions in their work, may not be appreciated by an audience hearing their poems for the first time. These poets might choose to read their simpler poems to connect with the audience quickly, which might not show their best work.

Listening to poetry readings is not the same as reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm of the poems. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or already knows the poems.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make people associate poetry with enjoyment. This way, poetry does not seem like an art only for a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's not realistic to think that someone's story is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is shaped by the historian's background and how they understand history, which can affect the person being interviewed. Historians need to recognize their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the person’s memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings like nostalgia or past grievances. These emotions can make the story seem convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science: focusing on the body (physiological) and looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles create behavior. The 'whole animal' approach looks at the animal's behavior and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually study learning in animals like rats and pigeons in labs. Ethologists study natural behavior in wild animals. Although these fields are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often say their methods are more basic, but even if we understood every nerve cell, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

Students new to social sciences face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of the subject. They need to understand the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. We all know about social life from daily experiences, so social sciences might seem like common sense. But, as textbooks show, each social science looks at people in society in a unique way. Each has its own focus, methods, and concepts. These concepts are the basic ideas that help social scientists go beyond common sense and make each discipline unique.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function were not part of his main definition, though he did discuss the best designs for different purposes later in his book. The focus was on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. Before the classical style, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms contributed to later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the area, going over a small bridge with a bump, which was her only mistake. She finished her drive near the gasworks, where it smelled of sulphur. When Chen found out, he was amused and not upset. He was impressed with Lily's driving and planned a trip with her. They decided to go on a Monday, early in the morning, and return by midday to avoid losing customers. Lily practiced driving in the meantime. Mui, although unsure, bought a road map and got a discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

On the day of the trip, they left home and soon reached the English Channel. Lily drove very well, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow cars with great skill, and Chen even applauded her. They drove through a seaside town and parked in a street with empty parking spaces. Lily was unsure about the road markings, so she chose to pay for parking to avoid any trouble. She locked the van carefully, and Chen joked that no one would want to steal it. The sisters were annoyed by his comment, and Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea.

Chen thought about Man Kee's future, wanting him to have a good education and own many restaurants. The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful. He saw a ship in the distance and used a telescope to look at it. He showed Man Kee the ship and told him it was special, as it would take them back home one day. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily tried to look through the telescope, but the ship was gone by then. All she could see were seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I read somewhere that if you look from a very deep hole, you can see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle, but when I pushed the bucket off the wall, I fell into the well. I hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had kind of succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit on the head. I was first dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more worried, and I stayed quiet. I watched you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I waited a bit, then climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard Mother, Father, you, and old Arthur coming. Mother was shouting, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I saw the wet spots I left on the ground from the well to where I was hiding. I was scared they would see them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. I couldn't believe no one noticed the water trail. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I wanted revenge on you, but now things were serious. I realized I needed a plan. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after me, so no one could check it. Father looked at me like he didn't believe a word. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me sadly, like he was worried about me for lying. His look made me feel even worse than Father's words."
CPE_51,"**Moving Day**

Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it. Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. She remembered the years spent there with her children growing up.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was an adult and was helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping. She was very particular about the Steinway piano, insisting that only she could handle it properly.

Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't look like she was going to cry. Susan asked if people usually cried when moving. Fred said they often did, but they were fine once they reached the new place. It was just seeing everything taken apart that upset them.

Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. It took the removal team two hours to get it inside. Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window, and they used a crane to lift the piano into the house. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months.

Now, Susan was less mobile and found the stairs difficult. She worried about the piano getting stuck again. Fred reassured her that they were almost done, with just the piano left to move. Susan felt emotional, realizing how much the objects in the house meant to her now that they were being moved.

As the piano was carefully carried down the stairs and out the door, Susan, Robert, and Francesca started laughing with relief. They laughed so much that they cried tears of joy. As they walked down the path for the last time, Susan's only tears were from laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Book Reviews: Fun for Everyone?**

When the Internet started, one big idea was that everyone could use it. In theory, anyone could write or share anything online. But in the early days, you needed some technical skills to do this. However, one area that really opened up to everyone was book reviews. 

Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, allowed anyone to write reviews about books. People could say what they thought and give up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it let readers share their opinions, not just professional critics. Other online bookstores did the same, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the market. This meant it had the most reviews and also the most problems.

Many reviews were submitted every day, so Amazon couldn't check them all. They had a team to make sure reviews followed the rules. For example, reviews couldn't be just one word, attack the author, use bad language, spoil the ending, or talk about other reviews. But since reviewers were anonymous, some people misused the system. 

For example, some writers gave their own books great reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, wrote fake positive reviews for his book after getting bad ones. He was caught when he admitted it in an article, and the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books, but Amazon didn't always check if the comments were really from the author. 

Sometimes, readers caused problems too. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team came out, it got good reviews from the press. But people in the book felt upset and wrote angry reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days.

Despite these issues, Amazon liked that people spent time writing reviews because it was good for business. They watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were more common on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired jokes because ""ping"" is also a computer term. 

Most reviews on Amazon were serious and gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books could be boring. So, letting everyone review books was seen as a positive change."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last 200 years, people often think that artists must be different from others. We like art that is unique, new, and sometimes shocking. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But with today's art, we sometimes feel unsure and think an artist has gone too far. The media often say this, and we agree because we expect art to be confusing and new. We forget that today's art also has old themes and methods. We think artists are special and different from us, with talents that break rules. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and it was part of everyday life. Now, we let artists do what they want and get upset if they try to be like everyone else.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th

Usually, when a painter finds success in one style, they stick to it. Collectors want artists to keep doing the same thing, and trying something new can upset people. Gallery owners like safe choices, and art buyers want things to stay the same. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, change styles and succeed. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He has always liked railways and started drawing them in the 1980s. His new show, ""Underground Encounters,"" has 40 paintings and drawings of the London Underground, showing its unique charm.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would come to such a remote place to heal. I am here to heal myself. Apart from an old woman who comes to clean the house, I am alone. I am not happy or unhappy; I feel like I am floating in memories. I talked about how art seems useless but did not mention its comforts. The comfort in my work is that in the quiet of painting or writing, reality can be changed and shown in a new way. Our everyday actions hide the true meaning of life. For artists, art is a way to deal with what hurts us in life, not to avoid it, but to fulfill it with imagination. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. I had won the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. My father had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

""What isn't good?"" I asked, though I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. He usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand a lot of information quickly, you talk well, and you like performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he said, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the family business now. You'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""

Like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. But I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, nice schools, clothes, parties, theatres, and operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always lively.

""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate decisions and to avoid my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and ready.

But this was not to be. My father told me that in about a week, he needed me for one last important task for the family business. He promised it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on them. It's really important that I do well.""

I could tell my father didn't understand the pressure I felt (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him) and would see a refusal as a betrayal.

As he explained the task, I saw his dedication and skill in his work. He was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which wasn't ideal. At first, buying the house seemed like a good idea. Simon had been successful in his work, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency shortly after having twins. She even got a raise, making her salary thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who really wanted to move, and Simon didn't argue much. They needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She wanted a better address for their social and economic status. Mornington Mansions didn't fit the image of a successful young barrister and businesswoman. Lois decided they needed to save money, so one of them had to use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day at work. His grandmother made sure he had peace and comfort. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. They needed both their salaries to maintain their lifestyle. Now, their situation was at risk because of Venetia. She came to their office upset and accused Simon of knowing about a bribe in a past case. Simon denied it, but his denial didn't sound convincing, even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered being punished as a child. He wished he had been prepared for her accusations. He could have said that he didn't believe the claims about the bribe. But he lied, and Venetia knew it. Simon wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to ruin his career. If the rumor spread, his career would be over."
CPE_36,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to forget about summer, but tonight, I'm watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It's a small London garden where plants grow tall or spread out to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to like them. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she replies. Then she says, 'I'll bring something to drink.' I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'Cheers,' she adds, 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. 

I feel worried about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements with melting gum. Walking to the shops and back. The park with its fountain, and feeling lonely on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, feeling nervous. 'Of course,' Jaz says, 'if I'm around,' knowing she will be. 'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun,' I lie. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her. I imagine red vans bringing gifts to other houses and returning her rejected manuscripts. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz replies, upset. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,' Jaz says. 

Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it helps people and communities feel connected to the past. We often know about our personal heritage, like who our grandparents were and stories about their lives. But we also have a need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the past and the future. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There might be parts of our national heritage we don't like, but it is still part of us, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. But in modern society, many of these stories have been lost. Now, places and buildings help us remember the past. It is important to protect and restore these links to honor our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became very important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I thought the Fens were a quiet, empty place to set my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other place but also very unique and mysterious. It is surprising that in the middle of England, there is a place that feels foreign to many English people. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and both open and mysterious. When writing my novel, I didn't visit many places in the Fens. I haven't been to Wisbech or Prickwillow yet. As a fiction writer, I like to imagine worlds, and I prefer to guess at authenticity rather than look for proof. Imagining the Fens makes sense because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, museums should do more. Displays can be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects, not copies. They show items that were used and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what makes them different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that create exciting and accessible displays and programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by making people want to see the real things that only museums can offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly now that everyone feels it. Some people become strong preservationists, while others think more about the nature and future of towns. It can be argued that people who have lived through big events like world wars care more about preservation because stability is important to them. If there is a need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell smart products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday life. Einstein was part of a big change in science, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying how matter and forces work together. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking basic ideas like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people believed in Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, my sister Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be boring. Our mother didn't like that we thought this way, but our father would give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also give us better books as gifts, marking them with ""This Book is NOT Literature"" to make them seem more fun. Even though we thought most of these books were for boys, he did introduce us to some good short stories and once to a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that the origin of human language is a wonderful mystery. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were in danger. This sound is sad, and people who lived in dangerous places with scary animals made desperate noises. Some words today might still have echoes of these sounds, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" or the Latin ""mors"" meaning ""death"". Because of these odd ideas, many people avoided talking about the origin of language, thinking it was for crazy people. But now, the origin and evolution of language are important research areas. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not the main reason language developed, even though philosopher John Locke thought language was a big way to share knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from a writer's point of view. Most reviews are written quickly and don't last long. They have deadlines and strict limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only relevant for as long as the newspaper or magazine is current, which is usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, reviews are often seen as not very important. Many people, including the writers, think that reviewing is something you do only if you need extra money or if you can't spend all your time on writing a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled job. It's one thing to be clear and fair in a short newspaper review, and another to write a long, detailed review for an international journal. Writing a medium-length review for a weekly magazine has its own challenges. Reviewers also need to think about who will read their reviews, from casual readers to those very interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. This means that reviewers often write other things besides reviews. For example, the American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews when he is not working on his novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books. Some people might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews won't last, but if they can, they should be allowed to keep their work. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors write as part of their jobs. In the English-speaking world, it's common for the same people to write both reviews and academic books. In the past, other academics criticized professors who wrote reviews, but now it's more accepted. There is more reviewing work available now, so almost everyone can do some. I think this is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It's also good for professors because it helps them stay connected to the real world and reminds them to write clearly for people who are not professors. In the end, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment and felt a small worry about owning it, even after three years. When he first bought the apartment, he would come home excited, wondering what the place had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming space where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or leaks, but the apartment always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would have messages when he got back. He was glad the windows weren't broken and nothing was stolen, but he wondered what it would look like if it happened. From his boring office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to spending three or four evenings alone at home each week. Once he left the busy office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone. At his desk, he wanted time alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt lonely and thought that doing a job he didn't like had changed him, taking him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. His thoughts and feelings were unclear, and he couldn't find a connection. He remembered a time when he felt more in control and thought he could have done something different if he had known his own worth. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future but only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs his friends talked about and followed their paths, not thinking he could find a job that made him happy. He went to one job interview and didn't think much about the job itself. It was an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was happy to have a nice conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would have later. Neil offered him the job right away, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I moved through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse, and I pushed through the crowds to find a good spot. A part of the area was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch the goats run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since the morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the torch batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley said she saw a light, and we felt hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop, and we kept moving.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and big shareholders. How can I get better at presenting and feel more confident? 

You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues to think of the difficult questions your audience might ask. Also, create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone agrees on and slowly move to your main point."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They need their own time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush when making mayonnaise and add the oil too fast, it will spoil. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things it does very quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But some things cannot be rushed, or they will not work well, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

Sometimes, thinking fast is not helpful, like trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one saying. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three different speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, when my motorbike slipped on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also reacts quickly without thinking. This fast reaction is called our ""wits.""

Then there is thinking itself, which involves figuring things out, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist studying an experiment, or a student working on homework all use this kind of thinking. We call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever.""

There is also a slower way of thinking. It is less clear and more relaxed. When we are daydreaming or just waking up, we use this slower thinking. It is as intelligent as the faster ways. Letting the mind wander is important, especially when life is busy. Thinking slowly is important for solving some problems. Some situations are better understood with a relaxed mind. Recent studies show that slower thinking helps with complex or unclear situations. Fast thinking works well when the problem is clear. But when we do not know what to consider, we need slow thinking.

For example, deciding how to handle a difficult group at work or whether to change careers might be better with slow thinking. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have always known the limits of fast thinking and have used slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have started studying these slower ways of knowing. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than fast thinking."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It's a friendly and well-supplied base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a big problem for me, but at first, it affected my confidence. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure about which table to choose, scared of the silence when I spoke, and anxious like I was in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for my occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication, but because I have lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him again, he shook hands with me politely, but didn't try to become friends. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, he sent me a note asking me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, because my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn't care much about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with guesses, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and he didn't explore his own screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books about practical astronomy. Today, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can stay in the sky for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. People always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that give meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. We do not let anything change this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which some people think is being equal. I also do not like waiters who try to be too friendly. I know most of the guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Respect for privacy is rare in hotels these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

A special performance of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a review I wrote when the show first started last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and criticized his acting. I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important, but I now admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is excellent. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Some memorable scenes include Cassio's dangerous games with other young officers and the moment when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional and might make you cry. The play is exciting and full of tension. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the middle of Antarctica, there is no movement. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except for a huge hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water in the lake has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that some scientists are very passionate about why they become scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the old search for knowledge and the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. It seems more important to know if what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too much sugar and preservatives, you can make a tasty dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is important to us, which is why we celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other events with meals. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not yet organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could pretend to be surprised. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. He smiled at her hopefully, but she looked at him with a hard expression. She seemed to think, ""No way am I going in there,"" as she went into his apartment, which was her responsibility. Mrs. Wilson thought of him as someone from far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story of strength. A key moment in her life was when she was twelve, and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor said the bone protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's exciting to be the first to know something important, and her life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, helping her with her yearly throat problems. She appreciated how he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her busy schedule, she has started writing books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna is known for her amazing piano performances, playing many different styles like classical, jazz, and blues. At a recent concert for children, a young boy asked her to play the theme from ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found this funny and played it, showing that she passed the boy's test of being a ""proper pianist.""

Joanna is different from many top pianists because she cares about how young children learn the piano. She has written a piano book for beginners called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" Even though she is very busy with concerts and running her own recording label, she believes the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks music should be for everyone, not just for those who are very talented.

Joanna's interest in teaching comes from her own experiences. Before she became a famous pianist, she taught beginners. Her mother also taught piano, and Joanna grew up with many children learning different types of music at her home. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.

Some children learn piano quickly, but Joanna is interested in those who take their time. She worries that some parents push their children too hard to succeed in music, which can make children lose interest. Joanna wants music to be something children enjoy, not something they feel pressured to do.

Joanna's books are colorful and fun, with stories and CDs to help children learn. She believes learning piano should be enjoyable. She encourages children to improvise and explore the piano. As children progress, they need to learn to read music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes practice is the most important part of learning piano.

Joanna practices for eight hours a day and finds it very important. She advises children to plan their practice, play through pieces even with mistakes, and mix difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is often not enjoyable to read. This means that good writing is usually difficult to create. When I look at my old school essays, I notice there are not many mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard work. Writing slowly by hand helps the brain think carefully. When it is hard to change or erase something, we write more carefully. But with computers, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing their computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Also, emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. Some people say emails have brought back the art of love letters, and many are sent every day. But words on a screen can feel boring. People who write on computers often exaggerate, and their words can lose meaning. Writing quickly on a computer lacks the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back. I agreed and gave the disc to him carefully. ""It's incredible they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He put the disc in and closed it. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. ""No,"" Mr. Warriston said. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused, then thoughtful. ""I don't know. You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand,"" he said, smiling. ""Good point."" He pointed to my chair. ""Let's get you in the best spot for the stereo sound,"" he said. I was happy to ask a question he couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were invented after lighters, we would think they were a great improvement. Many people say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing. They forget that big changes take a long time. In 1979, a book said that books would slowly disappear in the 1980s. But that was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so most people don't do it. Computers make it easy to read small parts of text. Some people say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but reading parts of a book is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. What is new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office, which was perfectly organized. The carpet was clear, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered. Files were neatly put away, and trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then spoke to him. ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room. He didn't think about adding a computer or any other machine. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had talked about this many times. Kathleen couldn't understand why he didn't want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. She could use a keyboard to change any software into something new."
CPE_32,"Lancelot's secretary shouted, ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" She wasn't really asking because she had been making him coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there often. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that if he stayed away, things would go wrong. He thought about how he went from being an important advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to someone always trying to prevent problems, even struggling to find a parking spot at work.

His secretary handed him a folder and said, ""This came from that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It was an ""Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis; he wanted a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a lot of money in advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but he was unpredictable and hard to work with.

Lancelot read the synopsis, which was almost the same as before. He closed the folder, thinking Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and seemed to have lost its energy. Lancelot remembered a famous author who had to be paid for each chapter to finish his book. But Ian had already received a large advance, which was not a good business practice.

Lancelot had studied modern languages at Oxford and remembered when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends had taken over British theatre quickly, but Ian, despite his talent, never fulfilled his potential. He was difficult to work with, even when he was supposed to edit a big arts magazine. The magazine never came out, even though it used up the budget for many issues. Ian's contract with a fashion magazine also produced little, despite increasing his pay to encourage him to work.

At meetings, Ian was known for his sharp comments and criticism of others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to think that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"Text: 'The breakfast change in England

Health experts say that having a good breakfast is very important. But in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, breakfast is not often mentioned in books. Sometimes, there are stories about travelers eating early before long trips or sick people eating breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became normal for everyone. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. But they might not think about other big social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working for set hours, often very early in the morning. So, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was not just for the rich anymore."
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal opinions, and experiences, along with social and cultural rules. In this book, we will see how these things affect the style, content, and feeling of a photo, and how people see and react to these images. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they might think they understand the photos they see. But instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it really shows the scene as it was. Or does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the exact moment in the photo important, or should we see the photo as a symbol of something happening in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful people in sport believe in themselves completely. You need to focus only on your goal if you want to succeed. There is only one way to be the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. You either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me self-discipline and determination, but it also shows you how to work well in a team. My sport lets you shine as an individual, but it is also a team game, and you have to balance these two parts. It's like life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember there are others around you. Sport has given me a lot - not just money. It has opened many opportunities for me and shown me things around the world that others may never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences stay very clear in our memory. For me, one such moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To understand the bird's music, I thought about my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an amazing, improvised performance. I reacted with surprise and joy as each new musical variation came through the open window where I lay listening, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Birds have always been important in human culture. We love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. Some people see wrens as mysterious birds that bring messages or signs. Is this wren trying to tell me something, or is it just stuck? Maybe both are true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed the direction a wren flew could bring good or bad luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens are still loved. A forest without wrens feels empty.

This connection to birds comes from old stories and beliefs. In the past, people depended on nature to survive, so they created stories to explain the world around them. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London, seen as helpful because it cleaned the streets. Later, people saw it as a pest, and it disappeared from most places except Wales. Now, red kites are protected and are a symbol of conservation in Britain.

Our connection to birds is deep and goes back to early humans. Early humans watched birds to learn about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and wish for. Some people think these feelings are old and not needed now, but they are still part of us.

Today, birds show us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have special meanings in stories and poems. Losing them is a big cultural loss. 

Folklore, or traditional stories and beliefs, is important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that scientific facts cannot. They help us feel and understand our connection to nature. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain with science. Birds are fascinating, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their messages. The wren in the greenhouse is like a puzzle, connecting the present with the past and future, and it keeps me wondering."
CPE_28,"Maps are used to show how different places and features on Earth relate to each other. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel than the actual distance. Direction was not very important for travelers who just wanted to know where to go and how far it was. Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions.

Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs could be different sizes to show how important they were. The way maps were made depended on their purpose and where they were made. To understand old maps, it is important to know the map-making style used at that time.

The history of map-making, or cartography, is about making maps more accurate in showing distance and direction and adding more details. Over time, map-makers used other sciences to help them. For example, they used the magnetic compass to find direction more accurately. They also used tools to measure angles precisely. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it better. Scientists found out that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, which changed how large areas were mapped.

The need for maps changed over time. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for planning battles, especially with the use of artillery. This led to the invention of contour lines to show land features. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also needed maps for their work. Modern map-makers now create maps showing different things like rock layers, weather patterns, and land use.

Today, maps are important for understanding and organizing information in many sciences. This has led to a new interest in making better maps. However, the progress in map-making has not always been steady. Sometimes, old ideas stayed around even when new ones were available. Map-makers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since it was easy to copy old maps, some map publishers were slow to accept new ideas. Therefore, maps should not always be seen as perfect evidence of what people knew at the time.

The many maps we have today show a lot of human effort and thought. They are valuable for learning about the past. This makes studying old maps both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"I was invited into a young man's living room, which was very nice compared to the messy rooms around it where his family stayed. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and he had even bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as crazy; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me, though I can say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was willing to try. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very good. As he played more music from shows he had written at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but on the bus back to my flat, I thought I had just met someone with rare talent and determination. I would be crazy not to work with him, as he was going to be a big name in musical theater soon. Even if we didn't succeed in musical theater, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and might need new songs. The next day, back at my desk where I was training to be a lawyer, my excitement about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would keep looking for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs that suited my voice. But it was likely I would pass my exams and become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me because if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and write lyrics like musical writers instead of pop stars. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was clear, and he said he had all the contacts. I soon went back to his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started orphanages. His story was good, but it didn't excite me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the idea was not very original, similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was catchy and not completely wrong. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar, there's room for two. We could be the second one. I started working with a lot of enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played the tunes, and often gave me the title, most of which were probably thought up by his previous lyricist friend. I skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theater lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other very precisely using language. Language is so important to us that it's hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when people are alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk naturally, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders didn't learn web-making from a smart spider or need special training; it's just something they do naturally.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can change how landscapes look. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow, which have many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together make up the climate, happen because large amounts of air move and mix. The air is always moving because the earth spins, and the air doesn't move as fast as the earth. The sun is another important reason for air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, especially how to clean and take care of the espresso machine. I also learned how to make a perfect cup of cappuccino, which is rich and frothy. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee is not easy, and I thought I might have to go back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These should be easy for TV because cameras can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that show both the joy and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored in British galleries. I thought the series would focus on great artworks, but it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is less controlled than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a big part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the price of rare metals stable have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being mined, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its nearby small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something special. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**

At the Bamboo Bike Club in Hackney Wick, east London, you can join a weekend course to build your own bamboo bike. This club is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. They offer a fun experience where you can create a custom bike frame designed on a computer.

Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have brought back this old method of making bikes. However, buying a ready-made bamboo bike frame can be very expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868.

James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for everyone. They spent years working on their idea in a shed in Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell bike frames; they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. So, they started the Bamboo Bike Club, which they run alongside their full-time jobs. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.

The course is affordable and includes a custom bike frame and a weekend of building. On the first day, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You start by putting together the front triangle of the bike with bamboo tubes. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks.

Building the bike is a challenge, but James and Ian are there to help. They make sure everything is done correctly and will assist if you have trouble. Many people who join the course are engineers, but anyone can do it. If you make a mistake, you can try again with a new piece of bamboo.

On Sunday, you focus on wrapping the joints with hemp and glue to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. The finished bike is strong and can last a long time. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested one off-road for three months without breaking it.

Bamboo bikes might look a bit rough compared to professional ones, but they are unique. They are great for a relaxed ride, not for racing. The bike is light and smooth to ride because bamboo reduces vibrations. The cost of building your own bamboo bike is less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on how men and women can communicate better is very popular in the self-help industry. This industry is growing fast and claims to help Americans improve their lives. It also benefits from people's desires to get better and supports the publishing world in New York. In Britain, people are learning that this type of book can fill shelves with titles that seem exaggerated, but there are worse books. Many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are looking for the next big hit, and they care more about how well the book can sell than about the writing style. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions and admits, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's most of the work done. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There needs to be an understanding between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. This agreement is often not fully kept. Writers might leave out things they find too embarrassing or unimportant. Sometimes, they might think that making up stories can show the truth about themselves better than sticking to the facts. Or they might decide from the start not to tell the truth. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This can be done without being cynical. 

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories became popular because they reflect the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These stories are like allegories. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it shows how society can work smoothly again. In Hammett's stories, society goes back to normal, but it is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The detective is both a crook and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his connection to the criminal, and sometimes he is more eager to punish because of this connection.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is a great scientific essayist. To talk about writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying to promote his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said, ""I couldn't write about a place like this. Trollope might, but he knew the culture. Knowing the culture is important for a writer. Science is like its own civilization. Only scientists can present it well. If you don't understand the community, you can't write about it properly."" Gould believes you should never talk down to the reader. ""You can simplify the language but not the argument. If readers feel patronized, your piece is ruined."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym in the City of London, the air feels very cold. This gym is popular with people who work nearby. Because of the very hot summer, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. This is an example of how people often use too much air-conditioning. Air-conditioning is now a big part of our lives, showing how we can change the climate around us. But many buildings could stay cool in other ways. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can really help and would mean we need less air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches got better, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are interested in them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts working. Sundials are calm and romantic, reminding us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I used to think china-painting was only for very skilled people. I once saw older women at an arts show painting teacups with perfect flowers. They were so good that it seemed like they had been doing it for many years or were born with a special talent. I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners be naturally good at it? But when I visited a class, it was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I remembered."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price. It included a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent told them that the other people in their group were students learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe there was a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they arrived, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was part of the plan. It was almost midnight when they reached the hotel, and they were too tired to ask questions. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken.

Keith calmly told the receptionist there was a mistake because they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, came over. Dawne explained they were in the wrong hotel. Mrs. Franks said there are many holidays with similar tickets and labels, and sometimes people follow the wrong group.

Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she would check and left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened.

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, talked to them. They said they had a great night's sleep because of the lakeside air. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape from the demands of the elderly. Uncle had even said that was the point of the holiday."
CPE_48,"**He Was a People Person**

American business leaders are looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a great example of good leadership. Eluned Price reports.

In Britain, many people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, in America, he is only now becoming well-known. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about Shackleton and his famous ship, the Endurance, are being written and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a movie about his life.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and learn lessons about leadership and communication from his story. They even use the term ""speaking Shackleton"" to describe using his methods. Shackleton, with his clever use of resources like a reindeer sleeping bag and a blubber-stove, is now seen as a model for modern management.

Jim MacGregor, a manager at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has been inspired by Shackleton for years. His company deals with communication during business mergers, acquisitions, and crises. For example, if a company's factory explodes or if many employees need to be let go. MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great example of leadership because he was a strong leader and communicator. He made tough decisions, like turning back from the South Pole in 1908 when he was only 97 miles away, to save his men's lives.

In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. Today, managers often avoid responsibility, but Shackleton was different. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Shackleton told his men they would survive if they trusted him and did their best. He always stayed in control and kept his men informed.

Shackleton believed an explorer needed optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor says that in difficult situations, sometimes doing nothing is the hardest thing, especially in America, where people want quick solutions. If you make a wrong decision, like buying bonds at the wrong time, you should wait instead of selling at a loss. Also, don't be afraid to change plans if they aren't working.

Shackleton led by example. On the journey back from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if Hurley didn't wear them. Someone else remembered Shackleton giving away a biscuit when they were starving, saying he would leave it in the snow if they didn't take it.

Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says that people today are looking for real heroes. Shackleton shows us that true heroism is rare now. He stands out as a genuine example of the ideals we miss today."
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insect larvae inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects.

Scientists have known about the aye-aye's feeding habits for over a hundred years, but they recently discovered how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her baby Annabelle. He wanted to see if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood, like holes where insects might have entered. He gave them logs with drilled holes, some with mealworms inside and some empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, without needing to see any signs on the surface.

Dr. Erickson tested if the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects, but they didn't. They could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent. So, how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes could sense empty spaces inside the wood. They tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their big ears. Dr. Erickson thinks they use echo-location, like bats, to hear the sound of the taps and find hollow spaces. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar is interesting, but there are also birds there that look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is unique because it is like a woodpecker, an echo-locating bat, and even a squirrel. Its teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild breaking open nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat."
CAE_19,"Title: Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we really know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories often don't give us the full picture. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they still don't tell the whole story.

Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. These are books of at least 20,000 words, sometimes with pictures, about ordinary people, not celebrities. She got the idea when she realized that much of her family's past was being forgotten. ""At first, I didn't take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people with interesting lives who wanted to share their stories. They do it for their children or future generations, but they also enjoy the process.""

Hannah's clients feel safe to be honest because she keeps their stories private. One man, 62 years old, shared his life story, including painful parts like his divorce. He did it for his family, hoping they might learn something. However, he hasn't let his children read it yet because some details might hurt them. He thinks they should read it after he is gone.

Hannah has noticed that many people repeat patterns from their childhood. They often marry people their parents would like or do the opposite to rebel. Many still feel disappointed about things that happened with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who was never impressed, and some want to say, ""I can't stand my mother.""

Hannah listens to people's stories without judging. She lets them decide what to include in their book. People usually want to be honest, even about the bad parts. It's not about showing off an interesting life; it's about keeping a connection to the past. We are losing touch with our history, and these books help us remember.

Each book takes about 30 hours of recorded interviews. Hannah uses these to write the life story, organizing and interpreting the events. Modern technology helps her create the book, except for the cover with gold lettering. The book is meant for a private audience and is not a cheap product. It costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. Hannah gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the price stops many people. She thought it would be more affordable, but her clients are often wealthy people who might have had their portraits painted in the past."
CAE_24,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of Greek and Roman sculpture copies in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, nothing here is real. All the sculptures are exact copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. The good thing about plaster casts is that sculptures originally shown together but now in different museums across Europe can be seen together again. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

**B. Cambridge Darkroom**

Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography with community darkrooms and a gallery showing different photography exhibitions. We often have courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a Beginner's Course, a short Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that lets members use our darkrooms. We also help young photographers (aged 12 to 16) improve their skills with our Young Members program, led by our resident photographer. We sell photography books, magazines, and materials.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**

The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all over the world and from all geological ages. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, made by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting items kept in their original early 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, added a lot to the collections, making the museum truly special. The collection is organized by geological age, so you can see the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery shows the beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern use.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**

There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos all over Great Britain. The photos are interesting as they show the landscape and human activity from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. The photos cannot be borrowed, but you can buy copies, which usually take about a month to make.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running centre of its kind in the world. It is a unique tourist attraction where you can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The centre makes resin copies, called facsimiles, to protect the originals while allowing people to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates were used as memorials instead of statues and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed during revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the Cambridge Centre has a wide range of examples."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**

I have had 35 years of being around small children because of my unusual personal life. I have loved every moment of it. This morning, I fed the baby, and for me, that is what being a father is all about. I am very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I am more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in hitting children. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am here if they need me, but I let them call me. If you start asking them why they haven't called, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and clothes. This has been very helpful for my work at the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy building my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies with us without feeling shy. I think it helps that I have a job they find glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more involved in politics, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if there are facilities for my kids to come with me. This way, they know what I do when I am not with them, and they don't feel like I am disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the importance of involving our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about being a father. I tried hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even lived next door to each other for a while, so the kids could come and go as they wanted, but I think they found it confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too liberal. I think I could have been more organized. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a nice house. We thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just another parent. It's a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her makes it go away. A baby's smile is the best way to make a grown man melt."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joined students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, the aircraft looked normal. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, similar to a Boeing 707 passenger plane. But inside, it was different. The plane had a long white tunnel with almost no windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except a few at the back where the nervous students sat. 

For a year, these 13 students from Europe and America competed to be on this flight. The European Space Agency challenged them to suggest creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, which was like an extreme roller-coaster ride. 

For two hours, the plane flew like a giant bird, going up and then diving down. At the top of each curve, the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters. The plane continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. During the few seconds between going up and falling, everything inside became weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The plane took off smoothly, but soon the pilot made it climb at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and we were thrown across the cabin floor. Then the engines stopped, and we were weightless almost immediately. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence. The floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We floated without direction; up, down, left, or right no longer made sense.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned suddenly, and some students landed with a bump. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They used a device to turn it belly-down with radio controls. 

Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by no gravity, thinking about future space stations. Another team from Utah State University tried to create solar sails from thin liquid films using ultraviolet light. They hoped these sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of flying between the sky and Earth, breakfast felt uneasy, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Made My Connection to New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology.""

I had a strange time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from my home, which is winter in New Zealand. So, I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was okay for planting trees.

I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs. So, the idea of planting trees sounded nice, and I was excited. The rest of my family became enthusiastic as we continued. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it rained a lot during the winter. It was a very happy time, even though it rained almost every day we were planting. I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning, I had to prepare for planting again. I would get out of the Land Rover, feeling warm and dry, but the rain would start, and my clothes were still wet from the day before. My boots were soaked, and my hands struggled with slippery laces. During this time, I had many thoughts and ideas about life.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful because I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag around your neck, filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it becomes lighter. The hardest part was making sure the lines were straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then line up three poles to guide you. Once in line, you plant all the way down, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs. You train your body to do the same moves, and it becomes easy. You take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, plant it, stamp it in, and move on.

Mentally, it was interesting. My thoughts about the natural world and our place in it started during this time. I've returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, like strong winds or droughts. But the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.

In 1984, I took a break from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" there. I stayed in a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees, and in the evenings, I did research. The connection between me and that area is still very strong. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" I thought when one of my helpers handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, and we are known for taking care of orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange, like a mix between a laugh and a bark. Curious, I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky-colored eyes on their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and live underground. If they lose their mother, they usually die of hunger and are never found. These three were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. The mother was dead, and the babies were still trying to feed from her. They were healthy but cold and crying. After removing their fleas, I took them into the warm kitchen and placed them by the stove. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to mimic their mother licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. They seemed happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was not as active, though he was eating normally. It was a warning sign. I didn't act quickly enough, and the next morning, I found him dead. The vet said Willow died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can go into the lungs. This caused an infection in Willow that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. I was sad about losing Willow but continued caring for the others. Then, a local farmer brought me another male cub, also abandoned. He was cold and hungry, so we named him Willow II. He was about two weeks younger than the females and very hard to feed. I had to move the bottle's teat around in his mouth to get him to drink. After a while, he would finally latch on. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and other foods, but Willow II struggled. He would walk through his food or sit in it. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods. At nearly five months old, they all ate cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were lucky because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.

By August, the cubs became more active at night and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their games. I learned to avoid their playful bites, but Derek, who joined us less often, did not. His reactions to being bitten were sometimes as colorful as his bruises. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food, as badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive to outsiders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we made the gate more secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help. We started a project to build a home for the badgers on the farm. With advice and help, we designed a new home for them. Our son Daniel made the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for people to see inside. As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they stopped going for walks and enjoyed their new home. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Later, I checked on them and saw three badgers sleeping soundly in their chambers. Now, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before heading off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"Text: 'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass changes. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was mapping 'compass variations' during his sea trips on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't correct their compasses, making it hard to find their exact position at sea. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip ended early due to crew problems, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, past South Georgia, up to Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate. Dr. Clark, who also loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during a two-year stay at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' Dr. Clark says. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He wasn't just an astronomer; he also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and found time for other interests.' During this time, Halley developed a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his book Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more accurate tools. These measurements need updating because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the current model of Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It's common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements around the world. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and he notes that ground-based measurements are useful for comparison. It's easy to forget how important Halley's Atlantic journey was. It was the first scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian made a naval captain to study declination. Does Dr. Clark have what it takes to make his journey a success? Besides spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with four different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I'm ready to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display puzzled Charles Darwin because, in a world where survival is tough, it seemed strange that birds would have such extravagant tails. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the strongest and smartest survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection.' He thought females chose mates based on beauty.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a good reason. Maybe these males had other qualities that helped them survive, even if humans couldn't see them.

Today, scientists like Marion Petrie from the Open University are studying peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails and if these males have other advantages. Observations show that peahens do like males with more eye-spots on their tails, which means longer tails. But it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and have fewer parasites. This could be true for other birds, but it hasn't been tested in Whipsnade peacocks yet. This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the attractive ones have healthier or faster-growing children.

There's another idea from R.A. Fisher, a mathematician and biologist. He proposed 'Fisher's Runaway,' which suggests that if females prefer males with slightly better tails, their children will inherit these traits. Over time, this preference could lead to males with very long tails, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with new technology. Most of these boats are based on designs from 25 years ago. My boat, however, is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some might think I am a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses old boat design magic, but modern technology made it easier to build. 

Modern technology is important in boat design and building, but it often makes sailing too easy. Many people go to sea to experience the challenges of sailing. I don't think sailors should suffer, but I like my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. If everything on a boat is automatic, like the sails, it takes away from the experience. Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of being a sailor. 

Some boats have steering positions in the middle, which makes the cabin bigger, like a hotel room. But I believe a boat should feel like a boat, not a house. When I bought my old boat, Hirta, I sailed around Britain for a TV race. The previous owner said it had comfort but no luxury. Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics. Yet, she was the nicest boat I ever sailed. 

Old boats need a lot of care. After I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a new boat I liked, so I decided to build one. The Westerman has been great. Nigel Irens, the designer, first drew the boat on a napkin, then used a computer. He also made a model, like in the old days. We made changes until the design was perfect. 

The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails smoothly, and feels peaceful inside. This is because she was designed as a sailing boat first, not for furniture. She shows that you don't need to follow trends to be happy. Built with treated wood, she is waterproof like a fiberglass boat but looks and feels like a traditional one."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was happy to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like body conditioning, stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The one-hour facial made me feel like a new person. The staff were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning to add a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room this year. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling great and full of energy. I definitely want to visit again. This is a perfect break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this grand home was clear from the moment I walked up the large staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and lots of space, so you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. When you arrive, you get a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. But I was impressed when a shoulder problem found during the check-up was quickly shared with the fitness instructor. We worked on it in group workshops and an extra individual session. Each person gets a specific diet to follow. I lost weight without fasting, but I was hungry enough to get a headache on the second day. My typical daily menu was grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for supper. If you're not fasting, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and nicely presented. You have a massage or water therapy every other day. Extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a big lounge. If you're watching your calories, you might skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool to help burn off the extra calories. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around. - Beverly D'Silva

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a famous restaurant, has dishes that are amazing. The dinner menu has many choices. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments if you want them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's. - Kay Letch

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's delicious, but the worst because it's 360 calories, which is not good if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best night's sleep in years. The place is modern, well-run, with up-to-date facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments. They offer many treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments.

In the last seven million years, since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much. Genetically, we are still more than 98% the same as chimps. On a big evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is a recent change. Our ability to make art and do other things we think are uniquely human must come from a small part of our genes. This is a lot to expect from just a few genes. 

It's not surprising that studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are not. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have a simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a special genetic gift, it's strange that our ancestors didn't make art for most of the 7 million years since they split from chimps. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't know because these materials don't last. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments, only appears around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from similar animal works? Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it's made for beauty, and it's learned, not inherited.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means human art doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike most animal behaviors. Human art can communicate thoughts or feelings, but that's not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps defend territory or attract mates, which helps pass on genes. By this measure, human art is different.

The second claim is that only human art is made for beauty. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, so they probably don't sing just for beauty. Again, human art seems unique.

The third difference is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, are born knowing their species' song. A French baby raised in Japan wouldn't suddenly sing the French national anthem. Human art changes quickly, unlike animal behaviors. 

For example, geese honked 2,000 years ago and still do today, but human art changes so fast that even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in a 1957 exhibition in London, and most were sold, which many human artists can't claim.

These paintings by chimps blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, the ape paintings weren't made for practical reasons but for the painter's satisfaction. You might say human art is different because it's meant to communicate, but even some famous human art was made for the artist's personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"Title: A Big Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story. 

There are not many big adventures left, and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories often had brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. Today, you don't find such people in stories or real life. At least, that's what I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's big adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. The name of the desert means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were actually long-distance truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous and could have ruined the expedition.

This group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's toughest desert. Charles Blackmore wrote an amazing story about their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to prove something to himself. 'I always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to find out who Charles Blackmore really was, outside of the Army. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading his story will wonder why he used the word 'kind'. The team faced many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and losing part of their water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's famous sandstorms. And we never faced the freezing desert cold that could have stopped us completely. That's not to say we weren't facing challenges all the time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were very hard to climb, for us and the camels, which often fell over onto us.'

'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn't allow for one. No aircraft flew over us. Once we were in the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" At that moment, I was very scared.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've gone through so much; you've come so far. We were very thin, but very strong despite being exhausted. My body was in good shape, and my legs were like machines. I could walk over anything.'

In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert looking up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How aware was he of the difficulty it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I doubt myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to do it. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than anything else I've done. But in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- compared to that, the desert doesn't measure up.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I long for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the purpose of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it hard now to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Susan Harr felt overwhelmed by technology, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and save time. However, Susan realized that technology can be expensive and not always worth the trouble. She started to let go of household gadgets as they stopped working. This made her question if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets.

When her word processor broke, she left it in the backyard. She found freedom in not being tied to noisy machines and enjoyed taking her time with tasks like sewing. She discovered that some gadgets, like the washing machine, are very useful, but others, like the TV, can be replaced with simpler versions. Without a color TV, her family spent more time walking the dog, reading, and talking.

Susan also started sewing by hand after her sewing machine broke. She found it relaxing and satisfying to see her work improve. She realized that doing things by hand slowed down her life and freed her from the rush of modern life. She even enjoyed washing dishes by hand, which gave her time to daydream.

Now, Susan looks around her house and wonders if she really needs things like the freezer, microwave, or electric lights. She thinks they could save a lot of money by living with fewer gadgets."
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt visits him at his workshop in East London. When she arrives, Hurst seems to be in a hurry. He quickly shakes her hand and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It's not clear if he is naturally brusque or just shy. His workshop is busy, filled with half-made furniture and colorful wood. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a great reputation. He is always busy with orders, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen unit, Hurst is the person to go to.

Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one like Hurst, who makes simple and beautiful furniture, is rare. Hurst is disappointed by some modern furniture and doesn't like mass-produced, low-quality pieces. He believes his success comes from his quest for perfection and his talent. Hurst is confident in his skills and says, ""I have a huge natural ability."" He learned his craft by asking the right questions and teaching himself.

Most of Hurst's work comes from private clients. Some clients come back to him many times, which he finds satisfying. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients don't know what they want until it's too late. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want.

Hurst is also willing to praise others who are better than him. He admires other craftsmen but criticizes those who take too long to make one piece or try to make fashion statements with their furniture. He believes furniture should be practical and not just for show.

Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As Joanna leaves, he humbly says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three ideas about why we sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This means sleep must be very important. But scientists still do not agree on exactly why we need to sleep so much. There are three main ideas. The first and most popular idea is that sleep is mainly for our body's health. It says we sleep to keep our body healthy. While we sleep, our body fixes any damage from the day and makes us ready for the next day. The second idea focuses on learning. It says sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, we would not be able to learn well. The third idea is about energy. It says we need sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**Eccentrics**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is different from what is normal. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own little habits or interests. For example, some people love entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is about being unique. Inside us, there is a struggle between wanting to be different and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains pushing against each other on the same track. One train is called individualism, and the other is conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong. This is stronger than wanting to be different and stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find others like them. They form clubs, have meetings, and organize events to share their interests. They look for people who understand them, even if others think they are odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, feels comforting. We all feel a pull between being ourselves and fitting in. We might say we are different, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new person says, ""You must take me as I am.""

At any time, we can choose to be more individual. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, an American singer, said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and keep going, you will surprise many people."" But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. If a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a hostess says shocking things to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. However, if they keep doing these things until it becomes who they are, then they might be eccentric. True eccentricity is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care about what others think. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of the world and react to it. Some want to impress society, and some want to escape it, but they are aware of it. Eccentrics, however, continue on their own path without worrying about society."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four nature experts to share the wildlife book that influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've met many important people in this field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small but strong woman. She was very important in environmental issues in Europe after World War II. She combined her experiences into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field better. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think ""The Home of Man"" is her most important book. It talks about the fast growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It's a passionate call for what we now call 'sustainable development.' I've read many books since, but none match it.

**B. Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a herring gull colony. This book explains animal communication very well with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony makes sense. You can see which birds are partners and where their territories are. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with Eric Ennion, a talented wildlife artist, to create this book. Ennion's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the work of a true nature expert.

**C. Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book made me love the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was having a tough time, but reading this book made me happy. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty all together. Many people say humans are bad because of what we've done to nature. But I like to think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family. We need to understand this idea.

**D. Bruce Pearson**

I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. I was attracted to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and liked identifying birds. This book encouraged me to start sketching birds. It had more than just beautiful paintings. There were chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as important as a scientific one. Since I was better at art than math or physics, it opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five top British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in a newspaper. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than for other reasons like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually calmer about bad reviews. They think that any mention, good or bad, can help sell books because people want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own thoughts about a book because they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are still often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make a book and its author known. A good review by a trusted person can increase sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for literary publishing. Without them, we would struggle. We publish books by authors who are not famous, so we rely on reviews because we don't advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Reviews can help sell books, but they need to work with other things like word-of-mouth, support from bookshops, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
In Britain, the link between publishing and reviews is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, bookshops don't always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for people to start reading a writer's work. Some poorly reviewed books sell very well, so it's unpredictable. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on what the reviewer knows about the topic than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell well because people felt they didn't need to buy the book after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's more about the surprise of who reviews it or how interesting the review is that makes people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,"Text: 'WEATHERVANE MAKER Making weathervanes is a very old skill, starting in early Egyptian times. Today, this craft is still alive in Graham Smith's workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates special designs for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique and personal item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.' This is very different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. 'I realized that I could make weathervanes in many different shapes,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that job for 15 years. Then he and his wife, Liz, decided to change roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his new job. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I really enjoy designing.' Graham has now made over 100 original designs. He works with very fine details and always asks the customer to approve the design before he starts cutting. Graham also keeps many traditional designs because they are popular too. 'People like hand-made things,' Graham says. 'They like to have something a little different.' Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small, rural craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique designs, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients all over the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. 'The price,' he explains, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a special gift.'"
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about what inspired him and his success.

At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans. He is a screenwriter, producer, and wants to be a director. His year started badly when a film project called ""Life and Limb,"" which he had worked on for months, suddenly failed. He was very worried because he hadn't made any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to pay the bank. 

Most people in his situation would have found a job. He could have gone back to working in television or started a TV project he had paused. But instead, he made a risky decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months. 

The idea for the story came from a farrier (a person who shoes horses) he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" Evans was fascinated by this story. He started researching it to write a screenplay, but after his film project failed, he decided to write a book instead.

In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his future. He had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, but now he was in debt and worried about his family.

By August, he had written half of the book and was back home. The bank was pressuring him, and he needed to know if the book was worth finishing. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts and support his family. He had already spent seven months on the book and needed at least two more months to finish it. 

In October, he sent the first 200 pages and a 12-page summary of the book to seven UK publishers. This was just before the Frankfurt Book Fair, a big event for publishers. Within days, his agent called to say they had turned down an offer of $75,000. The agent felt something big was happening.

Soon, the book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans and his family were shocked. They hadn't even sent the book to New York, but somehow it got there. Hollywood studios also wanted it, and they offered $3 million for the film rights.

Evans told me all this while we drank coffee at his home. He said he turned down an offer to write the screenplay for ""The Horse Whisperer."" He didn't want to ruin the fairy tale by becoming an employee of the people who paid him so much. He would be involved in the film, but not too closely. 

The success of his novel also brought new interest in his film ""Life and Limb,"" but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. He thought it would be wise to write another novel."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Bobby Fischer is trying to prove himself again, but age is not on his side. Chess is now a game for younger people. After 20 years away from chess, Bobby Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game with a brilliant move, but he is not the same as he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, not in practice, and not in good shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now it is more professional. Winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intelligence. The game is very intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose. Now, games last longer and are played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board. Players must prepare well before matches, especially because computers have changed chess a lot. A small computer can store one million chess games and help players study their opponents. In a recent match, players used teams to find weaknesses in each other's games. The opening moves are now studied very carefully. Being well-prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, there are more top players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success needs both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. Losing concentration can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the pressure. The end of the game can be a fast 'time scramble', where players have only seconds to make moves. They must move quickly and press the clock with great skill. These moments are not for thinkers; they are a battle of nerves and willpower. At the top level, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to rest. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to play again the next day. Most tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day. There is a tournament circuit all year round. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to stop because both players were too tired. Karpov lost about 10kg in weight. Can Fischer beat these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his leaving chess in 1972 hard to understand. But it made him a legend. If he returned for money, he will earn a lot. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer came back to prove he is still the best, losing could be very sad for him.'"

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.

**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three plays that critics love. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's a low-budget film, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before writing ""Peaches,"" he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know it's difficult. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very exciting.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but working with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show was very successful, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to be successful. Encouraged by his mother, he went from playing lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for more praise, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released soon. ""The record company has a different idea of good sales than I do,"" he says. ""They talk about a big hit, but I have no idea. If two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to get into the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won many prizes, awards, and academic honors. He is well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings for the past six years. Now his first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became unhappy with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theater, I decided I should."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry getting so much praise, moving into novels is brave. ""There's a structure with my poetry, and less chance to make big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad words. My main goal is not to just produce work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,"**A.** Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but doesn't wear them often because she doesn't want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance stories and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knobbly knees might stop her from finding love. However, she always stays hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with a lot of energy, like an old silent movie, with chapter titles such as 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'

**B.** This story is about the start and almost end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart but weak child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of small shops, old cars, and, of course, the radio.

**C.** In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. So, when successful professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a beautiful Russian poet, he talks to his wife's ex-husband about it. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she also wants his help to free her brother from prison. The author makes these problems interesting by using humor and carefully examining relationships. The story is enjoyable, smart, and funny.

**D.** Two pairs of best friends—two women and two men—meet in London during the 1960s and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, an American businessman named James Hudson, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is good. This book is long and detailed, allowing readers to really get to know the characters.

**E.** Written by a top American fiction writer, this funny and caring story is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a mistake and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is becoming an unusual bachelor surrounded by the mess of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the sweet relationship Ian builds with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a lovely, warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four experts talk about international volunteer work.

**A.** It's hard to say that volunteer work directly helps development a lot. Volunteer tourists often help build homes or schools, but they pay a lot of money to do this. If this money was given directly to local communities, it could pay for more work than one volunteer can do. This is especially true for gap year students, who usually don't have special skills or experience. Many studies question if gap year volunteering is really about helping others or if it's more about young people wanting to improve their own careers. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and caring in their future lives and jobs.

**B.** Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, help solve conflicts, and increase participation in global issues. It can also create international friendships among regular people. In this way, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. But if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, they might gain international experience and career benefits, while the communities they visit might not gain much. These volunteers might use the experience to advance personally, rather than truly helping the communities.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that benefits the volunteer more than the community. It can be about personal gain for wealthy Westerners. At its best, it benefits both volunteers and the communities, allowing for an exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Volunteering can also make people more aware of and committed to fighting poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others in small ways. This can seem positive, especially when people don't trust big governments or businesses. However, it can also ignore the need for bigger changes and reduce development to small acts of charity. While volunteering is a good act, when it's promoted as sustainable development, it can weaken the real discussion about development. Volunteer tourism can sometimes avoid addressing the real social issues and inequalities in the world."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us listen to the radio when we wake up, and we often need something to help us get out of bed. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios.

One model has a 'dual alarm function.' I thought it would let you snooze and then wake up again, but it actually lets you set two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model is about the same price as another one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a good deal. You can fall asleep to your own music and wake up without news. We all liked the radio's quality, but it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn't work.

This model was the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock on his test model got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. However, the buttons felt like piano keys, and I accidentally pressed them too much. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don't have to reset it if someone unplugs it. We all liked this feature, but setting it up was hard. Once we learned how, we felt 'cool' and sophisticated.

Tom Granger thought the model with a built-in lamp was 'tacky.' You have to pull the light out of its socket to use it, which made him question its quality. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work, and the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but found the radio hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and annoying. Surprisingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people, one model has a bright casing and a matching strap. Tom Granger and I liked it because it stands out. It was the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes, which Paul Bridges found ridiculous. He said it was 'fiddly' and 'useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was 'standard' and took up little space. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed the buttons correctly. He admitted that radios have improved because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was basic, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer worked well and got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not originally from America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened. This makes their spines stick out to protect them. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines because they need to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have to. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in a hole in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Being successful in sports is difficult for everyone, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competitions take up a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming obstacles and setting new records. Here, we talk to some talented British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

""I love the feeling of flying through the air and landing smoothly, but it can be scary. Sometimes the weather is bad, but you just have to keep going. We train for ten months a year, so it's hard to have a career outside skiing. You miss out on a lot of social life and friends, but I chose this. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated the same - it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won because I was the fastest, even though I had never cycled before! I earn well as a professional, and cycling has many opportunities for sponsorships. However, I worry people might think I succeed because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling and train at least four hours a day, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitment.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

""Rowing is hard for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most start at 19 or 20, making it harder to succeed internationally. Coaches often stay for only a year, so there's little consistency, and the women's team is disorganized. But it's fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not knowing how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was stubborn and didn't like others controlling me. Now, I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the hardest due to pain. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours a day with only three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, as my sponsorship money was running out. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as risky.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

""Some men have big egos when driving. When I do well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its downsides. At corners, men think, 'I have to beat her,' so I've had many bumps! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have raced since the 1920s and were seen as unusual. It's great that more women are racing now. I love saloon car racing because I aim for perfection, always trying for a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous energy before a race, and you push yourself hard. I've asked myself why I do it. The reasons are: a) I'm happier when I'm fit, b) I'm lazy at heart and need to push myself, c) racing is social. Men and women usually compete together, but media coverage focuses mostly on men. The prize money isn't as good for women, but we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission to work on this."""
CAE_34,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso

Richard Cork remembers the day he met the famous artist Picasso. At 18 years old, Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He was out of money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while eating at a restaurant, he saw Picasso, who was 78 years old, sitting with his wife and friends. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him.

Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard approached Picasso and offered his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed his name and added a drawing on the page. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, using an American woman at the table to help translate.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was encouraged to go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard started drawing. Picasso noticed and made funny faces to make it difficult for Richard. Eventually, Picasso stopped and let Richard draw him properly. Richard was amazed by Picasso's youthful appearance and intense eyes.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the drawing. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and then decided to draw Richard. In a few quick strokes, Picasso created a playful drawing of Richard. Richard asked Picasso to sign it, but Picasso said he had already given his signature.

Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. It was a memorable experience for him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that stores use to make you spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers love fresh products. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store look fresh. They might also have a bakery inside, so the smell of fresh bread fills the air. The store might use green colors because people think of green as fresh. Most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh, but they use these tricks to create a fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

Where products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas of the store are most popular. They put the most profitable or fast-selling products there. Products at eye level sell better, so companies want their items on these shelves. Special offers in big bins attract people who love bargains. Stores also place related items together, like salad dressings near salads, to encourage more buying.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets put basic items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers have to walk past other tempting products. Chain stores do the same with their popular items, placing them far from the entrance. They hope loyal customers will look for these items and see other products along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**

Some chain stores, like Next, have changed how they display products. Instead of having lots of cheap items, they show fewer items to make them seem special. This makes the store look like a boutique. Even though Next's clothes are mass-produced like others, their store design makes them seem exclusive.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets use this by selling a mix of cheap and expensive items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as 'loss leaders.' They also buy in large quantities to get discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 can make a difference. This also helps reduce theft because staff have to record the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use lighting that looks like natural light, so clothes look the same as they would outside. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh food look better.

**H. Walk This Way**

Some chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One type of carpet shows the path through the store, and another type marks sales areas. This is called the 'Yellow Brick Road.' Not all shoppers follow these paths, so stores like Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas to encourage people to explore.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

When you enter a supermarket, you might see big photos of delicious food. This is very tempting, especially if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that show ads as you shop. These ads are triggered by sensors and aim to increase impulse buying, boosting sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a famous mountaineer, is best known for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their trip in a book called ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed, anchored, and then went to shore to practice climbing. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in difficult climbing conditions. When they reached a big drop, Chris showed Robin how to climb down safely. Robin, used to climbing down ropes on his boat, managed to lower himself safely.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Although the skipper usually makes all decisions, Robin asked for everyone's opinion first. Chris found sailing boring and preferred being on land, while Robin enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin didn't really need his help.

The crew was crowded on a small yacht, with six people on a boat meant for four. In Greenland, when it was Chris's turn to lead, he found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety while climbing. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was more challenging than Chris expected. Robin, not a natural climber, impressed Chris with his efforts. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours but had to turn back. Robin trusted Chris completely and was willing to try again despite worrying about the boat.

The only time Chris and Robin almost had a problem was on the way home. Chris was supposed to take a watch shift at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him, thinking he could handle it alone. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him that wasn't true. By the end of the Greenland trip, Chris realized that Robin, despite his tough exterior, was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, they spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, people in Switzerland and Italy left apple remains near their homes. They even stored apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and they brought this knowledge to Britain. They also learned how to make cider. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but they didn't grow well in Britain. The Normans brought better varieties, and British monks developed new types of apples. Many Western apples come from these varieties.

**Medieval Apples (1200)**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known for its pear-like shape, was a favorite dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets. However, apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and wars. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple growing. Harris brought back many apple grafts, including the famous Pippins, and started a modern orchard in Kent.

**Apples Abroad (1750)**  
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed,' planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was known for his love of apple trees and his kindness.

**Modern Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple growing from a dead tree. He called it 'Hawkey,' but it became known as 'Delicious' after a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious, delicious!"" It became one of the most popular apples worldwide. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith discovered another famous apple. Known as 'Granny Smith,' she found a new apple tree growing from discarded fruit. This tree produced the first major crop of green apples, now famous worldwide.

**Uniformity in Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most commercial apples come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, not for taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as it reduces the gene pool. While some gardeners in the UK keep old apple varieties alive, many have been lost in the US. Consumers are now asking for more variety. We need to protect natural diversity in apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British long-distance runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located in Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya, which is covered in glaciers. For three years, Richard trained in Kenya but never with Kenyan runners. On his fourth trip, he changed this. He competed in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in a world championship race. Training at high altitudes helps runners because it increases red blood cells, which carry oxygen better. This is one reason Kenyan runners are so successful.

Richard's first race in Africa was an international cross-country race in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience because 41 runners finished ahead of him, and most were Kenyan. He realized that Kenyan success is not just due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to running. They run with ease, eat simple foods, and enjoy competing. Richard wanted to know how they train.

At the training camp, located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, Richard found out. The camp is basic, with athletes living in simple dormitories. Their day includes three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner include ugali, stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya.

Richard left the camp with a new appreciation for Kenyan runners. Their success is not just about genetics, upbringing, or altitude. It might be the simple lifestyle, hard training, and passion for success that make them the best in the world at distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is having problems. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising started to drop in 1989, even before the recession got serious. The problems with advertising are deeper, and it's happening all over the world. The truth is, advertising hasn't kept up with how fast the economy is changing. Advertisers like to think about big markets and big media, but as more brands and media have appeared, target markets have become smaller. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Think about how you shop. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or 50 items. Many of these won't be advertised brands; some will be the same brand bought multiple times. You might only buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 products in the store. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. Big items like appliances? Maybe a dozen a year. Cars? If you have a new car, it's likely from your employer. If not, you buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with candy, medicine, tools, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys 400 of those 9,500, and not all because of ads. That's about 4 percent. So, you could say 96 percent of advertising is wasted, but no one knows which 96 percent. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about one in 16 (6 percent), so the other 15 (94 percent) seem wasted.

You might think you're not affected by advertising, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. It's silly to think everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste can't be avoided. But advertising can still be cost-effective. Many ads have shown it works. Advertising needs to reach many people to find the right few, because advertisers can't know who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to reach many people.

However, waste is still a problem. With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail never gets a 100 percent response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. This can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media. They could contact people directly. This is true for all ads, from soft drinks to important announcements.

Any advertiser who gets one million new customers (2 percent of adults) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million extra customers. So, any ad campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population is very successful. But that's still a small part of the population. The best way to reach them might be through mass media, but for advertising to improve, its message needs to be more focused than ever before."
CAE_43,"Title: Britain's Greenest Home

Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Southwell is known for its ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, which has 'green' men carved into its decoration. But it also has Britain's greenest house, called the 'autonomous house', built by Robert and Brenda Vale.

The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their waste into garden compost, and heat their house with heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with their three children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and fits well with the town's old buildings. It even got approval from planners because it blends in with the conservation area.

The house is very quiet inside because it is super-insulated with special windows. When you enter, you must take off your shoes, and it feels very peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens special vents and windows to let in fresh air because the house is very well sealed. Even the cats have their own special door.

The Vales, who teach architecture, have been interested in the environment for a long time. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s. They wanted to build a house that does not produce carbon dioxide and does not use mains water. They use composting toilets, collect rainwater, and use copper gutters to keep the water clean. They do not have a dishwasher because they do not want to use strong detergents.

The Vales wanted to show that it is possible to have an environmentally-friendly house without living in the dark ages. The house looks a bit medieval because of its design, but it is modern in its function. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, they used very little electricity, costing about 70p a day. Soon, they will have solar panels to generate even more electricity, enough to charge an electric car.

The only heating in the house is a small wood-burning stove, which they rarely use. In winter, the house stays warm because there are no draughts and everything inside is the same temperature. Robert says that people used to be comfortable at lower temperatures because of their clothing.

The house is simple and low-tech, with most materials bought from local suppliers and built by local workers. This made it cheap to build, costing the same as low-cost housing. However, commercial builders are not interested in this idea."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical and scientific person. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were real proof that fairies existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are very beautiful. But the simple trick shows that a basic idea about photography, that the camera cannot lie, is not true. Cameras can lie, and they always could. Today, we know that computer software lets us change our digital photos, and it is not true that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, when cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Blacksmiths

Iron has always been important to people, and those who work with it, called blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern buildings rarely used decorative ironwork. But in the past 10 years, there has been a revival due to more interest in decorative architecture and new ideas in interior design. Still, much of the work looks old-fashioned, with many products being called 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy design stores often sell rusty candlesticks with decorations.

Fortunately, there are new options, and several events aim to promote blacksmithing. One event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says we might be entering a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now. Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it easily. Dawson says, 'These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.'

About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most of the money will go to the makers, but some will help promote good ironwork. Dawson's own pieces include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says his style comes from letting steel bend and flow when it's hot, like drawing with metal in space.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's soft when hot but becomes hard when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles inspired by castles in horror films.

CAE_14,"Title: The Day I Quit Smoking

I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It even surprised me. 

I attended a stop-smoking session that combined group therapy and hypnotherapy. This happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to quit smoking, and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the pressure from people who were against smoking. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family, so I didn't feel sick or cough. I even thought I got over colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On a regular Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" in Birmingham. I was there to write an article about other people trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't try to stop myself because I'm here to write, not to quit. It wouldn't be fair to expect your method to work on me."" I enjoyed smoking and it made me happy. The counselor seemed to understand something I didn't.

We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't really want to, and neither did the others. The messages about quitting smoking started to make sense to me. Just like smoking was a challenge because people were against it, quitting started to feel like a good idea. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I also achieve other things?

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two. I only felt it for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I needed nicotine to meet deadlines, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, spending weekend mornings at home was the hardest part, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was something to do.

Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is different, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but not many people in Britain know her name. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's biography, finds this surprising. If Hodgkin had won a Nobel Prize in literature, she would be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the progress of women's education and the spread of science around the world.

When Ferry started her research, she read scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, a famous chemist and friend of Hodgkin. However, Ferry couldn't find any books about Pauling in her local bookshop. This made her realize that people in Britain might not find scientists' lives interesting, even if they are very important.

Some people think that scientists' lives are boring to read about. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, once said that scientists' lives are not exciting. This view makes it hard for publishers to sell books about scientists. There is a belief that arts and sciences are very different, which affects how scientists are seen in biographies. Only the most famous scientists are usually written about.

However, scientists' lives can be just as interesting as those of artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists avoid media attention because they don't want to seem like they are promoting themselves. This can make science seem less interesting to young people and the public.

Fortunately, things are changing. Scientists are now appearing more in public, not just in scientific interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car advertisements. These activities help people see scientists as real people.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be serious and not very interesting, often ignoring the scientist's personal life. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which was funny and touching. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are shown with their personal flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin was very dedicated to her scientific work. She solved the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and later insulin in 1969. She also had three children and a husband who was often away for his work as a historian. Her personal life may not seem important to her science, but it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.

Hodgkin's life is interesting to many people, not just because of her science. Her passion for scientific discovery was a big part of her life. Writing about this passion is a challenge for biographers because many readers don't have the scientific background to understand complex ideas easily. It's sad that many educated people don't know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they are part of our rich heritage."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Special Skill

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability called a 'sixth sense'. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.

This skill, called dowsing, helps find water, minerals, and lost things underground. People have different ideas about how it works. Some think it is about magnetism, while others think it is spiritual. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers, like Margaret, might be very good at feeling these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.

In recent years, there has been a lot of work for the Wilkins because of droughts. At one point, they had a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other customers have holiday homes far from water pipes, or they are building golf courses.

Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and not near any waste. The water they find is in cracks of hard rock, which keeps it clean. But in Cornwall, where they work, there is a lot of iron, so they have to be careful. They also need electricity to run the pump, so the well should be near power supplies.

To find water, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She moves the pendulum over the map, and it swings when there is water. Then she walks over the land with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. She holds the stick with both hands, and when water is below, the stick moves up. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If they are a little off, they might miss the water. Her husband also checks the area, and they must agree on where to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking.

Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition. Many people are interested in how she does it. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This means she has a special way of understanding the land. Without this skill, her family could not run their well-drilling business successfully year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different. We arranged this for four people. Read about their experiences.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.

Amanda had never been in a place like the restaurant before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. It was very different from her hometown. She had to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand in just 15 minutes. The other waitresses made it look easy, but Amanda dropped the drinks, and they spilled everywhere. She was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.

By 11:30 am, there was already a line of people waiting to get in, and Amanda felt nervous. She was worried about remembering all the orders, but everything was automated, so it wasn't a problem. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she couldn't get used to the loud music. She had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was very tired and wanted to soak her feet in hot water. She was surprised when a waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized that waitressing is tiring and not as easy as she thought. She was glad to go back to her children, which seemed easier after waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for the day. She knew Amanda's daughters could be cheeky, but she thought she could handle it. She had to get the girls dressed and fed, drop Sophie at school, and Katie at nursery. She thought she would have some free time, but Amanda left her a note with chores like making beds, cleaning, and doing laundry.

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. When Sophie came home from school, the girls started jumping on the sofa and screaming. Cindy thought they would get tired, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to look after two small children and realized how much responsibility it is. Even though it was tiring, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, who is 42 and runs a dairy farm, swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher.

On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She was nervous about what to wear to school. At the school assembly, she hoped she blended in with the 400 pupils. She helped with a maths class and a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but found out teachers only have about five minutes to eat. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a reading lesson and a French lesson, where the children practiced their French with her. Finally, there was a Physical Education class. Rosemary found it hard to stand in front of the class and speak. She decided she preferred farming, even though teachers get more holidays.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am and found out Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell. Hilary spent the morning in the ice cream shop, bottling milk and packing ice cream. She had to resist tasting the treats.

At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. If sheep are left on their backs for too long, they can die. After feeding the calves, she started milking the cows, which took two and a half hours. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children at school. She realized that farming is hard work with little time off. Rosemary only gets about three days of holiday a year. Farming seems romantic, but it's tough, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, from a small town in southern Sweden, is one of them. At 30 years old, he is now a famous trumpet player. His music includes not only old concertos from the baroque and classical periods but also new works. When you meet him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV show talked about his work and life, showing parts filmed in Sweden and London.

Hakan was born near Malmo, and his career started because of a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong but wasn't musical, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved it and played all the time. His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, who was a talented musician in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. Bo saw Hakan's natural talent right away. Hakan is grateful for having such a great teacher who loved the trumpet and was always learning more about it.

Hakan explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument with imperfections, and you can't find two mouthpieces that are exactly the same. He learned to work with these imperfections and make them part of his music. Even as a child, people could recognize his unique sound. Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter who also focused on solo performances. Hakan's parents supported his dream to become a professional trumpet player.

At 15, Hakan needed to decide where to study. America was too far and seemed dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised him against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hakan knew he played better than others his age, but it was during a competition in Paris at 17 that he realized he had a special gift for connecting with people through music. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hakan only prepared for the first round but made it to the final. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and noticed that people listened to him, even if he thought he didn't play perfectly.

Hakan is realistic about his talent and doesn't try to explain his ability to connect with audiences, saying that trying to explain it might ruin it. He believes the power of music is in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**A.** The story of Tristan Smith takes place in the made-up country of Efica. It is a special story about human power, history, and humor.

CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical workday looks like.

**A. The Brain Surgeon**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34

**Anne's Day:**  
Anne wakes up at 6:30 am, goes to the gym at 7 am, and starts work at 8 am. She begins operating at 8:30 am. She operates all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most operations take three hours, but some can last all day. Sometimes, she works for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. She doesn't feel stressed while operating, but she worries about the next day's work. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it feels great. From 10 am to 1 pm, she talks to patients about their operations. She enjoys this and finds it easy to talk to them. If patients get upset, she comforts them, but time can be tight. She leaves work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, she is on call and carries a pager. On holidays, she worries about her patients for the first three days and dreams about operating at night. She finds it hard to relax.

**B. The Senior Designer**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31

**Marita's Day:**  
Marita wakes up at 7:45 am, leaves home by 8:20 am, takes the train, and arrives at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, her team meets to discuss their work and any problems. Her team includes three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of her work is design; the rest is production. She gets a brief from the client and spends three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting her ideas to the client and getting approval, she works on budgets and hires photographers and illustrators. She communicates with printers to ensure everything is on time. Managing people is a big part of her job. She has to communicate well with many people and give clear instructions. She assembles everything and sends it to the printers. Managing several projects at once can be stressful. Deadlines are always near, and her day has no set structure. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and she tries to go out. If not, she eats sandwiches and works through lunch. It's a great feeling when a client likes her designs, but disappointing if the work is rejected. She gets home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. She finds it hard to relax after work, especially when busy.

**C. The Chauffeur**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42

**Linda's Day:**  
Linda usually wakes up at 7 am, but two or three times a week, she meets early flights and wakes up between 4:30 am and 5 am. Around 10:30 or 11 am, she might go for a bike ride or swim. Since driving is a sitting job, she watches her diet and exercises carefully. She has a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask her for restaurant or shop recommendations, so she needs to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, so she can check routes in advance. Not all passengers are polite; some are rude. But most are well-behaved, and she has a good relationship with regular clients. Sometimes she hears conversations in the car and has to focus on driving. The press has tried to get her to talk about clients, but she doesn't. She works seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and tries not to get too tired. She aims to be in bed by 11 pm.

**D. The Landscape Gardener**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27

**Tracy's Day:**  
Tracy wakes up at 7 am, leaves home at 7:30 am, and goes to her first job. She and her assistant mostly maintain gardens they designed. They do some commercial work, but mostly private gardens. They spend about an hour and a half at each house. Around 11 am, they get hungry and go to a cafe for breakfast. In summer, she may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. Her business office is at home, so she checks messages and calls when she returns. If someone wants their garden landscaped, she arranges a meeting in the evening. They use old materials to make gardens look old. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren't great. It's satisfying to see a garden completed and blooming. It's hard to relax in the evenings because she hears the business phone. She sleeps well because the work is physical and tiring. She isn't very strong but is fit. The job is tough physically but allows creativity.

**E. The Civil Engineer**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27

**Zena's Day:**  
Zena arrives at the site by 8:30 am. She is an assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a wall to prevent cars from driving into a quarry. She checks that contractors follow the schedule and safety rules and have minimal environmental impact. She coordinates site professionals and solves problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so she first checks with the clerk of works about what happened since she left. Her day depends on this information. She reviews paperwork and answers design questions. Lunch is usually half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but she often eats on the go. When contractors are on break, it's easier to check the site. Checking their work can cause conflict, so she keeps an open relationship with them. She sees the duty resident engineer once a day but acts immediately if something important happens. She usually leaves the site at 6 pm and is always on call."
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7.30 am. I manage programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards program in big European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I handle all the advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future projects. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10.00 am and go through the mail, which includes 10 to 20 demo tapes, letters from producers, and concert information. The phone starts ringing at 10.30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be helpful because it's important work for the artists. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending. I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and often go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After a concert, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life is mostly related to work, and I often get home at 1.00 am, where I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9.30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and selling furniture, knowing it's going to a good home. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business. I visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts once a month and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm and take about an hour to relax.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work in shifts, and on early shifts, I leave home at 6.00 am. At 7.00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working for about an hour and a half at a station, then taking a break before returning to a different station. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I can read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am. It's important to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to take sick leave if needed. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and maybe even a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I make sure someone is at the till and organize staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating if they expect me to gather many books for them. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm, publishers' representatives visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the coming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When we feature a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8.45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in the region I cover. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential problems. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am, so I work quickly. I type stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make changes before they go online. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay updated. I leave work around 6.00 pm. It's hard to relax, and I'm often awake at 1.00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: How to Be a Good Leader at Work**

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader is someone who inspires others and helps bring change. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about making things happen with people who are as excited as you are. Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. Dixon says, ""It's about saying 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""

B. **Everyone Can Be a Leader**  
John van Maurik, who teaches leadership, says many people have more leadership potential than they know. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing your hidden talents. We are all born with the ability to lead; we just need the right situation to grow. We often see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, but it can also be important in our own workplaces. Leadership is now seen as very important for good management.

C. **Think About Your Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might have been good at meeting goals and deadlines. But how did they do it? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first was a good leader; the second was a bad manager.

D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, who wrote ""Leadership Rules,"" says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a country.

E. **Improve Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired, use that energy to lead.  
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.  
- Sometimes you need to be firm. Try different styles. If you usually ask for others' opinions, try taking the lead. See how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to beat them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better.

F. **Developing Leadership**  
- Leadership doesn't just happen. It grows from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don't expect your way of leading to work right away. It might not be liked by everyone. Keep improving your communication skills. Your ideas and achievements are important.  
- Be visible and available to those who matter. But remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It's about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of heroes from old movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the great filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release is based on the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal. Directed by Andrew Marton, it is different from Terrence Malick's new film. Marton's version is a more traditional war movie and focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. While Malick's film is more complex, Marton's has its good moments. The flashback scene, where the soldier dreams of his wife, is done with a harshness that might work better than Malick's softer style.

**C. On Guard**  
This film is loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel. It's a fun and entertaining adventure with musketeers. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, and Vincent Perez is an energetic hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil is a bit too serious for this type of movie, but he still has good moments as a swordsman. The film uses costume-drama clichés with so much wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film is a serious story. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is very strict when evicting tenants. The story focuses on his difficult relationship with his son, but the filmmakers seem more interested in showing the period details than exploring the story's dark themes.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video shows director Leone's skills very well. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music makes it exciting again. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act without much scruple in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This war epic boasts 'forty-eight international stars' and is three hours long. With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow for both the characters and the audience. Logistically, it's impressive, but it needs a big screen to be fully appreciated. On video, it loses some of its impact."

CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to do it again someday. But you know how life goes... I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. But I slowly realized I was giving up my happiness for my salary. When I quit my job, it felt like I was in control of my life again. Now, I have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I'm not in a relationship, and I don't have big career goals. I feel like I should enjoy this freedom, even for my friends' sake! Why am I so nervous? First, it's about making the necessary plans. How could I let someone else live in my home? And how would I organize the rental? Also, I had to decide where to go. I'm really bad at making decisions and am already weeks behind my plan. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Cutting emotional ties makes it even harder. I'm delaying because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among young backpackers just out of school and university? Maybe not. I've found that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives behind and travel. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebooks, says more people realize that adventure is possible: 'People who always say ""I wish I had that chance"" are realizing they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.' For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have one last adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a thought in your mind that, ""OK, I'm not moving up in my career, I'll be in the same place when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a way to show my defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, the year he spent traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things. I went away because I needed to change this and get rid of this approach to have a normal life as a civilian.' While there are many reasons to travel at my age, there seem to be common factors. 'We have a more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Big companies are even allowing career breaks. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they'll come back rather than work for a competitor.' For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, more people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. 'If you're not happy with what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's not just about sticking with it. Now people know that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to rethink and consider your life.' Is wanting to travel just another example of my generation not wanting to grow up? Jennifer Cox doesn't think so. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less worried about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to get things I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's the thought of leaving behind a comfortable routine - just going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and sitting down with a cup of coffee.' I share Ben's worries about leaving behind an easy life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is common. There's often a reason, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to go and do it.' It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. Whatever happens, I'll be happy knowing I took control of my life. And in that, I'm sure I speak for all of us older backpackers."""
CAE_42,"Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her journalism career and felt out of touch with new technology. She shares how she turned her home into a good place to work. When she turned 37, she realized she needed to restart her career in journalism, which seemed outdated. Her resume showed she was stuck in the 1980s, using old technology like typewriters. She felt unqualified for jobs that required computer skills, like desktop publishing. She was not good with technology, even simple things like calculators or video timers.

Georgina thought it would be hard to go back to work before her children grew up. But then she entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package for her family. They received a laptop for her husband and a personal computer for everyone. They quickly learned about the Internet and started using terms like cyberspace and surfing. The children stopped watching TV, and Georgina set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem to connect to the Internet. She could work from home and still take her children to school.

The children were comfortable with computers because they used them at school. Georgina was more cautious, worried she might lose her work by pressing the wrong button. But she learned the basic skills she needed, finding it logical and easy. She started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month, and felt happy to have the best of both worlds.

The computer helped her become organized, especially with office tasks. She used spreadsheets to track income and expenses and saved time with pre-formatted invoices and letterheads. Being online allowed her to research stories and connect with other journalists worldwide. However, working from home also had downsides, like feeling isolated and dealing with household distractions. There were also arguments over who got to use the computer when the children were home.

Many people in her area bought multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and work. A new type of home business was growing, allowing people to avoid commuting to the city. A report on PC usage in UK homes described the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated, with most owning a personal computer and many having a CD-ROM and modem. Georgina felt she was ahead of the trend and hoped to one day email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publish her own magazine from home. It seemed that the possibilities were endless."
CAE_59,"The Tartan Museum

The new Museum of Scotland has modern buildings that look very different from the old city of Edinburgh. But are the things inside the museum as interesting? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You can't miss the museum. It stands out on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh with its big, yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some loved it, calling it a 'masterpiece', while others were not sure or didn't like it at all. This winter, as the museum is about to open, people might feel the same way about the exhibitions inside.

The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history. It has important objects like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver. The museum does not just focus on national pride. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to visit again.

Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no fake scenes or imagined stories. The museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some computers to tell the stories of the objects.

Inside the museum, the spaces are impressive. The galleries are different sizes and shapes, with pale walls that look like stone and deep display cases. Light comes in through narrow windows and from the roof. There is space to enjoy each item.

The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of 9- to 12-year-olds from all over Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a special hands-on area for kids.

On the top floor, there is a Twentieth Century gallery. It will change every three years and shows objects that people in Scotland think are important, like an electric guitar, televisions, and favorite toys. This idea is fun, but it might not seem very serious. It could feel more meaningful when a computer display of personal stories starts next week.

Dr. Clarke believes that objects help us understand the past better than anything else. The modern architecture of the museum looks great from the inside, but whether it fits in with the old city is another question."
CAE_54,"The end of print newspapers might take a long time. Change can be scary for some people, but the word ""transition"" makes it sound easier. Transition means moving smoothly from the present to the future. However, the move from print newspapers to online news is not smooth. Many people think it will happen because print sales are going down while visits to newspaper websites are going up. For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% in a year, but their website visits are increasing.

However, the situation is not the same everywhere. The World Association of Newspapers says that global newspaper sales actually went up by 1.1% last year, thanks to more sales in Asia. In the West, sales went down, but news magazines saw a 5.4% increase. Books are also interesting. E-readers like Kindle are selling well, but the sales of physical books only went down by 0.4%. This shows that people are using both screens and paper.

The idea that young people are not reading newspapers is not true. Almost 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main national newspapers. In Europe, the situation is different in each country. In Britain, print sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop was only 7%, and in France, it was just 3.1%.

In the past, people thought that online ads would make online newspapers successful. But now, online ad revenue is going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online content. The best way to get people to pay is to offer both print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print ads make much more money than online ads. This is not easy for newspaper companies because running both print and online editions is expensive. But print still helps newspapers stay well-known, while online, it is harder to get noticed."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are very interesting to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more interesting than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be hard. Besides thinking about the camera settings and artistic style, the photographer must pay attention to people's actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**

When taking group photos, avoid having people stand in straight lines. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible, or you can take the photo from a higher position.

**B. Posing for Pictures**

People often don't act naturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff and unnatural. Help them relax by suggesting they find a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**

Don't pretend you are not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can make people uncomfortable. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they protest a little at first. They might feel self-conscious, so you may need to guide them. A picture can be ruined if the person is looking away without focus.

**D. Eye Contact**

A photo is more powerful if the person looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the camera lens. They don't have to smile, but this creates a strong effect. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**

Instead of direct eye contact, the person can focus on something in the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can see what they are looking at. Candid shots, where the person doesn't know they are being photographed, can be very interesting. The expression is important in these photos.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**

Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about the person in the photo. A laughing child makes the viewer smile, while a sad face makes the viewer feel sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. These are a universal visual language.

**G. Situation Interest**

Photos that show a person with their background can be very interesting. The background can give more information about the person. Make sure the background doesn't distract from the person. You can blur the background or use a wide-angle lens to make the person stand out.

**H. Interaction**

When two or more people are interacting, there are great opportunities for photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams working together make good pictures. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture how one person reacts to another with expressions or gestures.

**I. People and Places**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays or trips to show where they visited. To take a good picture, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera so they are in the foreground without blocking the background. A slightly higher camera position can help. A good photo balances the people and the place.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose with a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all posed. Candid photos of events are more lively. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. Joanna Watt interviews her in this article.

Sarah Janson is different from many artists because she doesn't sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes the artwork is more important than the artist. Sarah is very humble and sometimes acts like her paintings create themselves. This makes her a bit shy during interviews. She even feels uncomfortable being photographed for the magazine.

Later, in her living room, which is full of art, Sarah becomes more relaxed and the interview turns fun and interesting. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she wasn't happy with illustration, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to try trompe-l'oeil, and she loved it. She decided to start her own business, feeling she was on the right path.

Sarah's skills in observing and focusing on details, learned from illustrating, are very important for trompe-l'oeil. She says you can't really be taught trompe-l'oeil; it's about observing life. She believes she is still learning and says that if you think you know everything, it's time to stop. Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, like not being able to paint bread well, and she struggles with math. When she had to paint a big ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she found the measurements confusing and doubted herself.

Sarah often talks about her work as if someone else did it. Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special and better than many others who try this art. She has done many important projects for companies and private clients. Her work is often inspired by architecture. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and a corridor that seems to lead to more rooms.

Trompe-l'oeil can lose its charm once people understand the trick, so Sarah makes sure her work keeps people interested and sparks their imagination. She believes the art should be personal to the client. Sarah enjoys working with clients and getting ideas from them. She listens to their wishes and tries to understand their imagination. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.

Sarah appreciates her clients and is thankful for those who trust her with their walls. They are happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she doesn't like to boast about her talent. She says, ""I don't like to shout about myself,"" and believes her work should be quiet and not loud. But her work is so good that it deserves more attention, even if she doesn't want to brag about it."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

**A** The way we are judged at work is changing. It's not just about how smart we are or our training, but also how we handle ourselves and others. This new way of judging is important for deciding who gets hired or promoted. It helps predict who will do well and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs too. They are not about doing well in exams. Instead, they focus on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence.

**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, so personal qualities are important at work. These qualities have been called different names like 'character' and 'soft skills'. Now, they are known as 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage your own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. Emotional intelligence is not just about being nice. Sometimes it means telling someone the hard truth. It also means managing feelings so people can work well together.

**C** Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. Some people succeed without it, but as work becomes more team-based, companies that have employees with good emotional intelligence do better. In today's workplace, teamwork and customer focus are important, and emotional intelligence is essential for success everywhere.

**D** Unlike IQ, which doesn't change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. Studies show that people get better at handling emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others as they get older. This growth is called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can add these skills to help us succeed. This is important when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for all problems, but ignoring it can make things harder."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed how people share these photos. Now, news often appears first on social networks, and some journalists use these images when events happen quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used these photos without asking for permission. There is a rule that says images on social media can be used without permission if there is a very good reason or if it is important for the public. However, people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take a photo or video of a news event. This means that user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. But, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people are paid for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture's Origins and Use**  
Acupuncture is a part of ancient Chinese medicine and is about 2,000 years old. It includes other practices like using herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is mainly known in the West for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it to help people feel less pain.

**How Acupuncture Works**  
In traditional Chinese medicine, being healthy means your mind, body, and spirit are balanced. Energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), moves through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to organs, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every cell. If Qi is blocked or weak, you might feel sick or weak. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulses, looks at your tongue, and asks about your health and habits to find where Qi is unbalanced. They use thin needles on the skin and sometimes add warmth or pressure to help Qi flow better.

**Acupuncture Points**  
There are over 300 main points on the meridians used in acupuncture. The points might not be near where you feel pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This feeling means the needle has reached the Qi. Needles can be moved by hand or with a machine.

**Scientific Views on Acupuncture**  
Even without believing in traditional Chinese ideas, some doctors agree acupuncture can help with pain. They think it might work by blocking pain signals to the brain or by releasing natural painkillers in the body.

**Types of Pain Treated**  
People with long-term pain often try acupuncture. It is used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in very sick people.

**Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia in surgery started in the 1950s. This showed some doctors outside China that acupuncture could be more than just a mental effect. In China, it is used in many surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia, like feeling sick.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
It is hard to test acupuncture in clinical trials, but some show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with long-term pain. Acupuncturists say it usually takes six or seven visits to feel real relief, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.

**Different Views on Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They spend time finding out what might be causing the pain, like if it is worse in cold or damp weather. This helps decide how to treat the pain with acupuncture.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**  
Some medical professionals are trained in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe their methods can lead to longer-lasting cures. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist who will refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems very confident, like she could be the head of a girls' school, but she is actually quite shy. She says that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is a bit like how she would be if she were a man. Both she and Dalgliesh like to work alone. She needs privacy to write and can do it anywhere as long as she is alone.

P.D. James is very humble and doesn't agree when people say she is Britain's most famous crime writer, even though millions of people read her 12 detective novels. She enjoys reading books by her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also reads male authors like Graham Greene.

P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, Connor Bantry White. Life was difficult because her husband came back from World War II very sick. She had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped by taking care of the children.

She worked in administration for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office in the Police Department and Criminal Law section. While working in forensic science, she got used to seeing dead bodies, but it was the challenge of writing a crime novel that interested her, not death itself. She always wanted to be a writer and liked detective stories. Writing them was a way to learn how to be a serious novelist. She believes that solving a crime in a story brings order and shows the importance of life, even if the person who died was not well-liked. She says nobody really likes violence."
CAE_5,"Text: 'The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting could help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help show certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many big companies now hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of people applying for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, who has been a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can help assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a tricky or honest character.' According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in spotting possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals often have messy handwriting, mostly poorly-shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have stopped developing emotionally. This often shows in very childish handwriting and in writing over letters several times. The person behind the handwriting: examples analyzed by graphologist Patricia Marne. 'I can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable workers.' 'Young male offenders often have very high letters, showing they live in a world of fantasy and dream of success. Graphologists can tell if violence is about to happen, if the writer is under a lot of pressure, and if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict possible suicides.' Heart and lung problems can also appear, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if over time it changes or becomes broken, if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, that could be a sign of something serious.' A big emotional upset can also show in a temporarily changed signature, she says. Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. People whose letters form 'threads' instead of being separate are, apparently, tricky and clever. Those who write mainly in capital letters are trying to hide their true selves. Very light pressure shows sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting - how much the writer has changed from standard script - shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures show inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a call for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronizing attitude. Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this needs to be combined with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. This will happen soon, she believes. 'It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer incorrectly.' Interesting as this may sound, there is little solid evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical of them. They say handwriting is a result of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught - and has no other meaning.'"
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy, healthy team, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions. Office A. Advertising Agency Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open directly to the street. It is hard to see why this space works, but the people, who are part of a small, active team, seem to have few complaints. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This might be the key: a team of seven people have created a happy, home-like work environment without any outside rules. Ergonomist: The furniture here is mixed; no two pieces are the same. Much of it causes bad working positions. Chairs are old, most can't be adjusted, and many are broken. Even though this is not good, the staff have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety helps reduce tiredness, boredom, and muscle problems. Occupational Psychologist: Staff are happy with the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to be alone and focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity. Office B. News Service Building Health Consultant: While the office may not be very exciting, it seems comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and general maintenance are good. This is helped by a No Smoking policy. Ergonomist: I was not surprised to learn that the company had already hired an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space is good, although the layout could be better. But the environment is impersonal and not stimulating, with grey, bare walls. Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years and relationships are okay. The office could be better if desks were arranged to make sharing information easier. Success stories or information on future projects could be displayed on the walls. Office C. Bank Building Health Consultant: An office that gets mixed reactions from those working in it. It feels like being in a glass case, looking at and being looked at by many similar cases. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air did not seem stale. Even standing only 1.5 meters from a smoker, it was not possible to smell the cigarette. Ergonomist: The office area is, unfortunately, very standard and not inspiring. The desks are just okay. Not all chairs used for computer work meet requirements, but this is the user's choice. Computer screens are often on small desk units with lowered keyboard shelves; this is not suitable for modern equipment. Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and are well served by technology. Many communication awards are on display. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet give a slightly serious effect. The office is busy with activity. Office D. Newspaper Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning control is very basic, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered and most people have too little desk space. The office is very dusty -- there are many places for dust to collect. The shed-type roof also collects dust, which, if disturbed, falls on those sitting below. Ergonomist: The furniture looks more suitable for a carpentry workshop than a high-tech industry. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially those shorter than about 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack proper adjustment, and have armrests that stop the user from getting close to the desk. Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. A lot of room for improvement -- the place needs a good clean-up, individual success could be more recognized, air conditioning needs to be improved immediately -- there are many smokers. Few conversations were happening when we visited; everyone seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt a team-working policy.'"
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million pieces every day. Let's see how this old habit became a big business. Each piece of gum has less than ten calories, but it is still considered food. This means it must follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. 

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. But it wasn't always like this. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. 

In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States could buy lumps of spruce resin to chew, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, growing sapodilla trees commercially has not worked well. As the gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were needed.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They walk long distances in very humid conditions to collect sapodilla. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly is especially bad because it lays eggs in the tappers' ears and nose. Despite these risks, chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap. They carry the liquid to a camp where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with a simple diet of maize and local alcohol.

Even though their work is difficult, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. The U.S. used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetic materials to save money and meet demand.

Gum producers are also finding new ways to market their products. They claim gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms and causes decay. Our saliva helps fight this by neutralizing the acid and providing minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural help. Also, 137 square kilometers of America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

CAE_47,"Text: 'The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown checks hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watched her work. Just one minute into her yearly check, things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. The receptionist is telling room prices over the phone to someone who might stay at the hotel. She doesn't know that the real guest she is ignoring is Sue Brown. 'She hasn't even noticed us,' Sue whispers. 'Very poor.' This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't a normal three-star hotel,' she says. 'It has three red stars, and I expect better.' Having red stars means the Globe is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide from the organization she works for. Even before the cold welcome, there was a problem. The way from the car park was through an empty door with a buzzer, then a long, empty hallway to the hotel entrance. 'Not what I expected,' says Sue. Could it get worse? Yes. 'We don't have your booking,' says the receptionist in a friendly voice. That night, 12 of the hotel's 15 rooms are empty. One room is on the top floor. Sue doesn't like it: it's stuffy, and there's a big hole in the wall behind a wardrobe panel. When she started her job, she was known for being tough. 'They called me The Woman in Black,' she remembers, 'which was funny because I never wore black. And I was never too tough.' The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the Globe's manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks scared. Before she says more, he apologizes for the bad smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocked drain,' he says. 'We might have to take up the whole floor.' Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that room. 'Better to take them to the other lounge,' she says. Greaves nods and takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months, and he tries to believe Sue when she says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run. It's not all bad news. She praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who shared notes about the building's 400-year history. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating, so Greaves asks, 'What do we need to do to get three rosettes?' Sue suggests, 'Don't serve a pudding that falls apart.' The hope in Greaves' eyes fades. Sue Brown's job is to say the complaints that other guests are too scared to say. 'Sometimes it's very sensitive. Once, a woman called to say I got her son fired. I just told the truth, that he served me apple pie with his fingers.' She often gets letters accusing her of being rude or asking for bribes. 'You get used to it, but it still hurts,' she says. Sue has to tell the hotel her findings and also send a full written report. The hotels pay to be in the guide. Being chosen for red-star treatment is worth it. Greaves is happy to hear that Sue won't suggest taking away the Globe's red stars. That's the good news. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in the next two months to check if everything is fixed. 'Good,' smiles Greaves, not very convincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.''"
CAE_48,"**Seven Up: Climbing the Seven Summits**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experience of climbing the highest mountain on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this challenge later in life and describes his journey for each mountain.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the top of Mt. Everest. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, even though only Doug was there. Doug thought this was due to lack of oxygen. He was worried about frostbite but felt confident with Dougal. They reached the summit by finding a good climbing rhythm.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
In April 1976, Doug and Dougal climbed Mt. McKinley, known for being dangerous. They carried all their gear on their backs, a first for a new route. The climb was tough, with cold and low air pressure making it feel higher than it was. They reached the summit and felt triumphant.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite planned to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle and struggled to find water. They followed a trail of rubbish to a water source. After a difficult start, they chose a safer route and reached the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, climbed Aconcagua. They met a guide who suggested a less crowded route. Due to time limits, they skipped the Polish Glacier and took the standard path. They reached the summit before dark. Meeting other climbers inspired Doug to consider climbing all Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. The sun was always up, and the air was refreshing. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they reached the summit in 8 hours. The storm limited their view, but they were happy to succeed.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In summer 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. After some acclimatization, they took a cableway to 3,900m and walked to a refuge. They faced strong winds and icy slopes. They thought they reached the summit but had to continue further. They returned to the refuge as night fell.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
Doug's team aimed to find a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they started climbing on May 12. The weather improved, and they reached the summit by 11 am. This was Doug's seventh summit, completing his mission."

Style is important in our lives today, from clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley talks about the fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**

Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He suggests choosing simpler styles instead of traditional, stiff, or frilly dresses. Ingham started drawing and designing wedding dresses when he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. Besides wedding dresses, he also designs long evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a navy-blue suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes, but with a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer and has no formal training in jewelry. She started designing jewelry when she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Many famous people now seek her jewelry. Her style includes large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she started using diamonds. At 36, she says, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**

Lily Grimson entered the competitive fashion world four years ago with only a basic art and design course. Two of her handbags were chosen for a major design exhibition. Her bags, made in the UK, are always noticed. They are glamorous, made from fine calfskin or heavy silk. A mix of style and care makes a Grimson bag special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He says most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His goal is to make sure clients don't look like they just left a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first visit, with a three-month waiting list. Peter also sells his own hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain. She also gives floral ideas to top restaurants. She has no formal training in floristry and left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her simple yet modern flower arrangements have won many design awards. She has started her own London Flower School and has given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She advises keeping flower arrangements simple and strong, with few leaves. For wedding bouquets, she says the flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four big old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is very happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can save guest preferences.

Guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little themselves, or the front desk can adjust it more. Business guests will like the technology in their rooms. MacCann thinks 65% of the hotel's business will come from business travelers. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing tool. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by adding extra cables. TVs are rented, so they can be updated easily. DVD players can also be upgraded when needed.

Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food must be excellent, as in all luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He got to design a new, modern kitchen and has better parking. The hotel benefits by having a popular restaurant without financial risk. With great technology and skilled staff, the Merrion is likely to do well."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. She gets many of her ideas from the big garden around her house. This garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The garden has a nice mix of colors, shapes, and structures, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan likes, and she also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny didn't agree with some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She says, ""I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then I add another one."" Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" She also enjoys watching how flowers change over time. For example, tulips change shape when you put them in water. At first, they look boring, but then they open up and look amazing.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then because she thought they looked fake, like the ones made of silk or plastic. She was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks. Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit well in her garden. She lets the garden grow naturally, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

Susan is busy with two upcoming exhibitions and has a lot of flowers to paint. She finds it hard to find time to work in the garden, so she hired another gardener. But she knows that to stay connected with her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the big storms in March. The town lost two important lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town center look different, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been upset too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forget things and become easily angry. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, he was getting his medicine from the pharmacy and going home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged, felt relieved when it wasn't, and went back to sleep. On Saturday, when the medicine started working and he felt better, he realized the walnut tree was gone and the living room looked different. The Pelhams' big house had a large garden, which made it feel private. Pelham didn't regret buying it, even though it was expensive. The garden used to have a beautiful walnut tree that made nice patterns of light and shade, hiding the old furniture they brought from their last house. Without the tree, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was now of the tall house next door, which was not nice to look at. It had ugly purple bricks and pipes, and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. 'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed happy. 'I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.'"
FCE_16,"Living in the Valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. These dangers could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys. They twisted and turned, moving east and up, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was slowly washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and getting close to a dangerous level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water rushed down to its lower parts. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded the nearby villages in a similar way. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only small overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams talks about his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I did some reviews for novels, films, and radio. That's how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. He also wrote for radio and TV. He hired me, but Tom wasn't mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his team. 

At first, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover art forms that didn't need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to review, and there would be guests to make it fun. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It felt like a millionaire wanted to help me personally and was pretending to hire me. I didn't have much confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to my review, I didn't know where to look.

Tom's idea for a team of critics never worked out. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so we did everything by phone. People preferred to link a reviewer with one subject, so I chose film. Without Tom's push, we wouldn't have the current setup, where I write a long weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn't like the usual film critic's job, which means reviewing every film that comes out. That would make me bored quickly. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning, thinking, 'What boring film must I watch now?' - a feeling common in screening rooms worldwide.

The space I have lets me expand my argument or, in a dull week, make something interesting. But what is my role in public? I think people choose films based on stars, publicity, or the director. People are loyal to certain types of films or the opposite. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romance fan to avoid a romantic film because of reviews. So if a film review isn't really a guide for choosing films, what is it? I don't feel I have to be 'right' about a movie. I don't think there should be a set number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. I just need to present an argument. I'm not a judge, and I don't want to be."
FCE_46,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because she thinks it's fun. A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner. The partner should be a sports enthusiast, preferably female, and interested in distance running, swimming, and cycling. The triathlon is becoming a very popular Olympic sport. Many people are amazed by athletes who swim, cycle, and run long distances without stopping. But why do these athletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a smart 17-year-old girl give up everything for this tough sport?

Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, hasn't learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that athletes often use. She says, ""You swim for 1500 meters, then jump on your bike while still wet. You get cold, and after cycling 40 kilometers, you have to run 10 kilometers. It's exhausting, but it's great fun and worth it in the end.""

Melanie did her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section, but she was the only junior competing. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. Even though she was fast in swimming and running, she didn't win because she got lost during the cycling part and went 20 kilometers too far. She cried during the run but didn't give up and is determined to keep going.

Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director, admires her determination. He says she worked so hard on a running machine that it threw her off. Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She is working hard to improve her cycling.

Her parents are supporting her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, which costs a lot. She also wants a new bike to compete in more races. Her intense training means she doesn't have much of a social life. She says, ""I'm not a party person. After hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I keep in touch with my teammates.""

Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" which is shorter. She wants to try even tougher events. She says, ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with."" It's interesting, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about her love for collecting things and why many people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults doing it. It is a world full of passion and excitement. But if you want to start collecting, remember: only collect things you truly love.

People have been collecting since ancient times. Early humans collected pebbles because they liked their shapes and colors. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for the same reasons.

I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. My parents took me to a local museum full of interesting objects, which fascinated me.

Many people share my interest in collecting. For some, it is the only part of their lives they can fully control. For me, it's just something I enjoy.

A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a tulip I wanted, but it was later stolen by another collector.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Sadly, this collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next day, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection, and I wasn't sure which loss was worse.

I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet becomes valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. Unfortunately, I threw away both the boxes and the toys."
FCE_3,"**My Job: Four People Talk About Their Work**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions at the Science Museum. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. First, I learn about the exhibition topic and talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I choose what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure everything is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents for students to learn the routes needed for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are at school, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When students are close to the test, I challenge them by asking for different routes, even if the road is closed, to make them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but mostly I am by the sea. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for people who manage the coast. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand marine life better. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. However, since I work for a charity, we always need more money, so I can't do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books we publish. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I talk about future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"Text: 'Our Holiday in Ireland We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made some changes, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We think it's quite a coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she's usually waiting in the big hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' These are the names of the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that, and her husband does the redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and then coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June, Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then come back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we developed this routine. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape.'"
FCE_67,"Title: Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year doing this job. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in chalets, which are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. 'It's a good way to meet successful people,' she says.

Sarah does not live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' After the guests finish breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is 'the worst part of the job.' By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She tries to ski as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.'

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting, but she does not nap. 'It's a bad idea if you do,' she says. Dinner, which has three courses, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and loads the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she chats with the guests, and other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks don't go as well.'

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We usually start at Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and maybe end at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. 'A terrible day,' she says, 'when you don't want to cook breakfast with a bad headache.' Work starts earlier on Sunday because breakfast for departing guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. 'We clean everything - clear breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. 'They arrive around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I'm sure it's the mountain air that affects them.'

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet from the ski shop staff. Soon, it's time for dinner again, and maybe a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,' she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie. However, she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by curly hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if he thought they were serious. Rita Cohen was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, these children visited the factory to see how gloves were made. Marie's favorite part was the laying-off table, where workers shaped and pressed each glove over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table. Marie called them the 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.

Rita asked Seymour, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She kept taking notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, ""They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour offered, ""You should visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but it's not very different from hundreds of years ago. It's hard work. Tanning is said to be the oldest industry, with remains found in Turkey from six thousand years ago. The first clothes were just skins tanned by smoking them. It's an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for two days. Glovemen love the trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" Rita replied, ""I can't say I have."" Seymour laughed when she said, ""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" He found her eager to learn and full of spirit. She reminded him of Marie, who was always full of what she learned in school. Seymour decided, ""I'll show you the whole process. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

**A. Raquel Graham**

Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But there's one small problem - she doesn't like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,"" she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork, like organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel plans. She didn't apply for the job. She met a pop group's manager by chance, which led to a job offer. She took a secretarial course at night school at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a PA.

**B. David Brown**

David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He liked being a caddy more because he loves golf. But there were some downsides. Caddies get a small fixed fee and a percentage of the golfer's winnings. They usually earn between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first worked for the golfer Greg Norman. ""You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the golf course."" His skills in accounting were noticed by European Tour Productions, and they made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies' scorecards. These results are wanted by TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers themselves.

**C. Martin Fern**

Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food at the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember forever than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director at an advertising agency, it was a good extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession."" He still cooks at home and tries to keep fit by cycling a few miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**

""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mostly wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story."" Where do his ideas come from? ""Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,"" he says. ""That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing out the morning's notes - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that's the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were made into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These piles looked like golden mountains and covered the yard down to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to jump too. Laughing, he watched them look down from the roof, scared, but then one by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes. Then one of the boys said, ""Let's go up on the roof again and jump down."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and started jumping off again until only Michael was left. The others were below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump and join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, nervous and smiling awkwardly, wondering why it seemed like a longer drop this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, and when that didn't work, he tried to take a deep breath and close his eyes. After a while, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll stay here all night?"" they shouted, and when he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating nervously. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. There were no sounds in the yard; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier, then got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home on time for dinner. If you won't come home, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, with his dark, sad face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the boys laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy with your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change jobs are now turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a short history about yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help advisers suggest new careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school exams. I was with about ten other people, answering questions quickly. It was important to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I talked with an adviser who gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, although I was a bit upset to learn I didn't do well in the scientific and technical tests. It's probably good that I never became a nurse! But I was happy to hear that journalism was a good choice for me.

Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager at an insurance company. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to think about my career and my skills,' says Donna. Some results surprised her. 'I didn't know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining in design,' she says. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my current skills and move to a job better suited for me than insurance. Now, I work as a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to friends who are also happy with the service.'

Some people feel they couldn't have made changes without help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and made big life decisions. 'After working at a bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I didn't know what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course this year. The advice was worth the cost. I'm much happier and more positive now.'

However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I didn't know where to go in my career. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many new ideas, I rejected them because they required a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that a friend could have given me similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"Title: 'A Fun Visit to the Dentist?'

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit for their check-ups. Jerome says, ""Half of the people only go to the dentist when they are in pain, not for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared."" To change this, he has made his office a place where people feel comfortable. He doesn't wear a white coat because he thinks it makes people think of pain. Jerome believes dental visits should be relaxing and even enjoyable.

This is surprising for many people who think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ideas is using virtual-reality headsets. His office was the first in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Jerome checks their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth. Many patients enjoy this part of their visit.

Another important thing is the smell in the office. It smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome says, ""When people come in, I want them to know it's not like a regular dentist's office. Smell is important. The usual dental smell can make people nervous."" I found the smell very nice.

Even though Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but good treatment is the most important. For example, he uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but it doesn't hurt if you are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. He learned that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for dentists. He thinks this patient-friendly approach will slowly change the traditional British dental profession.

Just then, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he wants to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it's easy to see why. The office feels more like a fancy beauty salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a big business around the world. At Easter, people in Britain spend over £230 million on chocolate. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought during this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. 

Large-scale chocolate production began in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a spelling mistake from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. The Aztecs flavored the drink with spices for ceremonies and to welcome visitors. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar as we know it started in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add some French style. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, first called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular with clever advertising that linked it to the healthy milk from the English countryside. 

Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. This has made chocolate makers find new ways to attract customers. One new idea is the 'extended line,' where a chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink, or a dessert to interest people who want something different.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. Many farmers, who work on a small scale, had to stop their businesses. Maybe you can think of them when you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke is 83 years old and has become very skilled in his art. He still wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he focuses on making beautiful and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the last ten years.

When showing his work, Peter says, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" He is not boring at all; he is very enthusiastic and charming. He shows me some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace and says, ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I love them. I never planned to sell my work. Some friends visited me five years ago and said, 'You should have an exhibition. People need to see these. We'll talk to an art gallery owner.'""

This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The pieces are expensive, around £2,000 for the ornaments, but Peter doesn't mind if his fireplace is empty. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he doesn't set the prices and is happy to talk about them. He believes no one else in the world makes work like his. The gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more.""

Peter wishes he had started this work earlier in life. He feels he could have made even more amazing things. Although he still has ideas, he finds it harder to work physically now. However, his work is much better than the usual shell items found in seaside shops. He creates tiny, detailed boxes, pictures, and realistic flower baskets from shells.

Peter has his own way of working. He uses materials he finds, like cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" but his work shows careful attention to detail and color.

To find beautiful and tiny shells, Peter has traveled to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming beaches. He says, ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them and breaking them faster than I can collect them. I would never take shells with living creatures in them. Once they are empty, why shouldn't I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially when you see the beauty of his work."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, you can find her studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm sorry, Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, that's fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I was trying to forget all the bad things I had read about models, like being difficult, vain, and not smart. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she thought going to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and said sorry for being late. She was with her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. She didn't seem selfish at all; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mum, very proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense because it was not planned. Her older sister decided she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should try it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When she got the call that she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she did great. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work right away.

Kira now finds it hard to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, some unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I think too much of myself."" This must be hard for Kira because she is not self-important. But she says, ""They think that because I've become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even finish their school exams. As I finish the interview with the girl who has it all, I ask what she would like to do if she didn't have the beauty that seems sure to make her successful. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son team who have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's hot climate to find valuable metals. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find a lot of gold; we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

The Maddens have spent their lives looking for gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They read old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing the land and finding small pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission to dig, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They have used their savings and need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it looks difficult, but we have some people we can ask.""

As news spread about their digging, people in the valleys became interested in the gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and locals are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would bring more people here if they are right, but if they find gold, I hope not too many people come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. Hall, who is 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, like finding hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves to explore the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, where she teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemical processes in the sea. When she is not teaching, she goes on dives to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to dive three kilometers down into the ocean. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can touch the two pilots next to her. They cannot stand up or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.

If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly goes to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it might not be a pleasant ride.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who showed her what to do in emergencies, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has done six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, are many underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was putting scientific equipment there to study the effects of a project that would make a hole 150 meters deep through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it so she can continue her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. The water comes out at one meter per second and is 350 degrees hot.

Rachel was only scared once, during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a big explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, but nothing happened. The relief was incredible—they were still alive!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is a big adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the window and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing things no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in real life was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind couldn't handle any more foreign timetables, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I needed was one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. The train's movement helps you sleep deeply. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply. You might even burn socks that smell too bad or throw away books when you're done with them. This way of thinking fits the Inter-Rail spirit, where you can forget about common sense and just enjoy the freedom. All you need is one of those tickets. This system lets young people travel through many countries quickly, which is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how great this train ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling all the time was too exciting. There was always another country to visit, just a bit further away. And it didn't cost us anything extra. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, like most other Inter-Railers, so we only saw the most obvious sights. We wanted to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that in many places, I only saw the view from the train station. We were there to enjoy ourselves. We were like most other Inter-Railers, sharing train floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. It's like the city didn't exist until the train arrived, and you saw it with your own eyes. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles can you really understand the continent. Everyone knows what's there, but it doesn't mean much until you see it yourself. That's why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip won't show you anything new in the world, it's a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to see this, though it didn't happen for us right away."
FCE_37,"There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your baggage is missing. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it is common for regular travelers to lose their luggage at some point. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes.

Here is how the system works. Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to go through the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between two flights, and these times are also longer to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, the system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights, which can cause the baggage system to fail. There is also the chance of human error or an accident where the destination label is torn off. These problems can be worse at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled more than 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with most moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage when changing planes is higher at some airports. Even in the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"Charlie James is a wildlife photographer who knows a lot about the kingfisher. The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. The area where it lives has old trees that hang over the water, creating a mix of soft green, brown, and yellow colors. The kingfisher flies quickly and directly, like a flash of light, and even though it disappears in a second, its image stays in your mind.

Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He can't explain exactly why he loves them so much, but they are part of many legends. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. Scientifically, kingfishers don't have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, their feathers reflect light in a way that makes them look blue or green, depending on the light.

Many wildlife photographers are excited about kingfishers because of their colors and because they can be watched easily from a hidden spot. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket he used to cover himself while waiting for a kingfisher. The bird came back quickly and sat very close to him. However, it took him four years to take a good picture. During this time, he spent as much time as possible near streams with many kingfishers, even skipping school, which affected his studies.

At 16, Charlie was noticed for his interest in kingfishers and was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant to the editor and then became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the best kingfisher film, with no talking, just beautiful images. He loves the simple approach and enjoys photographing parts of the kingfisher's wings. Even after spending so much time with kingfishers, he is still fascinated by them. His photos show some of his feelings, but he knows there is more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can show."

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, got a chance to work with famous conductor Claudio Abbado in Vienna when she filled in for an absent assistant. She wasn't nervous about leading her first rehearsal because she felt confident in front of an orchestra. Anne, who is from America, works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming well-known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has helped Abbado with several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after failing in two others. He believes the timing was perfect because if he had won earlier, he might not have succeeded. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition. He hopes that orchestras, like the English Chamber Orchestra, will continue to invite him back, or else his career might suffer.

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice sessions needed for opera productions. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional. Learning from conductor Sian Edwards was important for her because Edwards was the same size as her, which made a big difference. Wasfi likes the complexity of opera, including dealing with singers' personalities and disagreements.

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting to be a surprise but very interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's ""Agrippina"" from the piano at a festival, which was easier than he expected. He knew the music well and tried to achieve the performance he wanted. People respect his musical skills, and he learns from all his experiences. He is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys.

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, now 32, and recommended him to his agent. Marshall soon had to conduct a musical in London on short notice, which was challenging. He even dealt with musicians who were not paying attention during the show. He was firm with them and always gave clear instructions. Although he never formally studied conducting, he is confident and knows what he likes. People have been supportive, and he is determined to succeed."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you want to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try out some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns family**

Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. But we were surprised. The park is great for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay longer because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We spent six hours there and were happy to find places to rest. The park is beautifully designed, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with its exciting trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is great for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small for it, which was a relief for us! The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge family**

We arrived at 1 p.m. and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited 30 minutes for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the kids were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**

The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary, according to Ben. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were sometimes great with young kids, but not always friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't tell the kids we were leaving early!"
FCE_60,"Running a Business in the Countryside: Five Women Share Their Stories

A. Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Before she got married, she worked with computers, so her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. Christine was careful with spending and always informed the bank if she might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if she wants. The business is small, and local customers usually pick up their work.

B. Maggy Sasanow enjoys being independent. She designs greeting cards from home. Maggy studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no such jobs in the countryside where she moved after getting married. So, she started her own business, creating 50 different greeting cards that she sells to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. Her business grows through word of mouth, and she doesn't advertise. People send her work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Although she misses sharing ideas with others, she finds more advantages than disadvantages in her work.

C. Delia Turner has a curtain-making business that has had ups and downs. She started it eight years ago when this type of business was growing. Her earnings went from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years, and she managed six full-time workers. But she had to let them go because of the economy, which was hard since jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and hires women who work from their homes. Delia has to be ready to lower her prices when needed and look for new opportunities.

D. Tessa Strickland runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because London was too expensive and she loves the country. Tessa likes working when she wants, but 80% of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she has to take calls at odd hours. The challenge is to have the discipline to stop working. She publishes children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because all her professional experience was in London.

E. Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop, making £250,000 a year and employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, interested in health, making fruit cakes with good quality flour and eggs. Friends and family began asking for cakes, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made. She has a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg no longer cooks; she manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial part because they didn't have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons, Paul and Huw, are talented musicians and composers, and their father, John, makes musical instruments. 

When Paul was ten years old, he needed a cello because he was getting very good at playing. But cellos were very expensive. So, John decided to try making one himself. He found a school nearby that taught instrument making and took evening classes for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he made his first cello for Paul. It turned out well, and he made another one later, which Paul used for many years.

John enjoyed making instruments so much that he retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman. He now makes about twelve violins a year. One of his violins was even bought by a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.

Paul and Huw started playing music when they were very young. Paul first played the piano, but soon he wanted to play the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin, but he liked the cello player in his dad's music group and decided to learn the cello instead. Huw was also encouraged to play music, but he chose the piano and became a composer.

Paul became very successful with his father's cello. He won a big music competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. Now, he plays a very old and valuable cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. His father agrees that the new cello sounds very nice, but he believes his own cello will sound better as it gets older.

Paul will soon be on television playing the Rugeri cello in a famous piece, Elgar's Cello Concerto. However, he won't be able to watch it because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will be performed in London for the first time. Their parents, John and Hetty, will have to work hard to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules."

THE NATIONAL TRUST

The National Trust is a group that works to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. 

Gareth says a National Trust Warden needs common sense. He also says you need to be good with people because you work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. Gareth got the job because he knew the area well and had farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. 

Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. He says, ""They can't fool me about anything!"" His farming background also helps him with the physical work, like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. 

Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and wonders where they are now. He realizes that farming has changed the countryside, but it's not the farmers' fault. They were following government advice. 

When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists didn't agree. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth believes they are close to working together. 

Gareth's job includes conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He makes sure jobs are done well and cheaply. He enjoys seeing projects finished, though he spends a lot of time on paperwork. 

Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He likes talking to the public, but some people annoy him. They act like they own the place and demand things. Gareth says it's important to have common sense. If you have it and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But don't expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't people look at you strangely?"" She said, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra says, ""My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships. I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible."" This is her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have support from people at home, which is very special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Because we are playing here, there will be more pressure. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They have a lot of skill."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play every day, there's no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. ""You don't do all that training not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It's essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.""

""From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,"" she says. ""I decided some time ago that this competition would be the end of my playing career."" She will probably coach young players in the future, but right now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them grow their talent. Some parents might not notice their child's musical needs until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or science, but musically talented children need special support that regular schools might not offer, especially if music is not a main focus there. 

Children who are very good at music might benefit from going to a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools. These schools are for children aged seven to eighteen and help them improve their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music activities, like lessons on their instruments, playing in orchestras, singing, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours each day in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on important school subjects like English, math, science, and languages, but they can also study other subjects if they want.

All five music schools in Britain are private, and they have small classes with many teachers. Most students live at the school, which means they spend a lot of time with other children who have the same interests. 

There are some downsides to these schools. First, they are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for students who live there. However, schools try to help parents with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want their children to live away from home at a young age. School directors are careful about accepting very young children because the environment is intense and disciplined. They want to make sure students become well-rounded individuals.

Being in a special music school can be stressful. Some children might lose interest in music as they grow older, and the pressure to succeed can be hard. But these schools watch each student's progress closely and offer help if needed. Many students say they learned a lot from the music teaching, but some worry that the academic subjects are not given enough attention. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more in school. 

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves if they want to go to a specialist school. Children who are good at both music and academics might do well in a regular school with a strong music program or by taking music lessons at a music college on weekends. However, this might not be possible for families who live far from big cities like London."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her house has a big garden with many flowers she loves, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a nice mix of colors and shapes, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan likes, and she also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny didn't agree with some of Susan's ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She says, ""I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then I add another one."" Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" She also enjoys watching flowers change as they age. For example, tulips change shape and open up when you put them in water.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then because she thought they looked fake. She was amazed by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rocks or cliffs. Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit well in her garden. She lets the garden grow naturally, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

Susan is preparing for two exhibitions and has many flowers to paint, so she doesn't have much time to work in the garden. She hired another gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"Title: Keeping Holiday Guests Happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year doing this job. Sarah, also known as Pilch, cooks and cleans for people who come to ski and stay in chalets. Chalets are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it's a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. 'It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful people every week,' she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They get a full breakfast with porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After the guests finish breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she says is the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.'

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before starting. She does not take a nap because it makes her too tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans up and loads the dishwasher. 'I don't like coming to a messy kitchen in the morning,' she says. Sometimes she talks with the guests, and other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make the week great, but some weeks are not as good,' she says.

Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We usually start at Bananas, then maybe go to G Jay's, and end at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. But she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. 'It's a tough day,' she says, 'and you don't want to cook breakfast when you're tired.'

On Sunday, work starts earlier because breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet quickly. 'We clean everything, clear breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready.' If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. 'They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. I think it's the mountain air,' she says.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop. She gets a ride back to the chalet from the ski shop staff. Then it's time for dinner again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,' she says."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I usually clean cages or handle rats. I find magazines interesting, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in leather boots and dark blue trousers. They gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, I don't see daylight because of my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn't know landscape gardening was so hard and needed careful planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I would faint, but I was okay. The nurses' friendship is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't pleasant, but it was satisfying.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different—people respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was surprised at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this, but it inspired me to join a gym and be healthier."""

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses into Italy. It passes by some of the most beautiful sea views. It doesn't matter what the weather is like or what time of year it is; it is always charming. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the amazing journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have enjoyed many train journeys over the years, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which goes across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its big glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how nice it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding preparations.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable - we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train appeared, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriages - some even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite train memories from when they are children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had taken care of. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could, and when I went back last year, it was like time had stopped. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

No matter what you write, you need to understand the markets you are targeting. The best way to do this is by reading a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely helps you see what publishers are accepting. Remember, this knowledge needs updating because new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. 

If you are unsure what to write, start by exploring. For example, if you want to write short love stories, find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and learn what kind of stories they buy and who their readers are. Editors focus on what their readers want. Writers often ask me, 'My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?' As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But often, the work is not ready to be published. Most new writers send their work too soon, before they are ready. If you have only written one story or article, it is unlikely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. 

When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while waiting for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more. Each story will be better, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. Your skills and confidence will grow. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I also suggest not showing your work to others, especially at the beginning. Remember, every successful writer faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby or join a local writers' group. This will help you gain ideas and confidence from other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"
FCE_4,"On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. The station was busier than usual. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. A well-dressed, grey-haired man was talking to different people. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. Then he asked a girl near me the same question. She said she was going to New York, not Philadelphia. The man thanked her and moved on.

I was curious about him. He asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to Wilmington. He didn't say anything and continued to another couple. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me. Maybe I didn't look reliable to him. He seemed stressed and asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes. He asked her for a favor.

I pretended to check my watch, even though I didn't have one. The woman seemed cautious. The man explained that his daughter was flying abroad from Philadelphia and had forgotten her passport. She called home from the station, unsure of what to do. He told her to stay there, and he would find someone to bring her passport.

The woman listened sympathetically. I wondered why he didn't go himself. He said he couldn't leave his wife alone because she was in a wheelchair. This seemed like a weak excuse to me. I noticed he was holding a padded envelope, not a regular one. It was stapled shut, which made me suspicious. I silently warned the woman to be careful."
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, a restaurant owner, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef.

I think everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was just what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory, and I was upset because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife took care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This was very good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.

Gary was a very active child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into our corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs, and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had a lot of money at school. He was disciplined. He used to wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was excellent in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He would make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he had a talent for it. So when he told me, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for my school course,' I sent him to a friend who has a restaurant.

Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can do well. I told him, 'Gary, if you want to achieve something in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it might be too late.'

Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He had prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping other people. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one gives you anything for free. He saw the opportunity he was given and took it with both hands. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even ten percent of what you tell them, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding a good apartment in Dublin that you could afford was very difficult, like finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a place, that often helped. But if you were new to Dublin, like Jo, you had no personal contacts and no one to tell you about available rooms. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and search for a place. For her, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going; everyone at her school assumed she would leave their small town. Who would want to stay in a boring, remote place? That's what she heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, see the world, and have a real life. Some of her classmates went to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family would help them settle. But Jo was the only one from her year going to Dublin, and she was going alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed in the hostel permanently because it was run by nuns, and she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The ""own television"" part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who seemed to have been rejected, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" ""Oh,"" said Jo and continued up the stairs.

""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" ""What did she do?"" asked Jo. ""Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh voice. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Jo noticed she was a punk, which surprised her. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but never talked to one. ""I'm Jo, I work at the post office, and I called about the flat."" Nessa said they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs. One said ""Nessa,"" one said ""Pauline,"" and the other said ""Other."" ""We'll put your name on it if you stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"Text: 'Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We like to see them in seaside marinas, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in big trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are disappearing. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down by up to 89,000. You might think dolphins are protected by law and live in safe areas. But this is not true, and not helping them could be a big wildlife problem. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out in the sea and are seen only in small groups. We do not know much about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only in Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few left have skin injuries, showing they are stressed. Dolphins have complex habits, making it hard to know why their numbers are going down. Overfishing is a big problem. It reduces fish stocks and threatens dolphins because they need to find food quickly. If fish are gone from one area, dolphins may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses big nets that float or move fast in the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornwall beaches, showing they died from getting caught in nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them. These poisons can pass to their young through milk. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Another big problem for dolphins is human noise. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This noise might disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet know.'"
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels busy and stressful. You might think, ""Oh no, another article about exercise!"" But there are many good reasons to exercise, and not many reasons not to.

Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit with good posture, which is how you hold your body. Good posture prevents muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored. But did you know exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems? It also helps control stress and can improve some medical conditions. These are good reasons to start exercising.

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. Be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is important for how you look and feel. A stiff or slouching body can look unattractive and feel tired. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This helps you stand taller and breathe better. It also makes your body look slimmer.

Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period. Doing this four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit."
FCE_11,"**In Their Natural Habitat**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, Amanda Barrett, a producer, and Owen Newman, a cameraman, are hard to find. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained almost non-stop for six months, causing many problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive tool to help when their vehicles get stuck in the mud. Amanda can then pull him back to safety. Together, they have made some of TV's best wildlife films, like their popular film about leopards. Even while this film was being shown, they were already back in the wild, this time following the shy jackal.

This is common for TV partnerships. Film-makers have traveled the world to film exotic wildlife since TV began. I talked to Newman about their partnership when he was at a safari lodge. 'We sometimes argue, but we get over it quickly,' he says about Amanda. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader. They get along well because they both see animals in the same way. 'When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now we have a fixed camp, and we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask.' Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a problem,' says Newman. It can be tough, but being alone in remote areas lets them get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a lion family where a lioness would greet their car as part of her routine.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift.' Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. They spend four months on location to get enough material for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I have a good working relationship because we share the same ideas and vision,' says Newman. 'We want to make films that are rich in atmosphere, show the true spirit of the place and animals, and touch people's hearts. If you can make people feel something, it's better than just making them think.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain. Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'

'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 'I'm on a strict schedule to get as fit as possible.' These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries taking part. 'We'll have support from people at home, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start with a good game.'

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They have a lot of skill.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready.'

In the fifteen years since she started playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But once the game is over, we are all friendlier.' Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. I support and encourage the team.'

'From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player.' She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, where she teaches and studies marine geochemistry, which is about the chemical processes in the sea. When she is not teaching, she goes on dives to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to dive three kilometers down into the ocean.

Inside the vehicle, space is very tight. Rachel can touch the two pilots sitting next to her. They cannot stand up or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.

If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has used it yet, and Rachel thinks it would not be a pleasant trip.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, like what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would handle being in such a small space. Now, Rachel has done six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a place five days' sail from the Canary Islands. There, they studied a large area of underwater volcanoes. The Russian team was setting up equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it so she can continue her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes that release water that looks like black smoke. The water comes out at one meter per second and is 350 degrees hot.

Rachel was only scared once, during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a loud explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. But nothing happened, and they were relieved to be safe.

Diving to the deepest parts of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she sees the underwater volcanoes, she feels amazed. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing things no one else has seen before. After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in real life was an incredible experience for her."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people decide what they think about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, and our voice's volume and tone, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. One of her friends, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best."" Many people forget how important it is to have a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't even get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job right away. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to say no. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have got more if I had controlled my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it will help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before you go for an interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confused sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he has a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years, but it became boring and not fun anymore. He didn't plan to leave his job for another five or ten years, but he lost his job unexpectedly. He didn't get a lot of money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. His big opportunity came when he met the head chef of a local hotel with a top restaurant. By supplying them, his reputation grew, and now he also sells meat by mail order. He is happy not to be in an office anymore, but he still works 80 to 90 hours a week and sells a product.

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. Painting started as a hobby, but he found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him, and he was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. Ron and his wife married young, and their children didn't need their support. They moved to the north of England, where they didn't know anyone. They left their friends, but their friendships survived, and many friends visit them now.

**The Hat Maker**

Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own business making hats in her London flat. She enjoyed her job as a lawyer and earned a lot of money, but the hours were long. She didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so she left. People said she would get bored, but she never did. The secret is to have deadlines because it's a fashion business with collections and seasons. She feels happier and less stressed now. She misses socializing with colleagues but loves being responsible for her product. If she does a bad job, she takes the blame.

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in financial markets at 22, making deals. He liked the excitement but didn't find the work rewarding. In 1989, he almost lost his job, so he resigned and traveled for a year. During that year, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. He knew he needed qualifications to change careers, so he took massage courses. He got a part-time job at the Life Centre and has no regrets. Now he feels in control and has peace of mind."
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I tried many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My biggest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you can't party late at night. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. It's worth it, though, because without dedication, I wouldn't have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a TV show about surfing. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in style, but we don't look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends who aren't in sailing. You can't focus on the sport all the time; it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I'm rarely recognized on the street, which I like. I get letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on the court. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out, but it can be difficult. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports and be professional. I'm okay with focusing on my game now and enjoying other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Shopping with Children**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the newest sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, it's all three. I can't buy all this stuff, and if I do, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a shopping trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things. Arguments about sugar being bad for teeth don't work well against fun and emotional ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' that's still what they want.""

Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son listens to ads but is critical of them. They look at labels together, and now her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy.

Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm in a good mood, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury with modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four big old houses into this hotel. This way, they could add the newest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is very happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can note down guest preferences.

Guests often complain about room temperature in hotels. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can change the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Also, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C. 

Guests, especially business travelers, will like the technology in their rooms. MacCann thinks 65% of the hotel's business will come from business travelers. To meet their needs, each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing tool. Technology changes fast, so the hotel has prepared for future updates. Extra cables are ready for new technology. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be replaced with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed.

Even with all this technology, MacCann says they have tried to make the rooms feel comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food must be excellent, as in all luxury hotels. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He got to design a new, modern kitchen and has better parking than before. The hotel benefits by having a popular restaurant without financial risks. With technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is likely to do well."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share how they stay energetic.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I get energy from excitement. I need to do things that challenge me. Learning new things gives me a lot of energy. I also get energy from rhythm, like when I learn flamenco dancing. Dance is great because it's expressive and gives you energy. If you're bored, you might feel tired and think life has no purpose. Doing something useful, even if it's small, gives you energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a chore. If you like what you do, you won't feel down, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep, and when I get it, I feel great. If I only sleep six hours a night, I feel tired. Exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to start. I do yoga once a week before work and try to exercise at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily for energy; I think it's my natural enthusiasm and being positive. I don't like negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and live in the moment. Enjoyment is important. You need to set goals and achieve them. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many young people, and their energy affects me. I love being busy and social. I enjoy taking photos, but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I can't wait to see them after they're developed. I've also started writing lyrics for fun, which helps me relax when I travel.""

**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do at work and with my family. Being positive helps. I love working with kids because they have a lot of energy and are strong. Energy is like a natural chemical that comes from talking to others. Try smiling at people and see how good it feels when they smile back. It's better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise plan. I get my exercise by playing with kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
""I love making a garden from a wasteland. I did that once with a garden that was all concrete. I broke the concrete and added soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. I also get energy from knowing people want to read what I write. I find it hard to write if no one is interested. I like exploring places like a farmer's land or a wood. If someone finds me, I say, 'Oh, what a nice place, I didn't know it was private.' I like it because it feels like being a child.""

**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**  
""I think you need to be interested in and respect what you do. I like taking risks and get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do makes you tired. I used to be on different committees and didn't like how they took my time. You only have so much energy, so use it for things that matter to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. People have found old skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until about 200 AD when iron skates came to Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was calm and stylish. But in the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie made skating more athletic, which made it more popular. Today, skating mixes art and sport, making it both beautiful and challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to stay balanced. Your body should lean a little forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It's quite easy, right? As you practice, you can make your movements longer.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for skaters. Even the best skaters fall. To avoid getting hurt, try to stay relaxed when you fall. This helps reduce the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up. Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. It's best to start with figure skating and then learn basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basics, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, you should do regular exercises. It's dangerous to skate with a stiff body, so warm-up exercises are important. Focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also makes your heart and lungs stronger and generally strengthens your body. If you combine skating with swimming or jogging, you can have a great fitness program for overall health."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can make you cry with happiness. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the good and bad parts of their lives.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15**

Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard now. I don't have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gym and school. I try to take each training day as it comes. When I'm very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

**B. Annika's Mother**

""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, and it doesn't work. To perform like Annika, you have to want it yourself. People say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was shy and hid behind me, but now she's met people worldwide and gained confidence.""

**C. Sarah Stokes**

Sarah started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me to events. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined. I'm happy they are proud when I win, but I do it for myself. My goal this year is to join the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

**D. Sarah's Mother**

""Sarah loved horses from age 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, you have to travel all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happiest on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10**

Jane is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about being too proud. I don't talk about my success at school because I don't like feeling embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's Mother**

""Jane played her first chess game at 5. My father said, 'Let's see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to hold her back because she's special. If she has this talent, let her reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"Chris Greener was 14 years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?"" because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, Chris is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every ten years, people in Europe get about one centimeter taller on average. More and more tall people are being born. This doesn't mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are now losing the effects of many years of poor diet, which is changing us a lot. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

In the past, our ancestors ate a wide variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. About 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers took over green areas, and now three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—give us more than half of our calories. This poor diet has hurt our health and bodies. Over time, we ate soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought to be a blessing, was actually bad for health.

Farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. But most people were poorly nourished. Only recently have richer countries started to improve diets. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are now more like our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, as they have been since 1860. Leg-room in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products.

The question is: how tall will we get? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might shrink even more. So, global warming could stop us from growing taller."
FCE_57,"Text: 'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of TV life, but they are still a mystery to many of us. When we see them getting excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Among all live entertainment audiences, studio audiences are often seen as the least important. Some people in TV even look down on them, treating them 'like cattle,' as one cameraman said. I thought studio audiences were just people wanting a bit of fame. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. TV tries to get different people for different shows. Those of us who like watching TV at home don't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. Why did she come? It was a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was 'a friend gave me a ticket.' Few of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit there, crowded with strangers, while someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH - and you clap or laugh when told. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager says, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting,' while Charlotte liked feeling part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you see him on TV at home, you miss a lot.' What I missed was seeing live actors - from where I sat, I could only see the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching the show on a studio screen. Going to a studio might be a bad way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment.'"
FCE_9,"**Bruce**  
I don't like wild landscapes without people. I like places with a human touch. When I travel, I prefer lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape school. I loved exploring the hilltops, valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, the landscape felt familiar but different. I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by hobbyists. I always travel first class because it doesn't cost much more. The scenery isn't spectacular. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But I always look forward to one part of the journey when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we can see people doing everyday things like making tea or doing the dishes. I see myself as a woman in a tiny train, looking into other people's homes. I like the ordinary landscape. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer to find something special.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea's beauty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland through valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering places with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many people living or visiting there. It's a hidden, empty, and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found the area by chance when I was a student, and since then, I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted pure peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys being around them. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she found a great pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals we found, so we could admire them and read about them in our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, a white mouse I got as a Mother's Day gift. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room, trying to find a way out. I tried to help but tripped and fell on the floor. As I thought about how to stop Domino, I saw the snake escaping from its tank.

The room was chaotic with the cat, mouse, kids, and now the snake. The dog was barking too. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and came back to the room. I managed to catch Domino by the tail and saved the mouse, which was wet but unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life.

Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I looked at the snake to see how to catch it. It was not easy. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed, and I carefully picked it up. I took it to the end of the garden and pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would go there. But when I let go of its head, the snake wrapped around my shoulders like a scarf, seeming to settle in for the winter.

We stood there, me, my four children, and the snake. My eldest, DJ, said, ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and fat and warm, and the shed isn't."" We gently encouraged the snake to move on. Slowly, it climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Send me a letter! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old way of writing letters might disappear. But for me, getting a letter is special and different from other ways of communication. There is the excitement when it arrives, the happiness of seeing who sent it, and the joy of reading it. I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the small notes I wrote to my mother. My mother always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote once a week, and so did my mother. Sometimes my father wrote, and it was always fun to get his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday things happening with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I often had boyfriends who had to work or study far away, and we could only stay in touch by writing letters. But instead of hurting the relationships, writing letters made them better. I found that I could often say things more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a friendship through letters could last so long. The local newspaper even thought it was important enough to put on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art in the Alps**

In the French Alps, there are tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into rocks at Mont Bego. These pictures are very old, about 4,000 years, and show cows with horns, fields, and gods and goddesses. Scientists are worried because these drawings are being damaged quickly by careless tourists. They fear that if this continues, the drawings might not be there for future generations.

The site is popular, and many visitors are ruining the pictures with graffiti. Jean Clottes, who leads the International Committee on Rock Art, says people think the pictures will last forever, but they won't if the damage continues. He has seen tourists walking on the drawings, which wears them away. Some even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. When tourists can't take good photos, they rub the drawings to make them clearer, which damages them more.

Some people even scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts are not sure how to best protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the mountain should be closed to the public, except for guided tours. He believes this is the only way to save the site and continue important research.

However, Jean Clottes disagrees. He thinks closing the site completely would upset local people. The site is a historic monument, and he believes they should try to save it without closing it. David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says the area is too big to stop all damage, and they don't have enough money to hire guards. They might need to charge visitors a fee because there is no government funding.

Annie Echassoux, who also studies the site, is worried because tourists can now reach the mountain more easily by hiring vehicles. She thinks the damage will get worse. She believes they should rope off the area and provide guides. She insists that money must be found to protect the site because it is a historic area. If they don't act, the drawings might be lost for future generations."
FCE_32,"**Shopping with Children**

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the newest sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, it's all three. I can't buy all this stuff, and if I do, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""

Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a shopping trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things. Arguments about sugar being bad for teeth don't work well against fun and emotional ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' the effect is the same.""

Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son listens to ads but is critical of them. They look at labels together, and now her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy.

Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm in a good mood, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,"Text: 'Climbing Walls In the past, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can have a challenging climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. People watch closely as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by his fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, and both events have something in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they either climbed in cold weather, walked, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for top climbers to stay fit. When cliffs were not usable, they used brick or stone buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom. Soon, sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges. One of the first was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He put natural rock in concrete blocks for climbing walls. Many walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had problems. They could only be built straight up, while real cliffs have overhangs and angled rocks. Also, once built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the same holds. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a material that could be shaped like real cliff features. These could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls, but steel frames could be set up anywhere. This system allowed climbers to have new holds all the time.'"
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky' very quickly. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are more people who want to be actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you are crazy, but others might think differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But becoming an actor is a personal choice, and only you can decide and work towards your dream. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even if you finish your training, it does not mean you will get a job. Success depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous, with the chance of earning a lot sometimes. People often ask what talent is. I think talent is natural skill plus imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. Talent also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain why you want to act. In the theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is important in all acting and is what motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might just shrug. They might not know. They know some things about themselves and their skills, but they do not assume anything because they know their success depends on their current job. Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs like selling clothes or waitressing. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role, but you might not get it, even if you want it very much. So, actors do not talk much about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and possible rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, rejection can happen from the first time you try to get a role. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

This is a good trend, but it has problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, as they have been since 1860. Leg-room in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products.

The question is: how tall can we get? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might shrink even more. So, global warming could stop us from growing taller."

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he has a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years, but it became boring and not fun anymore. He didn't plan to leave his job for another five or ten years, but he lost his job unexpectedly. He didn't get much money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. His big chance came when he met the head chef of a local hotel with a top restaurant. By supplying them, his reputation grew, and now he also sells meat by mail order. He is happy not to be in an office anymore, but he still works 80 to 90 hours a week and sells a product.

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. Painting started as a hobby, but he found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him, and he was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. Ron and his family moved to the north of England, where they didn't know anyone. They left their friends, but their friendships have lasted, and many friends visit them now.

**The Hat Maker**

Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own business making hats in her London flat. She enjoyed her job as a lawyer and earned a lot of money, but the hours were long. She didn't want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so she left. People thought she would get bored, but she never did. She keeps busy with deadlines and fashion collections. She feels happier and less stressed now. She misses socializing with colleagues but loves being responsible for her product. If she does a bad job, it's her responsibility.

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in financial markets at 22, making deals. He liked the excitement but didn't find the work rewarding. In 1989, he almost lost his job, so he resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. He knew he needed qualifications to change careers, so he took massage courses. He got a part-time job at the Life Centre and has no regrets. He feels in control and has peace of mind now."
FCE_5,"**Onto a Winner**

Two brothers are turning their childhood game into a successful business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with big beards, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are playing a game from their childhood called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, who was a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. The family loved playing it on weekends and holidays. When they moved to New Mexico, they continued to play with the board their grandfather made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often curious because the game was not known in the southern USA.

Three years ago, Dave noticed the old board was damaged, so he made a new one. It was so nice that a relative and then a friend wanted one too. To see if more people were interested, the brothers took the new board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people laughed at the game, but once they tried it, they couldn't stop playing. When people asked about the game's history, Dave found out it probably started in India with a game called 'carroms'. It then became 'squails' in Britain and was brought to Canada by British immigrants. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version from Quebec.

Pichenotte is a game of skill for two to four players. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' to flick across a board using one finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole scores 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight small posts make the game harder. A game usually lasts two minutes.

Seeing how popular the game was, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. The game became so popular that championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As more people heard about it, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope their business will grow. Until then, they enjoy playing the game that might make them rich."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first come to the Model Village, it's hard to believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land covered with wild plants. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with the help of his wife, worked hard to turn it into the beautiful place you see today. They moved a lot of soil and clay to change the flat land into the nice landscape you see now. Machines helped, but there was also a lot of hard work involved. After shaping the land, they added about 1,000 tonnes of good soil to make the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.

Many trees and bushes were planted in the Model Village. They had to choose plants that could survive the salty air from the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some came from far places like Canada and New Zealand.

Colin Sims created the whole village, and he made over 100 models by himself over nine years. The village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to last in all weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how materials would last in different weather, but soon he became an expert too.

You will see that the models are all made to the same scale, and even the smallest details are carefully done. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular because of its high quality and care. The techniques used here are now used in other model villages in England and are even taught in some schools.

All the model buildings show traditional British architecture but are not exact copies of real places. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, which looks like a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It is based on the style of manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest part of the village.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small mistake can mean hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. 

To make your visit more fun, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press them to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village more interesting. We also want to know if you think any models need improvement. We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!"
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC is an organization that deals with these issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before. Since she was in a hotel, where she should expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It is surprising that the PCC did not investigate this. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair stories? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. These decisions would be reported by other newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would not be worth their time to hide and take pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC watch over all British newspapers: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. They might have a worse story they want to keep secret, and they know it might come out if they complain. In this way, even the PCC might seem like the enemy. A British comedian also had problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, or later, when his family was photographed on holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper, News of the World, would show the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

We are not talking about people looking for another temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those leaving a bad job after a few weeks. We are focusing on those who are ready to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and have an idea of what you want to do. What kind of job should you look for next? It depends on your long-term goals. Do you want to specialize in a certain area, move up to a higher position, or change to a different field? Whatever you choose, pick your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next one. It should show that you are serious about your career. It should also help you grow and give you more responsibility. If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see you have traveled and are ready to focus on your career. 

Juliette Davidson worked for three lawyers after leaving St. Aldate's College. It was a great first job because the people were supportive. She learned about office work and improved her computer skills. But there was no chance to move up. So, she quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Now, Juliette is a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, 'In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has grown.' Her boss wanted to help her develop from the start. Her job title is the same, but her duties have changed.

FCE_17,"Confident people: What's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but most of them learned how to be confident because they needed to. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

A. Jenny: When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I did well. Someone there suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school changed my life and helped everything else fall into place.

B. Michaela: Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive and impatient. I thought confident people acted like that, but I learned that confidence means believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel bad about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lose confidence, so I talk to myself to get rid of those fears.

C. Lisa: People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. I had to learn to look confident because it's important in TV. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and we feel better when we talk to someone friendly. My mom gave me the best advice when I was worried about wearing the right clothes. She said, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves.' I remember that. You gain confidence by doing things that scare you. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I would never be that scared again.

D. Barbara: My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over the years. If you keep going and learn from mistakes, you become more confident. I work hard and am liked in the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped my confidence. They also encourage setting small goals. It helps to see you're achieving something real, instead of trying to do too much at once and getting nothing.

E. Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and didn't always agree in meetings but was too scared to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself, 'Don't be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.' I also found it helpful to write down a few notes, like having a comfort blanket. Everyone feels a bit nervous about public speaking. The real secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"Text: 'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his broken kite. 'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest and most serious kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a line of nervous competitors held their kite strings, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and how well they fly. 'Flying kites isn't very hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, shiny room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving my car towards Kuala Lumpur, into mountains covered with thick rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A long, narrow boat was there to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a path into the forest and said: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' Before starting, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the path, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who took care of a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. The night was completely dark, full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many living things moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was an amazing view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning hit the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the path. No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were very friendly. Kelantan might be best known for its kites, but I remember it more for its human kindness.'"
FCE_48,"**What kind of shopper are you?**

Everyone goes shopping, even if they love it or hate it. But people shop in different ways. Do you know what kind of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people about their shopping habits.

**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**  
I love shopping! I can't stop spending money. When I have money, I go shopping, and it makes me happy. I find it hard to ignore sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We are a shopping couple!

**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**  
I don't like shopping much. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he wants. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all like different things. I don't often spend money on myself, so when I do, I feel guilty and don't tell my husband the real price. I always say it cost less because the real price sounds too high.

**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**  
I only shop for things I really need. I don't like shopping and only go when I must. When I shop, I know exactly what I want and won't buy anything else. I find shopping tiring and would rather do something else.

**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**  
I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and shop quickly. I do have some clothes I bought by mistake, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes makes wrong choices.

**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**  
I don't like shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can't find what I want, and nobody helps me. The shops are too noisy and messy, and I find it very stressful. Luckily, I don't have to shop for clothes often because most of my clothes are gifts. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish it quickly.

**F. Lisa, 22, actress**  
I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my friends to look around the shops, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I'll buy it.

**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**  
I'm a careful shopper. I like shopping, but I don't buy a lot. I usually know what I want and don't go crazy. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but I often feel worse because I spent too much money.

**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**  
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it's too busy. I'm a careful shopper. I usually know what I want and don't buy things quickly. I like to check other shops to find a better deal, so I take a long time.

**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
I'm an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city center, the shops don't interest me anymore. When I have to shop, I do it quickly and don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Sometimes the clothes I buy don't fit, but I don't mind. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of time shopping."

Children will look at 14 surprising paintings and answer questions about them. The quiz sheets are available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**

The Gallery has a new still life painting by Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778 because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons to paint them. Miss Violet Churchman gave this picture to the Gallery in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. You can see it in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu. The exhibition also includes Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition is open until 31 May.

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to make. 

Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, people like Mr Green, who was a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many years, she was the only woman scientist mentioned in history books. Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he made sure she got the best education possible. This was unusual because most women at that time did not have many chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia went back to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have any copies of her books, but we know she wrote several important works in mathematics. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented some scientific tools to help with her work. At that time, many rulers were afraid of science, and people connected with it were in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.'"

PET_27,"Grass

Grass is probably the most successful plant in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grass, and they are found everywhere on Earth. Grass is the only flowering plant that can live in the cold places like the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so there is always food."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai has always loved fashion and recently won the Young Achiever of the Year award at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After finishing her studies, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to industry events but couldn't afford the expensive clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends loved her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her designs, and they sold very well. This success gave her the confidence to leave her job, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own women's clothing brand. Kal's parents were not upset about her career change and promised to support her, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates clothes for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels very lucky and says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,"**SUNNINGDALE HOTEL**

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has given great service to people from all over the world. Over the past 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed here.

The hotel is on a main road that leads to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes by bus to get to the center, and buses to many parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Be careful not to take buses with the blue sign ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is an underground station less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 comfortable single rooms with central heating. Each room has a basin with hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the corridors. The hotel also has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. Guests can use eight pianos. There is parking available in the hotel drive. Free daily newspapers are provided, and you can buy stamps at the office.

Guests staying for a long time must pay weekly in advance and give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get room priority. Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. On weekdays, if you are studying or working late, you can request dinner until 11 pm by writing your name on the late list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires (for heating food or rooms) are allowed. Please respect others' comfort. Keep noise from tapes or CDs low, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If you arrive by train, it is best to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main railway station."

Bo the cat had a big adventure when she decided to explore a furniture van. The van driver found her after driving more than 500 kilometers. It was a long day, and both the driver and Bo were hungry. The driver gave Bo some milk and started looking for her owner. He called his last customers, but none of them had lost a cat. Since it was late, he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital.

PET_49,"Text: 'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north coast through a lot of desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is mostly known for being late. The idea of a train line between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but there was often flooding, making it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train - there are few stops and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is very good. The railway was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's busy south through Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. It is not every day a railway across a continent is finished, and the Ghan says it is the world's first north-south one. As I waited to get on the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the trip. Most of the other travelers were older Australians, and they were very eager to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have given everything the ads promise, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.'"
PET_31,"Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is 600 meters high and is probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is so hard it feels like ice. Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment. We had lights to get attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path soon went up, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but when I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that next time I would train better before a climb. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we were not so lucky because a mist came down. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as climbing up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was happy we took turns doing that job. That first time, I only really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we moved into our new school building! It's a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. But this new school is special because it is designed to be very good for the environment. It took many months to build, so we watched it being built. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but it also meant we lost some nice open space. The building machines were very noisy, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are very big - much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town when they need to have meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We are excited to use them when our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice there are no heaters! The heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside, and it keeps the sound inside too. So, when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that there is a tree on the school roof! The builders put it there because it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that you can see it from far away! We took some pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, there are still some parts to be added. For example, we are putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda.

A young man asked me what was wrong, and I explained what had happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, with everything still inside.

PET_60,"Text: 'Sharks Sharks are some of the scariest animals in the ocean. They are very good at finding food because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if you turn a shark over on its back, it can stop moving completely. This is helpful for scientists who study sharks because it lets them learn more about these interesting animals.'"

At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone came to me, asking questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they started talking in English, so we could understand each other. Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once because I felt a little lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are very hard, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This makes me confident that I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold.

PET_55,"THE ICEHOTEL

For many years, people liked to visit the Arctic in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. But in winter, only a few people lived there, and they had the snow and ice all to themselves. By the end of the 1980s, people thought the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an art show in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, brought many visitors to the area. One night, some foreign guests thought it would be fun to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and this gave the idea for an ice hotel. Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from different countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As soon as one part is ready, it opens to visitors and guests who want to stay overnight, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is finished. The ICEHOTEL is built outside, using natural winter materials, so the finishing date can change because of the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it is colder outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the price of staying at the hotel. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, a scarf, and lots of wool socks. They should choose shoes that are bigger than normal to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these things when you book your visit, and they will be in your room when you arrive.

The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

Normally, the shop will be open from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours on the first day. However, it had to close just 30 minutes after opening. A police officer who went to the shop said: 'The police knew a big crowd was coming, but people were not patient. The shop filled up quickly, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in, and they didn't want to wait quietly. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to reach the car park. I couldn't believe that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road completely.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained the situation. They had no choice because it wasn't safe. I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters deep and return without help, holding her breath for over three and a half minutes. This made her the only woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive to ensure her safety. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya believes safety and training are most important.

Tanya's training is mostly on land, with two-thirds of her time spent in the gym. She uses an exercise bike to keep her heart fit but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking. When she practices diving, she usually travels and does fourteen dives over four weeks, resting between each dive to avoid getting tired.

When not training, Tanya appears in public to promote sports products and supports environmental causes by doing research or making films. Growing up on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean, she loved swimming and exploring sea life. She feels her life now is like living her childhood dreams.

Cartoon films can do almost anything. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the movie screen. With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming fun again for everyone, no matter their age. By the end of the 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for children. But soon, a few directors had new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy together. However, not every cartoon film was a hit. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again."

Caroline Benson, a new TV star, shares her experience about her first TV role. She says, ""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays before, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother always said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I dreamed of playing her. 

Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part.

I didn't tell my university friends about the filming, but they found out and thought it was amazing. It was a fantastic experience, and I feel very lucky. 

After university, I want to become an actress. I don't come from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles but haven't received any offers yet.

PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to 75,000 kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than 300 types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. Honey was very valuable to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as money. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that it can help prevent tiredness and improve sports performance. But honey is not just food - it can be used for sore throats and is in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. People have lived there for more than two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By 1066, during the Norman invasion, it had become one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it received a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It grew richer over the next 300 years and was known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has a growing student population and is a modern commercial center. It is the biggest center for insurance services outside London. Norwich offers many entertainment options, such as theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries,' with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

Norwich has a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall.' To build it, workers dug up the main car park, creating a large hole in the city for over two years. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to make the roof of the Mall a city center park with water pools and trees. The people of Norwich are happy that the old open market is still there, next to the new development. Both the market and the shopping center are successful, showing that Norwich has combined the old and the new well."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, becomes full of bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, there were only about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from more than a third of the countries in the world are expected at the festival's current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The balloon pilots talk to each other using radios and light up their balloons' burners at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow' and is a great chance to take amazing photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after it gets dark or before 5:30 am when the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to take off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, and some are shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can even take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies offering flights. Another option is to take a cable car ride from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere and gives you a great view of the festival from above. There are many other things to do for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a special wind pattern in the area that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long lines at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, bring your camera. If you are not using a digital camera, you will need high-speed film for taking pictures in the evening and at night."
PET_51,"The Eden Project

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular places for tourists to visit. At first, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is amazing to see how many products we use every day come from plants, like wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants grow here. Even if the weather is cold outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always damp because of a big waterfall. Another zone copies the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to build a desert zone soon."
PET_11,"Text: 'No Title Some people have complained about this year's book, New Writing 3, but I don't understand why. It has 500 pages of original writing for only £6.99, which is great! Most of the book is fiction, with parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable pieces by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, the less famous writers mostly wrote about food. Be careful with Jane Harris's Those Nails - don't read it right after eating because it has some scenes that might upset your stomach! There is also excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can find parts of novels being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a bit of non-fiction, like a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers, and an interesting piece about herself by Ursula Owen. This is a special collection, and I am excited to see what next year's book will have.'"
PET_14,"The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when you are learning about the world."" Margaret lives in London and likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some eager five-year-olds. She began teaching the violin in 1972, and her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. 

Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, happening once every two weeks. In addition, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents must also attend the classes because it is important for them to be interested in the lessons.

From the beginning, students learn to play by listening. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how well they play and how well they read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. The new CD is called 'Here Again' and it comes after their last CD, 'The Waves'. There have been some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Also, Tom Simpson has joined the band as the drummer. 

From the first song on the CD, which is a dance song, it is clear that the band is not focusing on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. However, they are very good and could become hit singles. 

Singer Rob Letchford sings very well on this CD, hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be happy that he recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of his throat issues, the band had to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets should not worry because all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob is better.)

On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from the slow songs we know to the new dance songs that make you want to move. I think the best songs are at the beginning of the CD, and the last few songs are not as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big success and bring more fame to the band."
PET_36,"San Francisco

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find the area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was found by people traveling on land, not by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made money by owning banks and law firms, and they built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

PET_33,"Text: 'The History of Shoes In the past, people did not care if shoes were comfortable or fashionable. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles when it was cold. We still use leather today, but other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on what is in style. Only one hundred and fifty years ago, people started wearing a different shoe on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either the left or right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, even though some shoemakers still use traditional skills, most shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines helped the shoe industry make many cheaper shoes for more people.'"

I was upset because many race organizers complained that not many women join races, but they also didn't provide separate changing rooms for women. I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were of all ages and fitness levels. Most of them wanted to lose weight, but I don't think they had thought much about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined hard and painful training. They didn't think about running while chatting and smiling in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned from other runners about eating well and staying fit. I wanted to help women's running, and I have enjoyed watching their progress a lot - almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves.'"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there hoping to become rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One of these towns was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. 

In the summer, boats could bring important supplies to these towns. But in the winter, the rivers and ocean froze, so boats couldn't travel. In 1910, a winter trail was made for teams of dogs pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could sleep and eat, and feed their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes started to replace boats and dog teams. However, in 1925, a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were new, and people were not sure if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, the only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away. So, they decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. 

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to finish the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow, and Togo was a good guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to go further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

You can even get married there if you want. The bar is also made of ice, so it's not a good idea to put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are about -4°C, but guests get special sleeping bags to stay warm. If you need them, you can also get warm outdoor clothes.

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" A local newspaper wrote about the story, and Jose Craveirinha, who had helped other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her playing football outside the club. He noticed she was very fast. ""He talked to me about athletics. I didn't know what he meant because the only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot.""

Jose visited her parents and convinced them that Maria could be successful in athletics and that it could help their family out of poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she knew she would miss her family. Her life was very different from the girls she met in the US. She says, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

You start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of the most beautiful big cities in Canada. Vancouver is special because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains. People living there can ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city center. In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day on the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still a great adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you will travel through some of the most beautiful scenery at night."

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, while others wore bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were used to performing in competitions. The quality of playing was amazing, especially because everyone was so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played on stage!

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted. Only about half of the students do. But anyone who really wants to play goes to jazz practice before school. We often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I've been to a couple and learned a lot.

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. I find jazz exciting because it's both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel like you're part of its history, playing on stage like great jazz performers before you.

My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we wouldn't get anywhere with our music!"

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to big newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website if they are accepted by newspapers and TV or radio stations.

We have three centers in the country where young people can meet other members and join projects. We plan to open more centers across the country. Our news agency started in 1994 and was first called 'Young News'. Since then, over 2,500 young people have been members.

Sophie was one of our members. She says, ""I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities the young journalists had. Age didn't matter; they were trusted to do the stories on their own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, checking articles before they go online.""

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and join monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members who are 12 years old and over. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who go with them on these trips.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February.

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

**About the Flights**

During the short Antarctic summer, we offer sightseeing flights over Antarctica. We fly from Sydney, Australia, in a large passenger plane (Boeing 747) and return the same day. Flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, you can change your date if needed.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and then return home. During the flight, experts who have lived in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history. They also answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you the view from the cockpit on the plane's video system.

**Will I get a window seat?**

All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will change seats. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, you can walk around the plane to see the sights. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' so everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different flight routes. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the weather and chooses the route with the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica to protect the environment. To see wildlife, you would need to take a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, you can take photos. All cameras are welcome. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

For a group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are for learning how to cook seriously. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food.

Bill, who is ten years old, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to eat the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come.'

Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it's hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog might be waiting for you at the top of a hill. Ice can be hiding under the melting snow, ready to make you slide off the road. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, when you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so you don't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

Craigie Aitchison was a painter born in Scotland. He moved to London to study law but decided to go to art school instead. At art school, he found traditional drawing classes hard, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. There, he became interested in early Italian artists, and this can be seen in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. To do this, he painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark. He says he never knows exactly how the painting will turn out. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound easy, like anyone can do it. 'Anyone can use colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors go well together.' Unlike some artists, he doesn't make drawings before starting a painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why he likes models who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he hasn't felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He says he doesn't want to follow any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, we didn't like the idea because of the noise. Ben said, 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'Okay,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started coming to our home with their guitars and other electric equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must say that, although their music sounds a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private school in Wales. This school is special because it gives young people important experiences outside the classroom, as well as helping them study for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from all over the world. In the morning, they study, and in the afternoon, they do useful activities. These activities include helping on a farm, taking care of people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is that its students come from many different countries and social backgrounds. Since not many can pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, there are grants available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they get help from the government.

""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education with methods that really seem to work."
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an older student At 32, I have just finished my first year at university. I go to lectures regularly, and I have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I was earning a good amount of money, but I was bored because I didn't have to think much. I felt sad because I thought I would be stuck in that job forever. I was jealous of the students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am happy to study because I know I need a qualification to get a good job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends with my books instead of going to parties. There are also normal student benefits like long holidays and discounts at the theatre and cinema. I often wonder what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school at this age was a good decision.'"
PET_48,"Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cars that were cheap enough for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this also meant there were fewer choices. Henry Ford once said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family to travel to Asia with other climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is difficult. ""You have to carry everything on your back,"" she said, ""so you can only take what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I usually like to be clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!"" When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. She suddenly became famous. Now she has written a book about the trip, and people often ask her to talk about it. She also has a new job on a science TV show. Rebecca is well-known today and has more money, but she still lives in the small apartment in south London with her pictures and books about mountains!"

KET_13,"Text: 'CANADA GEESE Canada Geese are big birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to warmer places. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds can die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.' Bill had a small plane, and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he took short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When the cold weather came in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to return. They didn't come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but couldn't find them. When he got back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him!'"
KET_16,"Esther's Story

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, but Esther used her aunt's money to start a business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make her own jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and soon doubled her aunt's £500.

At first, her parents didn't want Esther to spend her time making jam. They thought she should study and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. But Esther didn't listen. She kept making jam. After a few months, she started selling it at the local market. Then she began making orange juice and sold it to a school where one of her friends worked.

After two years, her business grew very large, and her parents were very happy with her. She made all kinds of food and sold it to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to hire some people to work for her."

KET_46,"Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they don't get too hot. 

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer, and the weather was hot, so people didn't want to buy sweaters. Then she made some socks. Everyone loved them because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. That's how Jenny's business started. 

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had many customers, so she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, all the socks are made by machines. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favorite gift. In Jenny's office, there are many letters from happy customers from all over the world."

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave and forget to close a door or a window. He explained that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were always moving to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages slowly became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and then some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes.'"

KET_62,"People are interested in the weather for many reasons, and it is important for people in different jobs. For example, the weather is very important for farmers. Many years ago, farmers spent a lot of time looking at the sky, animals, and flowers to try to understand the weather. Now, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. Today, many people still believe in old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will rain soon."

Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. But recently, they have been spending their weekends in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework. They have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin, who has trouble reading. Kevin learns words better by seeing pictures and hearing sounds than by reading. Frazer wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for more than 200 hours to make the game, and now it is ready to use. It is a game with pictures and sounds. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there is a picture of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their game, and it will soon be sold around the world. Many schools want to buy it."

KET_58,"Bollywood

'Bollywood' is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It makes almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is more than the USA, making it the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians enjoy watching films more than any other free-time activity, and ten million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films usually tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of each film. Indian films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they do not earn as much money. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films in a career that has lasted almost 40 years."

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes came to England over 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer came more recently.

Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. Schnauzers come from Germany. Farmers in Germany use these dogs to help with their sheep. The police also use them because Schnauzers are very smart. A Schnauzer is a good family dog. It is friendly and very good with young children."

He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend money on lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy to do?

KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700, London did not have any policemen. A few old men used to watch the city streets at night, and they did not get paid much. About 300 years ago, London started to grow bigger. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, so people stayed in their homes as much as they could.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are paid quite well, and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others."

Many tourists come to the Festival to see new films and plays and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, you can watch over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries.

KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake turns to ice, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,"" he says. ""First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet some nice people here!"""

These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought them. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. Today, people use cars more than bicycles because cars are much faster, and you don't get wet when it rains! But some people still like to cycle to work. They say there are too many cars in city centers, and it's hard to find a place to park!"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were most excited about the elephant show. We went to a big area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of large white cards. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its card. Sometimes, the keepers gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, with help from their keepers, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they don't work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special places where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Big Cats

There are many kinds of big cats. They are different in size, and they do not look or act the same. Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail, they can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers often lie in water when it is hot!

Lions are the only cats that live in large family groups. Several lions work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and easily follow other animals.

All cats need good eyes because they catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong."
KET_36,"Dear Mrs. Brian,

I'm sorry, but I can't come to your class anymore because I have to go back to my country. My sister is getting married next month. I want to go shopping with her to choose a dress. My parents will make a big meal for the guests, and there will be a lot of work in the kitchen. I'm sorry I have to leave the English class. You are a very good teacher. Please say goodbye to the other students for me.

Thank you again.

Best wishes,

KET_33,"Dear Lorna,

How are you? I'm happy because I got a new job in the city center last month. I work in a Tourist Information Office, and it is very interesting. I start work every morning at 7:30, so I have to get up very early! I love this job because I meet people from many different countries. I like telling them about our city. Here is a photo of me. I'm wearing my new uniform. Do you like it?

KET_20,"Text: 'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Ostriches have wings like all birds, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, between 65 and 90 kilometers an hour, so it is hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and need about 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without drinking water.'"
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding when she was 20 years old. Now, she is 23 and has won many snowboarding competitions. We talked to her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland. We asked her why she started snowboarding. She said, ""I have always liked sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding was a natural choice. It doesn't take long to learn, and you can become really good in a few months.""

We also asked her if she practices a lot. She said, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because they are so beautiful. But free-riding, which is snowboarding for fun when not in a competition, is the best thing for me.""

We asked her what is important when learning to snowboard. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, at first, you spend a lot of time falling down!"""

I want to book a room at your hotel for three nights, from September 15th to 17th. I need a single room with a shower and a telephone. Can I have a quiet room on the ground floor, please? I will drive to the hotel. Does the hotel have a car park? I will arrive at about 10:30 p.m. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? If possible, I would like to have a meal when I arrive. 

Thank you for your help.

Yours faithfully,

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is thought to be the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro make it to the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and wet, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"Text: 'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their homes at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, which helps them stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, so many fish and insects died, and the otters couldn't find food. But today, there is a lot of food for them because the rivers are clean again.'"

Dear John,

Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a very good teacher. I enjoyed my time in Cambridge. Now, I am staying at my brother's apartment. He is studying to become a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go back home to Greece. I like London a lot. Yesterday, we went to Regents Park by bus. It was very sunny, and we had a great time. Tonight, I am going to watch a movie with my brother and some of his friends. I will write to you again from Greece.

Best wishes,

KET_59,"People have always built different kinds of buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We use buildings like museums to keep beautiful things safe. Many people work together to make a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures to show their ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, workers build it carefully. The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof. It looks nice from every side, not just from the top. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a famous roof. This interesting building looks like a glass tent."

KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. On the road between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a picture of a very large man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the village next to him is called Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think it was a very long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you go on the first of May when the sun rises, you will see all the people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.'"
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run the 10,000 meters and maybe the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in big races. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for that. Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, which is a very long road race. She won with the fastest time of the year for any British woman runner.

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also used to race when he was younger. But he had to stop competing because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him and he can't catch up. Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. But she always takes a break from running on Sundays. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything."""
KET_52,"Piano Players - When They Were Young

Ivan Petrov  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. Ivan's mother started teaching him piano when he was six. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began his first song.

Oleg Gagarin  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, Oleg started piano lessons with a teacher in his city. He quickly began winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Later, he returned to Russia.

Josef Heptmann  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he started playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef always liked music, but he was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now, but one day he wants to write his own music."
KET_28,"Bill Prince-Smith

Bill Prince-Smith did many jobs before he started writing children's books at 60 years old. He was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. His ten grandchildren don't live close by, but they also read his stories and say if they are good or bad. This way, Bill has learned what young children like to read.

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms nearby. His fifth book is his favorite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. 'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are so clever, they learn very quickly.' Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used new computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes film-makers change books, but they didn't change mine and I love the film.'"
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles on them, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap, and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because their newspapers did not have pictures then.'"
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur because they died out about 60 million years ago, long before people lived on Earth. We don't know exactly why they disappeared. Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 different kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest ones were larger than any other animals that lived on land. For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can hurt people. Bears are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. But they do not see well. Like most animals, they use their noses to find food. There are seven types of bears. The biggest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears. One type lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. Many people love the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard for them to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm parts of the world, like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You often see many crocodiles together in big groups. They eat anything they catch, such as fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat big animals or people. There are more than ten different kinds of crocodiles. All crocodiles have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Most crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles can live for a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"Text: 'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon that could carry people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew it. This happened in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they got jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a theatre today. The building was round and had no roof, so people got cold and wet if it rained. The queen loved going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to watch plays by William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors ate, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"
KET_48,"Dear Jeff,

I'm having a good holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is very warm, and I love swimming there. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home!

See you at the end of September.
