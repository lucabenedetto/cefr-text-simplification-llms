CPE_15,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. However, it might not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Households pay for it through local taxes, but the amount they pay doesn't depend on how much rubbish they produce. This means that a family producing a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple producing very little. The cost of rubbish disposal is not zero; more rubbish means more collectors, trucks, and landfill fees. Economists suggest that if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The solution could be to charge households for the waste they produce, encouraging them to throw out less and recycle more.

Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, studied this idea and found unexpected results. They looked at several American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags. Only bags with these labels are collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, residents were charged 80 cents per bag. While this seemed sensible, the costs of running the scheme were high. The number of bags decreased by 37%, but people simply packed more rubbish into each bag, reducing the weight of rubbish by only 14%. In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, rubbish weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying.

One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, but this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling. In a broader study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not significantly. A 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts rubbish by 0.3%. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything, which is unlikely with a small fee. Other factors like income and education might be just as important. In wealthier towns, people produce more rubbish and have less time to recycle.

Should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are needed to understand these effects, and sometimes the results are not as expected."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Success in a career is no longer enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even successful individuals often feel bitterness. Loving your work used to be enough to be envied, but now you must consider how your job affects you personally, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because if your skills make you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then no status or money will make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs, and how it can be redesigned to suit everyone, both women and men. Work should not only create wealth but also be a fulfilling lifestyle, a path to discovering hidden talents and making diverse human connections. However, this change doesn't mean eliminating unemployment. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A lifetime of work should be seen as a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class professions no longer have the appeal they once did. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, businesses and public institutions are downsizing. Efforts like decentralizing decisions, increasing skills, and performance-based rewards haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organizations.

I am investigating various occupations to see how they shape or harm those in them. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and how courage can be developed. I've applied this to major concerns like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts work to extend the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are part-time slaves, theoretically free to escape our drudgery, but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, used by others, working not to become better people, but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example, as 10% of the workforce is in the 'hospitality industry'. There's a lot of unused potential. Many intelligent and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep but a mini United Nations. People from around the world meet at hotels but usually pass each other silently. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the students they employ, instead of giving them only basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. But they are held back by accountants who say firms should focus on one core activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human, not just financial, perspective and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people want relationships based on independence rather than obedience, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that may seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more intimate encounter, creating respect between participants and valued as a way to understand another person, likely changing you in the process. It's more than relaxation; it's the most effective way to establish equality. Every time you have a conversation that achieves this, the world changes a little."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds by hand over a wide area. This agricultural metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest if conditions are right. It implies a central source of seeds, or resources, meant for spreading and reproduction. The question is why a new technology that could transmit words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this metaphor. Television, related to two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, was envisioned as a centralized 'mass' medium from its early days. This centralization matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. 

There were attempts to organize television differently, but they remained just thatâ€”attempts. Two notable alternatives highlight what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a potential telephone replacement. Popular science journals provided instructions for building TV transmitters and receivers, and amateurs were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. Thus, the chance for a more egalitarian form of television communication was lost, at least in Britain.

Broadcasting was tied to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. Despite amateur activities, television in the USA in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, seen as a competitor to the film industry. Public viewing was common in Britain and even more so in Germany. While grassroots, two-way television was marginalized, public reception systems operated in several countries in the 1930s. These systems could have threatened the domestic focus of television, but this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets as prices dropped. Centralized broadcasting to homes was the most suitable organization for the medium, given the division between public and private life in modernity.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as an entertainment center became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and broadcasting structures. Modernization led to centralization of capital and power, while breaking up traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile and isolated compared to stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments efficiently reach citizens with important information and fostered a sense of national community.

Broadcasting became the dominant form for radio and television due to these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to resources for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message is often: if you don't have this, you're not good enough. To see how much you're influenced, try not to read any ads next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us noticing. We see them everywhereâ€”on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internetâ€”all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**  
Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves impact our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, so cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateurs who explore caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather updates quickly, and computers solve complex calculations faster than humans can. Meteorological terms can be confusing to non-experts. However, simple weather wisdom is still important. Human experience is crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is the primary focus in opera, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken by the performers.

In musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge, but most are impressed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a flawless orchestra is easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics match; we see athletes doing something similar to running for a bus, but at a much higher level.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully understand an actor's skill and are not as impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually amazed when an actor delivers a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it should, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it connects with the listener's imagination. However, the traditional way music is presented, with strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists, can feel hierarchical. On the other hand, when audiences applaud between movements or after a solo, it can disrupt the performance, even if it shows appreciation.

Is there a solution? Yes, much is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I recall an event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience that involved the audience directly. 

I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes, using unusual locations can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts, but I believe music conventions can and should change.

I speak as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like plaster and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more flies around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

**Lock and Key**

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple beam behind the door has been replaced by electronic locks activated by a plastic card with countless combinations, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and explained what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and description in a novel can be cut without losing the main point. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In stage drama, speech often imitates real conversation, sometimes using language that seems redundant but serves to connect speakers. In some modern plays, this redundancy is extreme, making it hard to understand what is being communicated.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into another world, away from everyday reality, at least for the film's duration. Once the film ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. This temporary escape makes it easy to dismiss movies as mere entertainment rather than art. In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, viewed movies this way. They enjoyed being entertained but didn't see films as an art form.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but many small, similar rooms used for meetings. These rooms were hard to find without help. The studio lacked a central focus, with three main entrances that were all similar, making it difficult for newcomers to navigate. However, strangers were rare, as the studio didn't encourage their presence. Employees, familiar with the layout, worked together to create films that offered audiences a temporary escape from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookshops are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and launched his career. Rodriguez's success story is a modern example of dreams coming true quickly. In the past, filmmakers took time to mature, working behind the scenes before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without studio or TV support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city: rows of cramped, dull homes in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong sulphur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along the paths. Most of my early life is a blur. But I do remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, other memories appearâ€”faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. It's no surprise my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry or how to calm her. Even as a child, going with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as on a moor. Her solitude was paired with a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. This moral code was beyond my understanding: even now, I'm not sure I get it. Specifically, it meant not stepping into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting silently for long periods in the dining room, with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked; it meant countless rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said nothing except to agree with the main speaker, and Mrs. Labandâ€”more lively than the others, whom they vaguely disapproved of. It was only later that I realized how poor this company was; they formed a sad and depressing group, with inconsequential talk about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the duty to 'behave properly', lay on my shoulders, and I felt I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at that time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way (I remember aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seatâ€”these were strange contraptions made of cast-iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: an old man who lived next to Mrs. Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete once, at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pityâ€”a kind of junior charity, I thinkâ€”only for my mother to dismiss it, saying its organizers were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commonsâ€”and I'm not sure her mind could make such a leapâ€”it was as a kind of luxurious post office where rich people opened letters stuffed with five-pound notes sent by a gullible public. No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I overlook her virtues and highlight her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it had all been drained from her. To be fair, she wasn't unaware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take meâ€”in my 'good clothes'â€”on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, hand-in-hand, cautious but mindful of the free admission, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity, and she almost developed opinions on the subjects presented to her. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to say, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well from my childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was as familiar to me as the little rain troughs in the sidewalk, which I used to navigate on roller skates or my scooter. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to reflect a slight drop in social status: the porches were lower, and the front yards smaller. Over the years, changes had occurred: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had turned back into homes. I wondered how the residents adapted to living in spaces that once held merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. 'In my last place, living and working spaces were combined. It was hard to relax or start work when everything was in view.' So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. 'It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area, where I can either cook for friends or make coffee for clients.' To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental furniture from his parents or bought from markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Was Bruce Chatwin's life about escaping or exploring? This question has puzzled many. Chatwin's life and work were full of secrets, subtle connections, and sometimes lies. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed travel writing, with the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of extraordinary literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he would change or even ignore reality to make a story more interesting or to highlight a deeper truth. The book suggests that through travel, one can discover entire histories that seem to exist just to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a midsummer rainstorm, I hurried across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I watched the raindrops hit the water, creating small fountains that turned into bubbles and burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was during this intense rain in the summer of 1996 that I began to think about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, to escape the monotony of swimming laps and constantly turning back like a caged tiger. Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes reality seem more like a visual experience. Walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities because they help us reconnect with what is old and wild by getting off the beaten path and away from the official version of things. A swimming journey would allow me to explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin believed that crying had no clear evolutionary purpose, but he was likely mistaken. More recent studies suggest its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized crying's role in forming bonds between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. However, why adults cry is more complex. The sound of crying becomes less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, sometimes embarrassingly, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? While many people have an idea of what global warming is, its exact consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change weather patterns worldwide. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources for food, cities, and supporting billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are serious.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the past 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes future predictions uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have closely followed global temperatures for the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection.

Research shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6Â°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this is not a natural trend but partly due to human pollution. To predict future conditions, researchers use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use physics and chemistry to analyze climate factors like temperature and solar radiation. However, they are simplifications and have limitations, making their predictions only approximate.

Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than ever before. GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1Â°C to 3.5Â°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes could impact ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, and affect resources like food, water, and human settlements. Some effects might be irreversible and unfavorable, but not all. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage.

However, many predicted effects of climate warming are negative. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin has seen less rainfall and changes in seasonal patterns. Glacial changes could affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, aiding marine transport but increasing iceberg risks.

The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With half the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences could be severe. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face significant flooding, displacing millions and creating environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, potentially disappearing entirely, which would be devastating for their people and cultures, as well as for countries that would need to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as fuel efficiency is important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a challenging task, and the race is on to develop systems with new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will lead to important advances for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to develop theories about it. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can hinder our understanding of art.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that block new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on our lives. This separation builds a barrier around art, making it hard to understand its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, away from other human efforts and achievements.

Therefore, a key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, art theorists should show how art is connected to life.

To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the everyday experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We must approach the theory of art indirectly. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding art requires looking at the basic experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.

Many people enjoy movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories without considering them as art. This is because traditional art is often confined to museums and galleries, while people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often still separate art from everyday life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday experiences."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular imagination, lions hunting for food are seen as a marvel of teamwork: at sunset, a group of stealthy cats emerges from the shadows like trained hunters and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. Lions appear to be the perfect social animals, working together towards a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of observing these creatures in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by the number of surviving offspring, cooperation might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the inert noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions to the list. It has taken various research methods to uncover clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a milestone for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the style of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious angst, plain clothes, and loud guitars of the past; in came a lighter mix of melodic local styles. Social observation and strong emotions mixed easily with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a versatile team of songwriters. They explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, deep tracks like 'So Low', a beautiful tune about weather, and 'To the Brink', a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, an unmatched record in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', wise women who had influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more. He bought the last three for the full price. I realized even then that there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was a lesson I've never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I wanted to learn about, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to sort through it - the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior in the editorial department or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much influence, but they are on your side and looking for something original - the junior to make a name and find an author, the freelancer to justify continued work. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and sales potential, and also consider if you seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). They will also consider how promotable you are - an important factor when a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency during the early 1990s, you might have faced the toughest years of your career. The recession was severe, affecting industrialized countries more than expected. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in GDP, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and 75,000 homes repossessed. Every business was impacted, with some sectors like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% drop. Many people and companies worldwide suffered.

Advertising professionals were not unique in losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to support company profits and were closely watched by colleagues and bosses. They also had to work with shrinking budgets, being told to achieve more with less. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began focusing on producing what customers wanted, not just what was convenient for them. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was often seen as a cure-all solution.

With about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the responsibility often fell on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economic climate, but also because clients began questioning the value of advertising. Without clear evidence of its benefits, many companies doubted the return on their investment. Advertising was under scrutiny like never before.

Clients demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession led to debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often crucial for good advertising.

Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad. These factors, along with the economic situation, forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to increase successful advertising was high.

Help for those wanting to improve their advertising was scarce. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to share their insights. Successful companies were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which didn't help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't considered a desirable job. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs are known for having tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and poorly paid. However, these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The academic work was difficult, and the social life felt closed-off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this intellectual and social pretentiousness. It offered a seriousness and integrity that I found missing in my college life. But my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an aesthetic ideal for me. I first experienced this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I wanted to thank the chef who made it. I felt uplifted for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt like a distraction from my true passion. I educated myself by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and cooking elaborate meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand upright and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes, I said!"" The following week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt as if I were in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he couldn't diminish my joy. ""That's what they mean by 'free as a bird',"" I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of being a traveller is both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing icy, avalanche-prone mountains; who sail alone in small boats through huge waves; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available, and who can live for months in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It's easy to dismiss such people as oddities, which they are, and to categorize them with the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their strange, uncomfortable world is far from our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, grateful that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like running across a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is clearly competent. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that gives sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a ""fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea."" Raban argues that since the compass came into use about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus of the steersman's attention, so he no longer needs to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the helmsman's job is simply to stay on course, he can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer offers us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from different times or places because human experiences are universal. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings expressed clearly. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. This connection is even more striking if the book is from a distant place or time. We feel grateful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our senses are most alert in a new place, similar to when we read a great book. Books help us notice things we previously ignored. Our attention is drawn to details like the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we felt.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I've restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but added little else. I've corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right initially. Hindsight could allow more improvements, but that process would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but it fell a year later. Rewriting it to predict this would be claiming foresight, not reporting the moment. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, focused on understanding the present. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening to people with no qualifications except a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers aren't blind. Even a postcard can have purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for misused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting environmental awareness and tour operators' realization that travelers wanted to minimize their impact. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour involving cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or soft adventure is labeled ecotourism. The original motives were honorable, helping people make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard definition left travelers confused in an ecotourism jungle.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost the notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck a few years ago. It helped me reconstruct that time, but wasn't as reliable as it should have been. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one hospitable house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only took notes instead of writing a full narrative. Worried about details being out of order, I added many disclaimers. But realizing these pages weren't a guidebook, I let the story unfold naturally, without unnecessary caveats."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern trend, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians emphasize that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been developed, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For instance, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers fighting over promising manuscripts have given a false impression of the life of an average novelist. For those of us not topping the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that remain secure even if the book isn't immediately successful. Others, like me, are literary odd-jobbers, getting by with some teaching, occasional workshops, and articles like this one. I've heard of writing opportunities at a chocolate factory, but I've never managed to get one. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs and credit cards, and often with the help of those mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we performed at across the country started selling out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being mobbed by fans at village halls and ballrooms. On our nights off, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by followers. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Although my usual shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam explores their impact on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a rapid increase in ways to listen to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia techniques. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have declined. Access to music is likely to keep growing, as it meets many human needs. National events always include music, and for individuals, it offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is unimaginable. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind it will be, and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a major income source in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media. Besides its job importance, evidence shows playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. While these findings need more support, European data shows group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, including those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can develop transferable skills, like good study habits and punctuality from regular practice and concert participation. Therefore, there will likely be a demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.

What about the long term? Will there be a shift in focus, and if so, in what direction? I see two possibilities. First, the music people listen to will become more diverse, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making composition more accessible but possibly reducing the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that. Alongside this, more people of all ages will want to participate in music-making, likely in community settings reflecting local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to adapt. Instrumental teaching must change to allow more people to learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will impact the curriculum and assessment methods, which must adapt to stay relevant for a wider audience and include more musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They must motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with large, diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the high quality of music education available.

Finally, we must raise the profile of music. It plays a vital role in our lives but is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession must work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors often face criticism and mockery. This is partly because they sometimes talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichÃ©s or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked about her performance. Paul Scofield, a respected actor, once wrote that an actor's work is only alive during the performance. Discussing it makes it seem theoretical and empty. Each new play is a fresh start for an actor, who learns and grows with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next role. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, marked by simplicity and confidence. His command of the text and his self-control elevate him to a top-tier actor. Lester's Hamlet is a tense, watchful young man with a sharp wit and humor, making him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtly brilliant. Observe how his body language suggests a figure ready to come to life. Similarly, Handy's Horatio seems driven by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or an evocation? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors listen quietly, absorbing the words' impact. When it's their turn, they read a line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" actors breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from external or internal sources. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach with an open mind, trusting that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's disheartening if they treat it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between performers and the audience. Everyone should have a clear view and feel engaged with the stage. The auditorium's design is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the actors, it's flawed. Many late 19th-century theatres got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, suggesting layers of human presence. You can't cater to everyone with plays. Audiences don't always know what they want, so theatre should offer something unexpected and imaginative."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real impact was on the middle class and older generations. It set the stage for future rock stars who were inspired by its new and exciting sound. For Paul Simon and other young Americans, the main way to hear this music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was essential listening for many aspiring rock musicians. Like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. This fascination led him to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow Adventure**

There was no clear path, but I thought I could manage if I was careful. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I struggled on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow beneath me collapsed, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between rocks, which gave way under my weight. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried about what could have happened if the hole had been deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess my situation. After an hour, I had only covered half a mile. It was obvious I needed to change my plan.

**Understanding Qualitative Research**

There are many books that guide researchers on qualitative research, but they often don't explain how to analyze the data collected. Many researchers find data analysis mysterious. To address this, we asked social scientists who have done qualitative research to share their methods. The goal was to provide insight into the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a step-by-step guide. This involves making hidden processes more clear, which is not as easy as it sounds. We allowed contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. His answer was, not much. There's a trend to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning through a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program and his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. Television, as my son and his noodles show, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches directly. Research indicates that learning happens best in environments where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. While new technology can be useful for teaching, formal education still plays a crucial role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals were not happy, seeing their Los Angeles suburb changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. A good film might make a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it remains a small community with limited views, just a part of Los Angeles. For those living and working there, the main topic is films: how much they earn, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Successful people often try to live elsewhere but work in Hollywood. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. They wanted a lasting, accurate record of their surroundings and found it. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and a chemical-coated surface produced images more detailed and realistic than paintings. This caused concern among other artists, and critics argued that photography was not true art. They believed that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of creative imagination. Despite this, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of art. They used photography to interpret the world and present a vision of nature and its elements, just like artists use brushes and pencils.

**Book Illustration**

During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This included novels for older readers, although these saw fewer illustrations as print runs decreased. Children's publishing was active but often operated on low budgets, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always delivered high-quality work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of ordinary and exceptional work, a great resource for research or exploration. The true treasures are likely to be rediscovered, either through reissues of individual titles, new publications about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may soon see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as facsimile reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

A while back, a website warned about the dangers of public check-insâ€”telling everyone where you are online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This highlighted the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers endless chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we might get lost. 

Feeling discouraged? Don't be. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. These pioneers explored the web's dangers long before social media existed. They faced job losses, made and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of fame. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teens. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In 1996, he started a daily blog, attracting readers with his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others recognized the artistic value in his work.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall realized that sharing his life online made people distrust him. He chose to end the blog, but the issue remains. Sharing online is appealing, but if you expect it to make people like you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog's address to company executives, including those she had criticized, leading to her dismissal. This situation illustrates the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. However, our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was initially upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online oversharing, she has mastered the art of controlled self-expression. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often said to be a common issue today. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also become more common. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans are chronically affected by sleep problems. In Britain, some popular novels feature insomniacs or are set in sleep-research labs. There is a growing interest in sleep: its patterns, benefits, and issues. A key concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up too early to avoid traffic.""

A sleep researcher conducted an experiment offering participants the chance to sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at an average of eight-and-a-quarter hours, showing they were catching up on lost sleep.

In Europe, these ideas are tested at a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands. The lab studies various topics, like the effects of fatigue on sailors and the impact of airport noise on sleep. They recruit participants through student newspapers, paying them Â£5 an hour to adjust their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab's focus is physical.

In a dark room, a motorway simulator is set up. Participants arrive at 2 pm, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short or sleepless night. They drive while answering questions, facing a projected road with glaring sunlight. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. Initially, the driver is alert, but soon starts blinking and nodding off. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but the car veers off the road. A coffee might help; Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even without sleep. She suggests alertness products like tablets and energy drinks, especially for shift workers.

What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they move through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually occur in the lightest sleep, and the brain paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some suggest sleep repairs tissues, restores muscles, or rests the brain's speech and creativity areas. But these might happen during relaxed wakefulness, so it's uncertain. However, scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, though the reasons are unclear.

When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a ""morning sleep."" This break was a time for reflection or even night-time activities. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily constraints. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich adopted a more efficient sleep pattern, similar to today. The industrial revolution extended work hours for most people, except some in rural areas.

Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then wake up. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In certain tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for predators make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems that people worldwide are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"Text: 'I was wearing expensive cowboy boots, standing on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I knew I wasn't a real cowboy. I had flown in from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy, but that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was carrying a dirty bag. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word. 

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore, and I can't. Now, I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I thought I could be a commentator for races, but there are already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work out. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a World Champion. Even if I had been, people would only listen for a short time. 

I don't want sympathy. I had a good career and made money. But I miss racing. I miss the thrill of driving fast cars and the excitement of the races. I miss the attention and the people who cared about what I said. Now, I have a lot of free time. The phone rarely rings, and my days are empty. 

As I looked at the Arizona sky, I noticed some birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave. I realized I had a lot to learn, just like a fake cowboy in designer boots.'"
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past decade, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, residents often walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you'll likely hear a different language with almost every step. People are attracted to Vancouver for its mild climate, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and educational and job opportunities. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to the city's revival. Locals used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. While the name is less popular now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are usually not great at writing letters. Some say it's because we dislike writing without getting paid, but I don't think we're that money-driven. It's more likely that, since we're always trying to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural flow needed for letter writing. Real creative artists, who don't focus on the impact of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I believe that understanding the effect of their words is the true test of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the contrast between long words made them effective, yet it showed his greatness as a writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, the opening of a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Now, new branches open so frequently that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy branch, as long as they were at the front. One customer, who knew someone working there, said the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and the latecomers envious."
CPE_53,"Text: 'Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the film. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, it was not a commercial hit. It was television that later brought it back to public attention. Citizen Kane is perhaps the most influential film for aspiring filmmakers. This is especially surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles claimed that its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had an exceptional team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm. Dermot and Carmel Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to chat with someone, and it was the best place for it. Twice, Carmel nodded in agreement but seemed distant, as if she hadn't really heard him. 'Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?' he asked. She smiled and said, 'It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might stroll downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost sinful to just idle the day away.' Dermot smiled back. 'You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble.' 'No, that's fine,' she replied. Title Race Tea boy? No, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of envy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our vanity is so strong that it overcomes even basic greed, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as a subordinate. The titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just euphemisms.'"
CPE_55,"Text: 'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. Photography was more than just my job; it was a part of my life. The way light fell on a surface always sparked my imagination. A single picture could capture the essence of a time, place, or person. I was always searching for that perfect photograph, as long as I had film in my camera. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking. That was my approach. I once came close when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, mostly luck. After that, I went freelance, which seemed like a smart move, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties didn't turn out as successful as I had hoped, even after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad. The assignment came by chance. I had done the London shots for a picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the Vienna job, and they offered it to me. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available. Things at home weren't great, so I was happy to go. They put me up at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip. This time, in cold January, it was different. I knew it the moment I arrived and saw the city covered in snow. I was going to enjoy myself and take great pictures. The first day, I just explored, riding trams around the city. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons. This was going to be my Vienna. A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for it. I waited and observed until I was ready. The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow had fallen overnight, making Stephansplatz white and empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire reached into the sky, but at ground level, it was massive. I might have to settle for a partial shot, but it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality. Even when you understand the process, the mystery remains. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me.'"
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

London's Hayward Gallery, known for its serious atmosphere, has been transformed into a place of wonder. This change is not due to a big-budget, heavily promoted event, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the past 60 years. The new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which focuses on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an ongoing, though often overlooked, theme in fascinating creative work of this century. Curator Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying kinetic art, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are presented with minimal text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art appeals to many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and witty comments, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but this might be because being popular is not always seen as a good thing today. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to judge his work against an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and understands that only time will tell how his work is viewed.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

Recently, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by their claim to be art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but complemented each other through contrast. I didn't make any grand statements about contemporary art, but perhaps there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will spoil their experience. Some suggest that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the creativity of art. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method detracts from enjoying the dish. Understanding an object can enhance our enjoyment of it. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be examined. Our preferences are influenced by societal values, not just personal taste. While sensuous responses to art are important, the idea that intellect undermines them is outdated, from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for a fish or just relaxing, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became popular. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became one of their important skills.

**St Ives**

We walked silently, carrying our bags down the winding, cobbled lane into the town center. We struggled against the strong wind and tried to avoid the icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track train. As the grey skies darkened, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seemed like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hardships are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't replay history. However, computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how this virtual society reacts."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that signaled a leopard was near. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking across open ground, revealing his deception.

**What Cats Catch**

In the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these figures, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals annually. However, this calculation is misleading because most cats live in towns and catch less prey than rural cats. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not devastating to Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are essential to marshmen and are well cared for. Each morning, they leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to distant reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's fatigue, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow for a while. Eventually, they swim away, appearing exhausted, with only their noses above water. They spend the day among reeds and bulrushes, grazing on green shoots at eye level.

**Picasso, Pablo - The Soles (1940)**

In early 1940, Picasso painted several fish still lifes while in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and soles on a pair of scales. The sea creatures appear alive despite their situation. Picasso used overlapping and interlocking transparent planes, creating a flat pattern. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors give the painting an underwater feel of calm and harmony. However, this is disrupted by an impending battle between the fish and the crab. The sharp forms and the chain around one fish add a sense of menace and violence, giving the painting a symbolic edge."
CPE_12,"Photography Over the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all aspects of human life and activity. In this relatively short time, it has expanded its ability to record time and space, allowing us to see fleeting moments and visualize both large and small details. Photography has shown us images from remote parts of the world, distant areas of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has become one of the most important ways to express the human condition. However, the recording of events through images has a much longer history. The earliest pictorial recordings date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. Although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of early cave paintingsâ€”whether they recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious icons, or simply brightened domestic lifeâ€”images seem to be deeply connected to human culture. Throughout history, questions have been raised about the accuracy of visual images and their status in society. The idea that 'seeing is believing' has always given special importance to visual images. So when photography was invented in the mid-19th century, its social and cultural impact was huge. Photography was seen as a way to automatically provide a truthful visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was thought to produce a fixed image very close to what we actually see. The chemical process of fixing the image captured what was considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, photography was seen as a cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long struggled to create. Ironically, because of the camera's perceived realism, it was assumed that everyone would naturally understand photographs. This led to the question of whether photography was a 'universal language'. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rapid increase in global communications in the late 20th century, we need to ask how well photographic images can cross cultural differences. Is photography as bound by cultural conventions as language? Is it possible that our familiarity with photographs has made us overlook the medium's ability to convey vivid impressions of 'reality'? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making the medium seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, 'this is my grandson'. Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This may be because photography has moved into 'mythic time'â€”its role as a 19th-century record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once immediate and close to both photographer and subject, have now become historical documents. These documents often reveal as much about the people and society that produced them as they do about their subjects. I aim to show that the camera is not just a passive recorder of events and that photography does not merely reflect culture but can inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing the role of perspective in new visual representation. Similarly, photography has contributed to the media culture of our era while also bringing the harsh realities of the world to our coffee tables."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry can be unpredictable, like walking through a minefield. You need spontaneity, but one wrong move can disrupt everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky. For beginners, no advice can replace reading a lot, writing often, and freeing your imagination in a productive way, without causing chaos. Some people need stability to write a poem, while others write to escape sadness. Some follow a schedule; others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid as long as they aren't just copying a set formula. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long narratives. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify something. A character's memory can help move the story forward, but it shouldn't slow down the action. Dialogue is useful because it can show different perspectives quickly and keeps the reader interested. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but brevity shouldn't make it feel like a summary. Conflict and action should be as strong as in a novel, but every word must count in a short space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing the outcome, seeing only a few moves ahead. Over time, they realize that chess is about long-term strategy, not just short-term tactics. They start to see the game as a whole, noticing patterns like openings and endgames. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin noted that humans naturally speak, but writing is not instinctive. Language exists in all societies and doesn't necessarily improve over time. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and if they lack a language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history and developed slowly. Many children struggle to learn to read and write, even today. Writing is not natural like speaking; it must be learned with effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to name it. I have little story to tell, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between. I could invent details to make the story more coherent, but I don't want to. I just want to share what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters made-up names and taken care to ensure they are not recognized. The man I write about is not famous. He may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But perhaps his chosen way of life and his unique character might influence others, and long after his death, people might realize he was remarkable. Then, it will be clear who I write about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for his biographers. I don't claim the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me. Though I put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty, like historians, to create speeches for scenes I didn't witness. I did this to make the scenes lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. The intelligent reader will see where I've used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason for my hesitation is that the people I write about are from another culture. It's hard to truly know people, especially those from a different country. People are shaped by their birthplace, childhood games, food, schools, sports, and poets they read. These experiences make them who they are, and you can't fully understand them unless you've lived them. You can only know them if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another nation just by observing, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have in short stories, it's because you can describe characters briefly there. You give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the literary world often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It's only later that patterns and rankings become clear. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many styles, debates, and ideas about the poet's role in society. Generally, there is a divide between 'literary' poets, who write for reading, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their work. However, this division isn't strict. Public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, from small town halls to schools and arts festivals.

For 'pop' poets, who write for live audiences, public performances are beneficial. Their work is often simple and easy to understand in one hearing, but may seem lacking when read on the page. In contrast, poets who focus on traditional craft, aiming to pack deep meaning and rhythm into their work, may not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is not that they will mimic entertainers, but that they might choose to read only their simpler, less representative work to connect quickly with the audience.

Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry, but it can be a fun and educational addition. Hearing poets read their work helps listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm, especially if they follow along with the text or know the poems beforehand. The main benefit of popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is that they make poetry enjoyable and accessible, rather than something only for a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but it has challenges. It's unrealistic to think someone's account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses the informant and the topic, and even if they just listen, their presence affects how the informant remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their way of understanding history, which can influence the informant. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the informant's memories aren't directly connected to the past. Memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia and later life experiences. Emotions in the testimony can seem convincing but might come from later events, not the period being discussed.

**Animal Science**

Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, like how nerves and muscles work together for complex behavior. The whole animal approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are distinguished. Psychologists usually study learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behavior in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding nerve cells doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure and must be studied at its own level. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cell actions is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research in textbooks and the methods used to obtain and organize this knowledge. These elements are closely related. We might think social sciences are common sense because we experience social life daily. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific aspect of social life, uses particular study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, allowing social scientists to go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing each discipline.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function aren't part of his definition, though he later discusses the best forms for different structures. Initially, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. There was a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These basic forms contributed to later sophisticated architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. Despite this, Chen was amused when he found out what his wife had been doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street full of empty parking spaces, preferring to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. She hoped this would ease Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked them carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked, ""No one will want that heap of tin."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He lifted Man Kee onto the railing and held him close. Man Kee, warm and increasingly responsive, put his small hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way, ensuring he got a good education and eventually owned many restaurants.

The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a trail of smoke on the horizon and then a ship appeared, shimmering in the sunlight. There was a telescope nearby, and Chen used it to look at the ship. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It will take us back home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls in the distance."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't consider how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but let go, and I fell into the well, hitting my head. 

At first, I was dazed and saw strange lights, like the stars and planets in cartoons when characters get hit. I was scared, then relieved, but also angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I was about to shout back when I heard panic in your voice, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. 

I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and Arthur. Mother was panicking, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to my hiding spot. I was terrified someone would see them. 

Father shone a flashlight into the well, and Mother was screaming. I realized my prank had gone too far and would lead to serious trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. I needed a plan. I gathered my courage, left my hiding place, and pretended to be weak and exhausted. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. 

I almost got away with it until Father asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated, and he looked at me with disbelief. I added that the tunnel had collapsed, so no one could check it. Father dismissed my story with contempt. Arthur looked at me with pity, seeing through my lie and worrying about my future. His look was as painful as Father's words, making me realize the seriousness of my actions."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, now a widow with grown children, is leaving her family home. The moving van, labeled 'Removers of Distinction', was taking away everything that made the house special. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house overlooking a small harbour. Memories of her children growing up lingered in the air like dust. 

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also there, insisting she handle the Steinway piano herself.

Fred commented that Susan didn't seem like she would cry. ""Do people cry?"" Susan asked. ""You'd be surprised,"" Fred replied. ""They help until everything's in the van, then they cry in the empty room. They're fine at the new place. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.""

Susan could understand. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their job to notice. The piano stood alone in the best room, waiting to be moved last. Sitting on the bottom stair, as all the chairs were gone, she remembered when they first moved in. The piano had been brought in first and got stuck on the stairs. It took hours to get it inside, with young Robert watching and Francesca crying, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!""

Her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to lift the piano inside. It was expensive, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. ""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were busy, and Susan found it hard to move around the house.

She worried about the piano getting stuck again. Fred reassured her, ""It's just the piano to come now."" Susan moved from the stair, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca watched from the hallway. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked. Susan was close to tears, realizing how moving things made them important. 

As the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, Fred guided it down smoothly. Once it was outside, Robert laughed first, and soon all three of them were laughing uncontrollably, relieved it was over. They walked arm in arm down the path for the last time, with Susan shedding tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?**

From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish or share content online. In practice, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to express their opinion about a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it provided free reviews for Amazon and gave potential buyers insights from other readers, not just publishers or professional critics. Other online bookstores offered similar features, but Amazon, with over 80% of the online market, attracted the most reviews and, consequently, the most issues.

This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, making it impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team of editors to ensure reviews followed guidelines. Reviews with single words, personal attacks, obscenities, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This allowed for some mischief. For example, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. Lev Grossman, unhappy with negative reviews of his first novel, wrote several positive ones himself until he confessed in an article, leading to their removal.

Authors could also comment on their books through a special link. Most used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books, sometimes even sharing their email addresses. However, Amazon did not verify if the comments truly came from the authors, except for famous ones. A fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed after being identified as false.

The real drama came from reader reviews. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it received positive reviews from the press. However, people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but were later removed. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as beneficial for business. Reviews were meant to be a 'forum to talk about a book,' not a chat room, so popular books were closely monitored to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book, inspired humorous reviews because 'ping' is also a term used in Internet technology. One review humorously compared the book's plot to Internet architecture.

Despite some silliness, most reviews on Amazon were serious and provided a reliable indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing reactions to books one didn't care about. This makes the democratization of the review process seem like a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people have started to believe that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often express these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation can make us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in modern art. We expect artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that break conventions. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, making it part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to create on their own and get frustrated if they try to connect with ordinary life.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book. The text discusses the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any decorative touches. The question is: is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until 26th June, there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and attempts to change direction are often met with disappointment. Gallery owners prefer safe investments, and the art-buying public may find comfort in continuity. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully break this mold. Eric Rimmington is another artist challenging expectations. His new show moves away from the still lifes that made him famous to paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington has always been fascinated by railways. After drawing the railway land of London's Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, he logically turned his attention underground. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings capturing the unique atmosphere of this underground world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel suspended in memories. I spoke of the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The solace in my work lies in the ability to reorder reality in the silence of painting or writing. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering hiding the true meaning beneath. For artists, art offers a joyful compromise with the challenges of life, not to escape destiny but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the posh girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. After a long talk with my headteacher, we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually very talkative. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you'll get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be bold. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

Like many children in family trades, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about such things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died early in my childhood, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or was he jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his hour of need.

As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever his single-mindedness, the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his dynamic energy, and perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being extremely careful with money, which made it a bad decision. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money, and since her job was far away, Simon had to be the one to do it. The crowded tube ride made him resentful, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated with care and respect. His grandmother was a 'lawyer's wife' who supported legal causes and was content with her role. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries. Now, their hard-earned stability was threatened by Venetia, who had confronted Simon with anger. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a past case and of accepting shares for his fiancÃ©e. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He wished he had been prepared and could have responded better. Venetia's anger and disgust puzzled him. He wondered why she felt the need to challenge him and if her own actions were always perfect. He feared that if the accusations spread, even as rumors, his career would be ruined."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live, thinking I would find anonymity among people who didn't mind if the rented houses fell apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I'm watching the swifts flying between the treetops and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back rosemary and lemon balm. It's a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished manuscripts that I sometimes have to pretend to like as an English teacher. I have her latest one now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair while I put a cushion on the grass. 'Cheers,' she says, 'I should've gone into teaching - a writer doesn't have holidays. Still, you know what they say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And there are those who can neither write nor teach. 'So, what plans for the holidays?' 

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements with melting chewing gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness beside me on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Could you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course I will,' Jaz says, knowing she would be around. 'Where will you stay? Some fancy B and B?' 'No. I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my manuscript?' Jaz asks about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning rejected manuscripts to hers. I decide to be honest. 'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks, offended. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good: less focus on yourself, more fiction...' 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal,' I say, 'where I write something good about each day.' My words sound old-fashioned. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 

Oh, I've got a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me, then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage gives people and communities a real connection to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond this, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps assure our future. Just as you inherit genes, you also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of your national heritage you dislike, but it is still yours, and it is comforting to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, affecting everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link to the past was through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities and families, causing much of that oral tradition to be lost. Now, places and architectural 'memories' provide clues to our past. It is crucial to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started a novel, ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England played a major role. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection, chose to write about the Fens. The short answer is that I chose them for their apparent simplicityâ€”a flat and empty stage for my book's drama. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as richly English as any other part of England but also strangely compelling. It is remarkable that in the middle of England, there is a region that many English people find foreign, even when other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural and literary heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open and mysterious. My research for the novel was not extensive; I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I am interested in imagined worlds and prefer to make inspired guesses rather than seek documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays can be lively and interesting, using theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors' attention and stimulate emotional responses. Museums should do more than just display items; they should make collections accessible to the widest community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers and materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on 'artefacts and specimens'â€”not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CD-ROMs. Museums that embrace this distinction and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that their competitors in 'virtual history' are actually allies, creating a desire for the 'real thing' that only museums can satisfy.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that most of us are affected. This turns some people into strong preservationists and encourages others to think about the nature of towns today and their future. It can be argued that generations who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before themâ€”anything that expresses stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not an enemy if we learn to manage it. Physical change in our towns reflects social change, such as changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will likely mention Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products related to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about his work, except that he developed theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and making strange predictions that seem to contradict everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thinking, marking the start of modern science in the twentieth century. Scientists were trying to create a new, more logical description of the universe by studying the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by re-examining the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, descriptions relied on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed framework of space and time. Einstein changed this view, suggesting that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I avoided prize-winning books because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money, chapter by chapter, to encourage us to read some educational books. He would also sneak in a few high-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, clearly marked as 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we dismissed most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some shorter, good fiction and, on one occasion, a well-known collection of poetry.

**Language**

""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous,"" wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. This mystery has inspired many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller suggested that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. ""Meuh"" has a sad sound. Humans wandering through dangerous lands filled with fearsome animals made desperate noises, and languages have kept some echoes of these cries, like the word malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of such odd theories, many avoided the topic, seeing it as a field for eccentric ideas. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly interaction and played a key role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's view of language as a 'great conduit' for conveying knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them relevant for only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they remain relevant only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear inâ€”usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a task done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. Writing a concise and fair review in six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed six to eight thousand-word piece for an international journal. A fifteen hundred-word article in a weekly magazine presents challenges of both short and long formats. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer must know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This often means that reviewers also write other types of work. The American novelist John Updike, who views criticism as ""hugging the shore,"" still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think lesser-known writers should accept the temporary nature of reviews, it's understandable if they seek some permanence and recognition, especially if they believe their best work is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, there isn't a strict separation between reviewing and literary study. It's common for the same people to do both. The days when academics criticized professors for writing reviews are mostly over. Complaints from non-academics that professors are taking their opportunities are also less common, partly because there are more reviews to write now, and partly because the rewards are often small. I believe these arrangements benefit both readers, who can trust the reviewer knows the subject, and professors, as it helps them stay grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-academics. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when addressing intelligent non-academics. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary activity. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, still hallway, felt a brief moment of doubt about owning it. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came over him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, curious about what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, a space where he was in control. He thought he should worry about intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he began to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated with its inability to change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat vandalized, though he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the artificial world of the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often overlooked in his social plans. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but once home, he felt empty and waited in vain for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that doing work he didn't enjoy had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would often read or listen to music as the night went on, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and thoughts and ideas would come and go, unable to connect. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel this powerless, when he might have escaped if he had recognized his own worth. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but wasn't surprised to find he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find work that would make him happy. He attended his only job interview gratefully and didn't think to evaluate the positionâ€”a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't consider the long meetings he would now face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, crowds of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was set up as a course for the race. It wasn't like professional racecourses, but the idea was the same: spectators stood on either side of the track. Organizers were trying to keep a few special goats in order, which was difficult because goats are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I worried about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, with our torch, we could barely see the cliffs. The torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. We realized we wouldn't find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You are not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you're saying. Show your belief through passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start by creating a positive atmosphere. Begin with something everyone agrees on and gradually lead to your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will tighten. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing mental math, but some mental processes cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or become more complicated, like the fishing line. Demanding quick results can be as unproductive as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, each suited to different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted instantly to keep me safe. This fast, physical intelligence is often called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself, which involves reasoning and problem-solving. A mechanic fixing an engine or a student working on an assignment uses this kind of intelligence, often called ""intellect."" People good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is a slower mental process, which is more relaxed and contemplative. When we are lost in thought by the sea or just waking up, we are in this mode. This slower way of thinking is just as important as faster thinking. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury but a necessity, especially when life gets demanding. Slow thinking is crucial for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems, like choosing a holiday destination. But for complex issues, like managing difficult people at work or considering a career change, slow pondering is more effective. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long understood the limits of deliberate thinking and have embraced slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have explored the mind beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun studying these slower mental processes. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can handle complex tasks if given time. It can learn subtle patterns, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than conscious thought."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, anxious like I hadn't been since my first weeks at school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage my speaking skills usually give me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face, though, and when I saw him again, he would shake hands with me politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films. He focused on the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are affected by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is designed well for emotional impact, audiences from Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He aimed for pure film and the precise, calculated beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make almanacs and charts, and they help us analyze observations and publish results. This could be considered the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. You might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Society today has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the latest product or service, and technology speeds up these changes. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can be overwhelming and stressful, leading to a feeling of disconnect from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'â€”simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I dislike the rudeness and familiarity of shop assistants today, and I don't like waiters who act too friendly. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and privacy is rare in commercial places these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

The transfer of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the main role and underestimated his acting skills. Although I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, I must admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is truly remarkable. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Unforgettable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are incredible. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, everything is still. While the edges of the continent are full of penguins, seals, and birds, the vast white plateau in the interior is lifeless. However, beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on earth, lies a huge hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms might live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers worldwide have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if successful, the next few years could be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is getting quite passionate about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the timeless quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists are curious about why we want to know all this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to consider whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking might already agree with this, as they often buy cookbooks like this one. We sometimes think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes, but that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by adding some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs to water. This is much more satisfying than using a packet or a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too many preservatives and additives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will love. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is rich in symbolism and meets our deep human needs, which is why our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries, often happen around tables. No one would choose a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing. Owning an apartment building added even more paperwork. Books and journals were piled near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be punctual for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was as precise about time as she was about neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her expression showed she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**

Karen's simple wish to be different from her mother led her to create her own story, a story of strength and uniqueness. In her personal tale, there were key moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed as a reminder of past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty walked quickly across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's thrilling to be the first to know something important, and her quiet life rarely had excitement. However, she was deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. His most valuable trait, she thought, was making patients feel he had plenty of time and genuinely wanted to hear their concerns. This quality made him beloved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are captivating, even for those who aren't musically inclined. At a recent concert for children, after playing various styles like classical, jazz, and blues, a young boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" For Joanna, this was amusing, and she easily fulfilled the request, proving herself to the young audience.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how children learn the piano. She has published an elementary piano tutor for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even with her busy schedule. She is involved in many projects, including running her own recording label, Sound Circus. Despite her commitments, she believes the first piano lessons are crucial. She feels that music should be accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent.

Her experience teaching beginners and growing up in a home where her mother taught piano has influenced her approach. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children progress quickly, but she is more interested in those who enjoy playing at their own pace, even if they eventually stop.

Joanna is concerned that some parents push their children to achieve in music rather than letting them enjoy it. She thinks children often quit because they can't meet their parents' expectations. Her books aim to make learning fun, with storylines and CDs to accompany the lessons. She encourages improvisation and exploration of the piano.

As children progress, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. Joanna, who relied on her ear as a child, understands this challenge. She believes practice is essential, though she admits she didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music. Now, she practices eight hours a day, which she considers the core of her musical life.

Joanna advises that practice should have clear goals, whether it's for twenty minutes or five hours. She suggests rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even with mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This suggests that good writing is often difficult. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they have very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard work. Writing slowly helps the brain focus. When it's hard to change or erase something, you write more carefully. On the other hand, using a computer can make you careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers who aren't used to the power of words might exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and character of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was plain, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he returned. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi. Lights came on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. You could make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my chair. ""Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a question he couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd think they were an improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take generations. This kind of thinking is self-centered, believing our generation is at a historical turning point. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. So far, that hasn't happened. Reading long texts on a screen is so unpleasant that most people avoid it. Computers encourage people to read in bits and pieces. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, aren't read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw everything perfectly organized. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was laid down, and the desk was the dark wood he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they'd had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, more as a statement than a question. She had been making Lancelot coffee for months, so she should know. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time, realizing that staying away would lead to chaos. He often thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis; he wanted a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the firm. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned for books. Ian's unpredictable nature made him even less reliable. Lancelot skimmed the synopsis, recognizing almost every phrase. He closed the folder, realizing Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt uninspired. Lancelot recalled stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, coaxed out chapter by chapter. But Ian's advance had been huge, a reversal of the usual business practice where authors deliver a manuscript before being paid. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers had quickly taken over British theatre, but Ian's energy seemed unmatched. He wore his coat like a cape and spoke of famous writers as if he knew them personally. Yet, Ian's creative potential remained untapped. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. As a literary influencer, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he failed to produce even one issue despite using the budget for twelve. His contract with a fashion magazine resulted in stories about his high salary, which increased in hopes of making him produce more, but he produced little. At editorial meetings, Ian was critical and sarcastic. Ten years later, he was unreliable even for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'England's breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts, but historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and to the sick having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast gradually became common. Some writers say this was because food became more available. However, they often overlook other important social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important, as people started working set hours, often very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their skills, personal views, and social and cultural norms. This book will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might understand the photos on the page without thinking about them deeply. However, we can ask if the photo truly shows the scene as it was or if it reflects the photographer's perspective. Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-belief. To succeed, you need to focus entirely on your goal, putting everything else aside. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, and it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows individual excellence, but it's also a team game, so you must balance both. Like in life, you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened doors and shown me things around the world that others may never see. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they stand out in our memory. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt drawn into a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird's performance seemed like an incredible improvisation. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through the window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 'Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports. There's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a small brown bird hits the glass. It's a wren: a bird often seen as a sign or omen. Is it trying to send a message from a world beyond our understanding? Or is it just a bird trapped in a greenhouse? Both could be true, depending on your perspective. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens are common in British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. A forest without wrens feels empty. This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, from a time when people relied on nature for survival. They developed a language to express the importance of animals. This significance can change over time. For example, in the early 1500s, red kites were common in London and seen as helpful scavengers. Later, they were considered pests and nearly disappeared, except in Wales. Now, they are protected and seen as symbols of conservation. Our bond with birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds to learn about predators, weather, and food, and saw them as links to the spiritual world. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, reflecting our own identity and connection to nature. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but they remain part of us. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is a cultural loss as well as an ecological one. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize love and magic. Their decline is felt deeply by those familiar with literature and folklore. However, the loss of birds not featured in stories often goes unnoticed. Folklore is important because it connects us to birds in a way that scientific terms cannot. It evokes feelings and memories buried beneath modern life. Whether watching wildlife films or birds in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we struggle to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding the key to a mystery that keeps us curious.'"
CPE_28,"Text: 'Maps The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface using distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in time units, like 'a day's journey by river', which told more about how easy it was to travel the terrain than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, written itineraries were popular alongside maps for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, may not show true directions. Early maps used signs to mark landmarks, with their size indicating importance. The conventions used in maps varied depending on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is key when studying old maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and making maps more comprehensive. Cartography has used other sciences to help, like using the magnetic compass instead of relying on shadows or stars for direction. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, maps became more detailed. Discoveries like the earth being slightly flattened at the poles led to more precise mapping. Over time, the users of maps expanded beyond travelers and merchants to include soldiers, archaeologists, historians, and geographers, each with specific needs. Modern cartographers have developed ways to map various distributions, such as geological layers and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography. However, the development of cartography has not been continuous or consecutive. There have been times of slow progress and rapid development, with old ideas persisting alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what was needed for progress but had to wait for better technology. Since copying old maps was easy and printing was costly, publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be accepted uncritically as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so fascinating and instructive.'"
CPE_35,"**Tim Rice's Introduction to Andrew Lloyd Webber**

I was invited into a young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space amidst a chaotic house. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like upgrading from economy to business class. This room held the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and surprising items like Georgian wine glasses and furniture. The young man was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and had nine months before starting. During this time, he aimed to become England's answer to composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were equally ambitiousâ€”I wanted to be a pop star for the fame, money, and women. Unlike Andrew, my dreams weren't life or death, though they might have been if I had failed.

When Andrew suggested I try to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. Within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three of his compositions on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. He played selections from shows he had written at school, reminding me of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded. We agreed to meet again and write something together. Although I was more interested in pop charts than West End theatre, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination. I didn't want to miss the chance to work with someone who could take the musical theatre by storm.

The next day, back at my desk where I was training to become a solicitor, my certainty about a life in show business with Andrew faded. I continued to look for groups needing a vocalist and wrote simple songs that suited my voice. It seemed likely I would eventually become a lawyer, as my father predicted. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was fascinating, talking about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and supporting Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by his idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a philanthropist who founded orphanages. The story seemed too clean and unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was infectious. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar, there's room for two. We could be the second one.

I started working with enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew outlined the plot, played the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which his previous lyricist had thought up. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be ill, to write my first theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have an amazing ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy through language. Language is so integral to human life that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you find two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This suggests that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning wasn't invented by a clever spider and doesn't rely on education or a talent for building.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can greatly shape the look of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions all year support the growth of tropical jungles, which are rich in species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas can only support a few living things. Daily weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the air, being light, doesn't move as fast as the spinning Earth. However, the sun is a more significant cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning more than I ever wanted to about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee wasn't as easy as it seemed, and I expected to be demoted to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get the hang of it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture seem perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully capture both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a reliable critic with a captivating personality, and he had nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often overlooked by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but it instead explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, one can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which aligns well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed the market would control the price of scarce metals have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are decreasing. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate allegations against a multinational company benefiting from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are plenty of ferries and water-taxis, or you can rent a boat to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a reason. Its calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. On land, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle at night."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**

The Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a unique experience: a weekend course where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the only bamboo bike-building course in the UK. The atmosphere is lively and fun, quite different from a typical woodwork class.

Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, these bikes can be expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or Â£1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable and spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell frames.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so they run the club alongside their full-time jobs. Their courses are reasonably priced and include a computer-designed custom bike frame and a fun weekend of bike-building.

For someone like me, who isn't great at DIY, the quality of the bike was a concern. On the first day, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and form strong joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes together to form the bike's frame, with alloy tubes used for parts that need extra strength. The instructors are always there to help if needed.

Most participants enjoy the challenge of building their own bike, and many are engineers. But even if you make mistakes, it's easy to fix them with another piece of bamboo. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, and you can choose from different styles like plain, black, or mottled bamboo.

On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. After a final waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian and James have tested their bikes extensively, and they hold up well.

While bamboo bikes might look a bit rough compared to professional frames, they have a unique charm. I prefer a relaxed style for leisurely rides, so I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making for a comfortable ride.

James believes the real joy comes when the bike is on the road. They are light, effortless, and fun to ride. And the best part? The cost is less than Â£500."
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she discovered a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she recalls, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on communication between the sexes is a key part of the growing self-help industry, which claims to address Americans' desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is filling shelves with books that are as exaggerated as their covers. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar or too niche. Editors focus on marketability, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Reverend admits, ""A catchy title is two-thirds of the battle. It helps you reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may avoid sharing shameful actions or thoughts, or they might leave out details they consider unimportant. Some writers believe that inventing stories can better capture the truth about themselves than sticking strictly to facts. Others might label their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without cynicism.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories have been seen as reflecting the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. They are allegories where crime represents human impulses like lust or greed, and solving the crime restores order. In Hammett's stories, society is restored but shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other, sharing traits. The private eye is both a crook and a competitor, caught between law and crime. His mission is complicated by his connection to both sides.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was promoting his new book. Gould believes that understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. In science, only those who are part of the community can effectively present it. He advises never to write down to the reader. ""Simplify the language but not the argument,"" he says. ""Once readers feel patronized, your piece is dead."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, the air feels cold. To combat this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quieter times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It symbolizes our ability to control or change the climate. However, many buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls to absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple measures could greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It's not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials. These instruments measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became garden ornamentsâ€”romantic but outdated in a modern age. Now, they are gaining attention again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm is in their connection to the planets. He describes a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show where serious, grey-haired women painted teacups with delicate flowers. Each brushstroke was perfect, forming petals or leaves. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed they had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered who would join a china-painting course. Would beginners show natural artistry? In reality, the atmosphere was relaxed. The students were there to have fun, and even the tutor didn't want to paint petals on teacups with the speed I had seen before."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent mentioned that the other travelers were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Due to a mistake at the travel agency, check-in desk, or a computer error, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland at the Edelweiss Hotel, Room 212.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She confirmed their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with Northern England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

Upon arrival, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith assumed it was part of the plan. Tired and dirty from travel, they accepted the beds offered to them. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the entire holiday and became worried.

The receptionist explained they could enjoy the lake and take a steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly told him there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help.

Mrs. Franks, the woman from the plane, approached them. Dawne asked if she was in charge and explained they were in the wrong hotel. Keith added that they followed the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl at Gatwick. Mrs. Franks explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and it was easy to follow the wrong group.

Keith insisted they weren't meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she'd check and left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened.

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted Keith's thoughts, saying they had a great night's sleep. Dawne politely responded. Keith and Dawne left the reception area, not mentioning the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a tour with elderly people, which was the opposite of what they wanted. Uncle had insisted they needed a break from the demands of the elderly."
CPE_48,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**

American executives are now looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. In Britain, most people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are enthusiastically catching up. Biographies and accounts of the Endurance voyage are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his adventures with admiration, drawing lessons in leadership and communication. They even refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton.' The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises,' such as when a company's plant explodes or when half the workforce must be laid off.

MacGregor explains that Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton had his values in order and was at his best when he and his team had much to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most fascinating decisions was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole during his 1908 expedition. This decision showed his credibility for future expeditions: the lives of his men were most important.

In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. While today's managers often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it on. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Shackleton told his men they would reach safety if they continued to do their best and trusted him. From their accounts and diaries, it's clear Shackleton was always in charge. He planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions. He was adaptable and willing to start fresh when needed.

Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that in desperate situations, doing nothing can be the hardest thing, especially in America, where people are eager to act quickly. For example, if you buy bonds and guess wrong on interest rates, holding on can eventually recover your money. Similarly, don't be afraid to change plans if they're not working. If a new product fails, stop selling it.

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, was without gloves. He insisted Hurley take his own gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he refused. Someone else recalled Shackleton doing the same with a biscuit during the 1905 expedition when they were near starving. Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says the public's appetite for heroic endeavors is growing. Shackleton stands out as a genuine embodiment of the ideals we long for today."
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that has a lifestyle similar to a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by making holes in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue, while the aye-aye uses its sharp teeth and long, thin third finger. Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently discovered how it finds insects inside the wood.

Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some captive aye-ayes. He tested if they found insects by looking for visual signs, like holes on the wood surface. He gave them logs with drilled holes, some leading to mealworms and others to empty spaces. The aye-ayes went directly to the mealworms, showing they didn't rely on visual clues. Further tests showed they didn't use smell or sound either, as they found mealworms even when the smell was blocked and the insects were dead.

Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes could sense empty cavities as well as those with mealworms. They tap the wood with their middle finger and use their large ears to listen for echoes that indicate a hollow space. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping. The idea that aye-ayes take the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting, but there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood. The aye-aye is unique because it combines traits of a woodpecker, an echo-locating bat, and a squirrel. Its teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells to eat the nut inside."
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us small glimpses, and family stories are often incomplete. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still just images. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary lives. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy the process."" The promise of confidentiality helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" He did it for his family, hoping they might learn something, but hasn't let his children read it yet. He prefers they read it after he is gone. He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things parents say can affect their children for life. People often marry someone their parents would approve of, or the opposite as a rebellion."" Many people still feel disappointed about unresolved issues with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some seek permission to express their true feelings. Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an interrogator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes share things and then doubt if it should be included. I include it anyway, and they can remove it later if they want. But generally, people want to be honest."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not about having an interesting life that the world needs to know about. Things are changing fast, and we are losing touch with the past. This is a way to connect with our ancestors because families don't gather as they used to. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing and interpreting the events. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with gold lettering. You can choose your own cover color and title. These books are fascinating to the private audience they are meant for and are not about revealing secrets at any cost. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well, so the final product is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly Â£3,000, with extra copies at Â£25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, like readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world with a collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, featuring over six hundred pieces. It's important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with excellent natural lighting. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can view nearly all the most famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, and it is a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates, an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining brasses are in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Paternity**

**A. The Theatre Director**

Due to my unusual personal life, I've had 35 years of raising young children, and I've loved every moment. This morning, I fed the baby, and to me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I've become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I've slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I've always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you create a burden of guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion. This has been invaluable for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy establishing my business, so I missed some events like first concerts and sports days. I'm sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and join us at parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling intimidated. I think it's an advantage that I work in a field they find glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others followed quickly. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a real issue. I insist on only accepting weekend meetings and public appearances where my kids can come with me. This way, they understand what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of me disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we're all becoming more aware of the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think more about fatherhood. I made great efforts to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other so they could come and go freely, but Kate and Bonnie found it confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently complained that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more structure. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach, which I regret now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you're also just one more parent in a long line. It's a great equalizer. I sometimes resent it, but any irritation disappears with just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest way to melt a grown man."

**A. Tamburlaine the Great**  
Marlowe's ten-act epic about the unstoppable warrior can feel endless, but in Terry Hands' production, it becomes one of the most exciting performances of the year. He has cut large parts of the text, creating a show that combines Marlowe's brilliance with fast-paced action. Antony Sher shines in the lead role, performing stunts like somersaulting from the balcony and sliding down a rope while speaking. His intense performance captivates the audience with his character's thirst for power and glory. A must-see.

CAE_46,"Text: 'Science Defying Gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their theories in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707. However, appearances were misleading, and the 13 students from Europe and America were about to experience an extraordinary flight. Inside, the plane was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat. For a year, they had competed with other students to join this flight, a challenge by the European Space Agency to propose creative experiments in weightless conditions. The best ideas earned a spot on this unique flight, described as an extraordinary roller-coaster ride. For two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, soaring upwards and then diving towards Earth. The goal was to achieve weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued upward by momentum before gravity pulled it down again. In those brief moments between climbing and falling, everything inside became weightless, and the students felt closer to the moon than Earth. The takeoff was smooth, but any illusion of a normal flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin. Then the engines cut, and weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step sent us towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; directions lost meaning. Gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand movement. After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity's return was less sudden than its loss, but still abrupt enough to make some students land with a thud. With the first curve done, some turned green at the thought of 29 more. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to learn how cats always land on their feet. They released it, floating belly-up, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. The next curve nearly ended the experiment when another student landed on it during a rough return to gravity. Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by the lack of gravity, considering future space station construction. A team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet light. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity, believing that perfected solar sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind. After two hours of swinging between sky and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was exhilaration, not nausea. This was an experience that would stay with us. 'It was unforgettable,' said one student. 'I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more.''"
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique period in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had the idea of buying a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you can take the time and effort to plant it with trees, then you can have it."" The idea was for us to always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very fertile, but it was good for planting trees.

I've always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees appealed to me, and I was eager to start. The rest of the family became enthusiastic as we progressed. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those winters with a lot of rain. It rained almost every day we were planting, and I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for another day of planting. Coming out of the Land Rover warm and dry, with rain falling, and your jacket still damp from the day before, boots soaked, hands struggling with wet laces. The mind starts to wander, allowing for all sorts of thoughts and reflections about life.

In that first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it empties. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles across a long distance, and those poles guide your lines. Once aligned, you plant along the line, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig the hole. This rhythm is common in many agricultural jobs, where you train your body to perform standard moves, making the process easy: taking the tree from the bag, digging a hole, planting it, stamping it in, and moving on.

Mentally, it's fascinating. The mind starts to wander, allowing for thoughts and reflections about life. Many of my ideas about the natural world and our place in it began during those days. I've returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying when you planted them and have a stake in their success. I always worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand. However, it turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I took a term off from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months alone. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There's a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. The connection between me and that area is still very strong. It's the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" I thought as a helper handed me a cardboard box. Since my husband Derek and I turned our Somerset dairy farm into an ""open farm"" six years ago, we've become known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the boxâ€”a mix between a cackle and a barkâ€”was unfamiliar. Inside, I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their velvet-like coats (which later revealed fleas) and milky eyes looked up from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they often die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by builders who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I placed them by the stove in the farmhouse kitchen for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially, I fed them with a syringe, wiping them with a warm cloth first to mimic their mother's licking, which helped them relieve themselves. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum,"" they seemed content.

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, though still eating. It was a warning sign I missed. The next morning, I found him dead. A vet's post-mortem revealed a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's crucial not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. Disheartened, I continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. The area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. Willow II joined us. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother left him. He was difficult to feed. I had to move the bottle's teat around and squeeze it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were weaned onto creamed rice and then anything. Willow was different. He gave up the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods.

At nearly five months old, they were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my foundlings became nocturnal, walking only at dusk or night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined less often, didn't and sometimes reacted colorfully to being caught. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They likely extended their territories to find food, as badgers are territorial and can kill intruders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal for protection. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response led us to start an appeal to build a sett on the farm. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walk direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing from a darkened enclosure. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they preferred the sett's excitement over walks. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to find them asleep in their chambers. These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they're not fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose occasionally (she joined a neighboring sett), but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they've accepted."

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, his significant achievement was mapping the 'variations of the compass,' now called 'declination.' Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't accurately navigate the oceans. Halley, one of the few scientists paid to do research at the time, set out to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip to the Cape Verde Islands was cut short due to crew issues, but he tried again. This second voyage took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, Halley published a chart showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart was crucial for sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it outdated.

Dr. Clark, an enthusiastic sailor, wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise Â£70,000 for the trip, with support from Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. Halley was not only an astronomer but also a geophysicist and an expedition leader. He mapped stars and advised Sir Isaac Newton on the Principia Mathematica, a key work in classical physics. Halley also invented a diving bell.

Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will honor Halley's legacy. The expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore,' will have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's, but with more accurate tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. Dr. Clark explains that measuring the magnetic field's direction requires knowing true north, which they can determine using global positioning satellites. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the expedition. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.

Halley's journey was the first scientific sea expedition, and he was the first civilian naval captain focused on declination. Dr. Clark has the experience needed for this voyage, having spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. The expedition will be completed in four stages with different crews. Dr. Clark is committed to the project, saying, 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**Power Dressing Every Summer**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, how did such extravagant features evolve? Darwin believed that evolution happened through natural selection, where the fittest individuals survive and reproduce. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection'. He thought females might choose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most attractive males, there must be a reason beyond just beauty. Wallace thought the tail might signal some hidden quality that helped survival. Today, this debate continues because studying peafowl behavior is challenging. However, the 200 peacocks at Whipsnade, who live like wild birds but are used to humans, provide a unique chance to study this.

Marion Petrie and her team at Whipsnade are exploring two main questions. First, do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? Second, do these males have other advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it just about looks, as Darwin thought? Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. These males attract more mates. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be healthier and free of parasites, which their plumage could indicate. While this is true for some birds, Petrie's team hasn't been able to test this in Whipsnade peacocks. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier. If so, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

There's another theory by R.A. Fisher called 'Fisher's Runaway'. It suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their offspring will inherit these traits. Over generations, this preference could lead to increasingly extravagant tails. This theory supports Darwin's idea that females might select 'beauty for beauty's sake' once the process starts."
CAE_66,"Text: 'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should mix old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with the latest technology. Most of these yachts are based on a design change from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly moored on a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. You might think its owner is a romantic dreamer. Maybe I am, but I doubt it. This boat uses the charm of old boat design, but modern technology made it easier to build. However, while technology is essential in today's boat design and building, it often shields sailors from the real challenges of sea life. These challenges are often what sailors want to experience. I'm not saying sailors should suffer all hardships. I always make sure my boats have a coal stove for warmth and dry sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Sometimes, dealing with sails is part of a sailor's life. And why should we move steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a risky spot near the front? Sadly, this is done to create a cabin like a luxury liner, with a bed bigger than at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating house. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the former owner said it had every comfort but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned how right he was. Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I ever sailed. On land, though, old boats need a lot of care. After a back injury, I realized I had to end my 15-year relationship with her. I couldn't find a suitable new boat, so I decided to build one. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a napkin and later used a computer. After creating a design, he carved a model, like in the old days. We reviewed the model and made changes on the computer. The final design was perfect. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. She looks timeless, sails smoothly, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This is because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, not based on furniture. This traditional method works well. She shows that you don't need to follow trends to be satisfied and that history can teach us valuable lessons. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a classic.'"

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to review some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was excited to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm immediately. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff are friendly and professional, creating a lively atmosphere. Henlow plans to add a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or enjoy a walk in the garden. By the end of my stay, I felt energetic and happy. I look forward to visiting again. This is a great break for busy working women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I arrived. The Hall has a beautiful library and conservatory, and plenty of space for privacy. On arrival, everyone gets a medical check-up, which includes weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, they found a shoulder issue during my check-up, and the fitness instructor helped me with it. Each person follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting but had a headache on the second day. My meals included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and fruit with yoghurt for dinner. If you're not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious. You get a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are affordable.  
*Liz Gregory*

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a large lounge. If you're watching your weight, you might skip the gourmet food, which includes rich sauces and creamy desserts made by the French chef. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and pool to help burn off the calories. You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight. There are also spa facilities and a sports injury clinic. I received advice on an old shoulder injury, including exercises and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, and you can explore the beautiful countryside nearby.  
*Beverly D'Silva*

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, and horse riding. The estate has beautiful woodland walks and gardens. Waldo's, the restaurant, is famous for its delicious dishes. The menu is extensive, and the food is excellent, especially the sticky-toffee pudding. After a great meal, I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments and beauty treatments if you want them, but you can also just enjoy the food at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's delicious, but the worst because it's high in calories if you're trying to lose weight. The aromatherapy massage is also fantastic. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage, then had a great night's sleep. The modern facilities are well-run, with many therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, and the guests include everyone from football teams to families and friends. I would love to visit here once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans split from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically; we're still over 98% identical to chimps. On an evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is a recent development. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other uniquely human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This means that the differences between us and animals are mostly matters of degree.

For example, both humans and animals use tools. Wild chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have a simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it's interesting that our ancestors didn't create art for most of the time since they diverged from chimps. The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these wouldn't have survived over time. Clear evidence of human art appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we claim that our recent creativity sets us apart, we need to consider how our art differs from animal creations. Three main distinctions are often suggested: human art is non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art can communicate ideas, it's not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, helps defend territory or attract mates, directly aiding in gene transmission. By this measure, human art is different.

The second claim is that only human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting it's not just for pleasure. Again, human art seems unique here.

The third distinction is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned, not genetically inherited. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's music. In contrast, some birds inherit their species' song and would sing it even without hearing it. It's like a French baby raised in Japan spontaneously singing the French national anthem.

The role of learning in human art is also evident in how quickly styles change. Geese honked 2,000 years ago as they do today, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum-goers can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day for his own satisfaction and was upset when his pencil was taken away. In 1957, their paintings were shown at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and most were sold, a feat many human artists can't claim.

These ape paintings blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they had no utilitarian purpose and were made for the painter's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it's often intended to communicate. However, some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction, not communication."
CAE_39,"**An Exciting Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth and also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to feature brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes narrowed from looking into far horizons on their journeys into the unknown. These days, such people are rare in fiction and even rarer in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but locals call it the Desert of Death. He recalled the dangers and excitement of that amazing trek in the calm atmosphere of his family home. The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered their lives and the expedition's success.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least hospitable desert, and Charles Blackmore has written a fascinating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He launched the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I had always assumed I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered promotion but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a tremendous gamble. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the event, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word 'kind'. The team suffered severe hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our own endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never hit the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally immobilized us. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against hurdles the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily laden camels, which often rolled over onto us.'

'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental stamina for the trip but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert and it was such an inferno that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment I was a very scared man.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and sinewy despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How conscious was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that measure, the desert does not compare.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were buoyed up by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.'"
CAE_18,"Susan Harr felt overwhelmed by technology, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and rediscover the joys of doing things by hand. While technology offers many gadgets that make life easier, Susan realized that it also comes with hidden costs and dependencies. A recent issue with her word processor, which was expensive to fix, made her question whether these gadgets are worth the trouble.

Gradually, Susan let her household gadgets go as they broke down. She began to wonder what kind of ""time"" technology really gives us. Is it just more time to buy and use more gadgets? She felt that marketing experts might be misleading us. When her sewing machine started making strange noises, she decided to abandon it and sew by hand instead. This allowed her to enjoy the process without being tied to a noisy machine.

There are some gadgets Susan still values, like the washing machine, but she found unexpected joy in letting go of others. For example, she returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change encouraged her family to spend more time walking the dog, reading, and talking.

Sewing by hand became a new hobby for Susan. She found it relaxing and satisfying, allowing her to listen to the radio or talk with family while working. It also helped her slow down and enjoy life at her own pace. She realized that she didn't need to rush from one activity to another.

Susan also rediscovered the simple pleasure of washing dishes by hand, which gave her time to daydream. Now, she looks around her house and questions whether they really need certain gadgets like the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. She even considers the idea of saving money by doing without electric lights."
CAE_62,"Text: 'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man in a hurry. When I arrive at his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, 'Well, fire away then!' It's not clear if his abruptness is genuine or if he's just shy. However, his busy workshop, filled with half-made furniture and planks of wood in various natural colors, shows he has no time to waste. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a strong reputation. His order book is always full months in advance, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if you want a well-made cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen unit, Hurst is the person to see. Finding a furniture-maker isn't hard, especially in the countryside where the craft is thriving. But finding one who focuses on beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines is more challenging. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says with a sigh. As a craftsman with high standards, he is often disappointed by modern furniture. 'I'm amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people accept.' He criticizes poorly made, mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who produce low-quality pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are key to his success. Hurst is confident in his abilities. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says seriously. 'I've always been good at making things.' If not for his self-deprecating tone at the end of our interview, I might have thought his confidence was entirely genuine. Hurst is self-taught. How did he learn his craft? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says casually. Most of his work comes from private clients. 'I used to do some commercial work for companies, but it was soul-destroying.' Some clients return repeatedly. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he admits that client relationships aren't always smooth. 'The most frustrating clients are those who don't know what they want and then decide when it's too late... my favorite clients are the demanding ones.' While Hurst has reasons to be proud, he also praises others when deserved. With a touch of modesty, he says, 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (a top furniture design college). However, he criticizes craftsmen who 'try to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also dislikes degree shows where students display their work while 'trying to make fashion statements. That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture should be something people can really use.' Hurst is confident and sometimes abrupt, but neither he nor his work is pretentious. His final comment shows a practical approach to his craft and a hint of humility that contrasts with his earlier confidence. 'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says as I leave.'"

It says we sleep to keep our bodies healthy. While we sleep, our bodies repair damage from the day and restore full efficiency. Another theory focuses on the learning benefits of sleep. It suggests that sleep helps us process information we learn during the day, and without sleep, learning would not happen. A third theory is about energy. It says we need sleep to recharge our energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**Eccentrics**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who doesn't follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own quirks, like entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about everything. Eccentricity is about showing our uniqueness. Inside us, there is a constant struggle between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, the desire to fit in is stronger. We want to be accepted and loved, more than we want to stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. We might say things like, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me,"" to show our individuality.

At any time, we can choose to be more individualistic. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said that when you follow your gut and don't give up, you might confuse people. But this self-assertion isn't eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to get noticed, that's not eccentricity. However, if they keep doing these things until they can't go back to 'normal' behavior, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is being natural. Eccentrics don't try to be odd; they just are. They don't care about public opinion and are barely aware of it. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all very aware of society. Eccentrics simply do what they do because of who they are, without worrying about the world around them."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four leading naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've had the privilege of meeting some of the pioneers in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe and developed a compelling philosophy from her experiences. As a young journalist, her work helped me understand the field. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title even in 1976, is her most important book to me. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the themes she dedicated her life to, like sustainable development. I've read hundreds of books since, but none match its impact.

**B Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can vividly imagine the sounds and smells of a herring gull colony. This book brilliantly explains animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos to an efficient social structure. You can identify partners, boundaries, and families. Niko Tinbergen was a distinguished behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with wildlife artist Eric Ennion was inspirational. Ennion's spontaneous painting style, developed from years of observing birds, captures the essence of their behavior with minimal lines and color. This is the work of a true field naturalist.

**C Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell has had the greatest influence on my life. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This extraordinary book solidified my devotion to the natural world. I first read it while researching animal vocalizations in Madagascar. Despite setbacks, reading this book made my world brighter. It weaves animals, people, joy, and beauty together, showing a world worth saving. Many criticize our species for harming others, but Gerald's view of the world as a family, with all its members intertwined, is a concept we need to understand.

**D Bruce Pearson**

I discovered ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after its 1966 publication. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. These images captured my attention and encouraged me to start sketching birds to aid identification. The book offered more than just beautiful paintings; it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This broad range of information and exciting images led me to appreciate birds and nature more generally. It showed me that an emotional and creative response to nature is as valid as a scientific one. As art was my stronger subject, this book opened a new path for me."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five leading British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are crucial for publishers; they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually less upset by bad reviews. They believe that any attention, whether good or bad, can boost sales as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but their needs differ. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviewing is more diverse and less elitist than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are still often overlooked. Publishers shouldn't complain too much, as reviews are a cost-effective way to promote books. A lively review by a trusted critic can increase sales, especially if there are multiple reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are vital for literary publishing. We rely on them because our books are not by famous authors and we rarely advertise. Positive reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Good reviews can boost sales significantly, but they need to be combined with other factors like word-of-mouth, support from bookstores, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The link between publishing and reviewing in Britain is unclear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can greatly impact a book's success. In Britain, bookshops often ignore reviews. It can take years of good reviews for a writer to gain readers, while poorly reviewed books can still sell well. The process is unpredictable, though non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for positive reviews, but do they sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, yet it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to read the book after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the unexpected choice of reviewer or the quality of the review that can drive sales."

He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs tailored to his customers' needs. 'This way, I can make a personalized item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want something special that reflects the man's work or hobbies.' This is quite different from the traditional cockerel design. Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick, made as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends admired it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I realized there are endless possibilities for designs,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, switched rolesâ€”she worked as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for their children and build the business. That was five years ago, and he has no regrets. 'My previous job lacked creativity, but this is exciting and artistic,' he says. 'I love the design aspect.' Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He works with great detail, always getting customer approval before cutting. He also keeps traditional designs in stock, as they are popular. 'People like handcrafted items,' Graham says. 'They enjoy having something unique.' Graham has no plans to expand, wanting to keep the business a rural craft. 'I have found my niche. People appreciate individuality, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand weather changes by showing wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want unique touches for their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is busy supplying flat-packed weathervanes worldwide, with interest from American and Danish buyers. 'Pricing depends on the design's complexity,' he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift.'"

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans earned him record-breaking amounts of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. His year began poorly when a film project called *Life and Limb*, which he had been working on for months, suddenly fell apart. This was a big disappointment and a source of worry for him. It had been two years since he last earned any money, and the film was his only hope to keep his bank manager at bay.

In a situation like this, a sensible person might have looked for a job. Evans could have returned to being a television executive or started a TV project he had put on hold. Instead, he made a bold decision that many, including himself, might have thought was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

Although this decision was impulsive, the idea for the story had been with him for a while. It was inspired by a farrier he met on Dartmoor, who told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were known as ""horse whisperers,"" and this story captured Evans' imagination.

Initially, Evans thought of writing a screenplay about it, as he was a filmmaker. However, after the disappointment with *Life and Limb*, he decided to write it as a book. So, in the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt very alone, and it seemed like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written the first half of the book. The bank manager was becoming increasingly demanding, and Evans needed to know if it was worth continuing. He gathered the courage to show the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance. Evans needed more than that to pay off some of his overdraft and support his family. He had already spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and needed at least two more months to finish it. $30,000 was a difficult amount to consider. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages of the novel, along with the synopsis, were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next became publishing history. Within a week, after intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were in shock. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief.""

The studios agreed to this amount, and they each made their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four major filmmakers called, one after the other, to bid for the rights to his unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He planned to be involved, but from a distance. The success of his novel also brought new offers to back *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for young people. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer has returned to chess to play against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, simple yet deep. However, as the following games have shown, this older, bearded player is not the same as he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer's own influence helped make chess more professional. Now, the focus is more on winning than on the scientific and artistic aspects of the game. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intellect and wisdom. The game has always been intense: a chess clock ensures each player makes the required moves in the given time, or they lose the game. Now, games are longer, and many are played without breaks. This increased pressure benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. It's not just how the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess happens off the board, not just in the psychological battles Fischer is known for. Every professional must prepare seriously before a match, especially because computer databases have changed chess. A small computer can hold a million chess games and provide instant access to an opponent's past games. In a recent match, both players had large teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now analyzed in great detail. Being better prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours. For a chess master, this is a constant struggle. A moment of lost focus can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the tension. The end of the game often involves a frantic 'time scramble'. In these moments, each player has only seconds to make several moves or lose the game. With minds racing and hands moving quickly, the masters make their moves and press their clocks with coordination that any athlete would admire. These moments are not for deep thinkers. The game becomes a basic struggle where nerves, determination, and a strong will to win decide the winner. At the top level, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress and tiredness. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready to compete the next day. Most chess tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even tougher. The 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about two stone (10kg) in weight. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his departure from chess after 1972 seem even more puzzling. But in some ways, it was a fitting end to his story. It made Bobby Fischer a legend. If he has returned for the money, he will do well. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer has come back truly believing he can prove he is still the best, the final result could be very disappointing.'"

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is a playwright with three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a screenplay. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over Â£30 million, but it could be as low as Â£30."" Interestingly, before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he admits. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because of the logistical issues. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very stimulating.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has progressed significantly since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comic team Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""He saw my show, and as I was a huge fan of his, he probably saw me mimicking him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became known when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The critical response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great showcase for me,"" he says. ""I can now choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was destined for success. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But I decided to pursue it because I had a knack and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for recognition but is thoughtful about fame. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize it's not about that. It's about getting respect for good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They're talking about a smash hit, but I have no idea. If two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix."" It happened at the perfect time. ""There were times I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes and awards than many twice his age. He is well-known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became disenchanted with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving critical acclaim, moving into novels is brave. ""There's a framework with poetry and less chance to do something wrong,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for mistakes. My main goal is not to produce work without caring about quality."""
CAE_1,"**A.** Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romances. She thinks she looks good in jeans but avoids wearing them to not attract the wrong crowd. Isabel is searching for Mr. Right but worries her knobbly knees might be a problem. Despite her concerns, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'

**B.** This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio.

**C.** In this story, it's normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. So, when successful professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he naturally talks to his wife's ex. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she also wants his help for her brother, who is wrongly imprisoned. However, the real interest lies in how the author cleverly resolves these issues. The plot is moved along with humor and a keen look at relationships, making it a sophisticated and witty read.

**D.** Two pairs of best friendsâ€”two women and two menâ€”meet in 1960s London and remain connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, the mysterious American businessman James Hudson, is launching a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book is large and detailed, allowing readers to really get to know the characters.

**E.** Written by a top American fiction writer, this funny and heartfelt story is about Ian Bedloe, who, feeling guilty for a past mistake, becomes the 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor, surrounded by the chaos of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the touching relationship Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It's a warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. Volunteers, especially during gap years, may help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could fund more labor than the volunteer provides. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is truly altruistic or if it's more about gaining 'cultural capital' for career benefits. However, these projects might help volunteers develop a lifelong commitment to ethical actions that support less privileged communities.

**B.** Volunteering can foster international understanding, conflict resolution skills, and global participation through civic organizations. It can also create international social networks. Ideally, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly accessible to people from wealthier regions, it may primarily benefit these individuals, offering them career advantages while doing little for communities without access to such opportunities. Volunteers might use these experiences as a step towards personal advancement.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as imperialistic or self-serving, focused on personal and career growth for affluent Westerners. At its best, it benefits both volunteers and host organizations, allowing for the exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to addressing power imbalances, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of life strategies aimed at helping others. These strategies, focused on 'making a difference,' can seem appealing in an anti-political climate. They avoid big government and business but also bypass democratic processes, reducing development to individual charity acts. While volunteer tourism can be simple charity, when marketed as sustainable development, it may degrade the development discourse. This approach can shift focus away from understanding global inequalities and poverty."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us use a radio to wake up in the morning, often needing an external push to get out of bed. Enter the clock radio. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The first model's ""dual alarm function"" isn't what I expected. It doesn't let you snooze with a buzzer and then wake up later. Instead, it allows setting two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and another for weekends. But who lives by such a strict schedule? This model, priced similarly to the second one we tested, includes a cassette player, which is a great deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We all agreed the radio quality was excellent, though the size was a downsideâ€”it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges noted, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. Plus, I always book a wake-up call just in case.""

This model was the most attractive and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" although the clock on his test model ""kept getting stuck at 16.00."" I was impressed by the digital display with its grey numbers on a green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to tap with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons, like pebbles, tempted me to play with them, which was a problem when I finally looked at the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't need to reset it if someone unplugs it for a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner, which we all appreciated. However, setting it up was technically challenging, though mastering it made us feel ""cool"" and sophisticated.

Tom Granger found the model with an extra built-in lamp ""unbelievably tacky."" ""You have to yank the light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality of the rest of it."" He had to read the instructions twice to get it working; the clock kept jumping from 12.00 to 02.00. The light was hard to position and only shone on the clock, which was already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer was like a submarine alarm, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people with its bright colors and bootlace strap, this model appealed to Tom Granger and me. ""I would choose this one because it stands out,"" he said. The traditional controls made it the only one we set up without the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a 20-minute margin for error; the manual says, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time."" Paul Bridges dismissed this, calling it ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless.""

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger for being ""standard and compact,"" and for its old-fashioned dial tuning. ""It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed everything correctly, so you can't trust it to work."" He admitted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality due to button-tuning. I found the tuning crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model was effective; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Text: 'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, making their spines point outwards. The success of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to be lighter, so they have fewer spines and might try to run from attackers, using their ball-rolling ability only if necessary. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, either under bushes or in holes. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; in good conditions, some stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in sports is challenging for everyone, but women often face additional hurdles. Training and competitions demand sacrifices, leaving little time for a normal life. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming obstacles and setting new records. Here, we talk to a few remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**

""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land smoothly, but it can be frightening. Sometimes you feel unwell or it's windy and visibility is poor, but you just push through. It's hard to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You sacrifice a lot of your social life and friendships. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equallyâ€”it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**

""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was surprising since I'd never cycled before! I'm well-paid as a professional, and cycling offers many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I've succeeded because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling rather than earning money. I train at least four hours daily on the bike, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitmentâ€”it would be impossible otherwise.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**

""Rowing is tough for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most don't begin until they're 19 or 20, making it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches often stay for only a year, so there's no continuity, and the women's squad is disorganized. But it's great fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**

""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the worldâ€”I didn't realize how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was headstrong and disliked anyone controlling me. Now I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience I've had. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours daily with three hours of sleep, in high temperatures, and with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, as my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Men often think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as riskier.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**

""Some men have big egos when drivingâ€”you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has disadvantages. At corners, men think 'I've got to beat her,' so I've had many collisions! You need to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's tough to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have raced since the twenties and were seen as eccentric. It's great that more women are racing each year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is striving for perfectionâ€”always trying for a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**

""I get up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous anticipation before races, and you really push yourself during themâ€”you don't feel good if you don't. I've often asked myself why I do it. The answers are: a) I'm happier when I'm fit, b) I'm naturally lazy and would be a slob if I didn't push myself, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the press, 90% of the article focuses on the men's event, with only 10% mentioning the women's event. The prize money isn't as good either. But we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it."""
CAE_34,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso

Richard Cork shares his experience of meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was an 18-year-old student. While traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van, Richard ran out of money and took a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, he saw Picasso having lunch at a restaurant in the harbor. Picasso was known to be a private person, so Richard was surprised to see him there with his wife, Jacqueline, and friends.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard approached Picasso to ask for his autograph. To his surprise, Picasso not only signed his sketchbook but also added a lively drawing. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, though they needed an American woman at the table to translate between English and French.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was encouraged to return and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, Richard began sketching. Picasso noticed and playfully made faces, making it difficult for Richard to draw. Eventually, Picasso settled down, allowing Richard to capture his likeness. Richard observed Picasso's youthful appearance and intense eyes, despite his age.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and then decided to draw Richard in return. In a few quick strokes, Picasso created a whimsical version of Richard's face, moving one eye onto his nose and capturing his smile with a single line.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt incredibly fortunate to have met Picasso and received his attention, which meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Encourage You to Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here, we explore the strategies shops use to encourage spending.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. To create this impression, they often place fruits, vegetables, or even house plants at the store entrance. An in-store bakery might spread the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's color scheme, like using green, can also enhance this fresh image. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't fit this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With computerized stock control, supermarkets know which areas attract the most shoppers. High-profit items or fast-selling products are placed in these spots. The saying ""eye-level is buy-level"" means that shelves at eye height are prime locations for products. Special offers in ""dump bins"" attract bargain hunters. Another tactic is ""complementation,"" where related items, like salad dressings and salads, are placed together.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place essential items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to pass by other tempting, higher-profit products. Similarly, chain stores might place popular items far from the entrance, relying on customer loyalty to lead shoppers through the store, exposing them to other products.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from the ""pile them high, sell them cheap"" model. Instead, they display fewer items, creating a boutique feel and making the products seem exclusive. This success is due to both good store design and appealing clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total bill rather than individual prices. Supermarkets use this by offering a mix of low and high mark-up items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. Some items, known as ""loss leaders,"" are sold at a loss to attract customers. More often, low prices come from buying in bulk or meeting sales targets, which earn discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. Pricing a blouse at Â£14.99 instead of Â£15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as staff must process the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for natural lighting to show clothes' true colors. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to make fresh produce look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**

Some chain stores use different carpeting to guide shoppers. One pattern marks the main routes, while another defines sales areas. This ""Yellow Brick Road"" approach isn't always successful, as some shoppers stick to the main paths. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for routes, encouraging shoppers to step onto the more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

As you enter a supermarket, large photos of delicious foods greet you, especially tempting if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" with screens that advertise products as you shop. Sensors trigger ads relevant to the section you're in, like ready-made meals near the cook-chill cabinets. These trolleys target impulse shoppers and reportedly boost sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Text: 'Mountaineer Chris Bonnington, known for climbing Everest in 1985, has also created new routes in Britain and the Alps and written books like Quest for Adventure. Robin Knox-Johnston started his sea career in the Merchant Navy and was the first to sail solo around the world in 1968-9. He also set a transatlantic record, sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, which they wrote about in their book Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979, while working on Quest for Adventure, I contacted Robin for an interview. He invited me to sail with him, where I could teach him climbing, and he could teach me sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed, anchored, and then went ashore to climb. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat. The climb was tough, but Robin was steady and calm. At one point, we reached a big drop. Robin had never climbed before, so I showed him how. He then asked to descend using his boat technique, which he did safely. This trip to Skye was the start of our friendship. Robin later suggested a joint trip to Greenland, combining our skills. Robin impressed me as a leader. He consulted everyone before making decisions, which was unusual for a skipper. Although I found sailing boring, Robin enjoyed it. He liked fixing things on the boat, while I felt a bit useless. The yacht was crowded with six people in a space meant for four. In Greenland, when it was my turn to lead, I found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety. Climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, was challenging. Robin wasn't a natural climber, but he was determined. Our first attempt took 24 hours, and we were exhausted. Robin trusted me completely, even when we had to turn back. Despite his worries about the boat, he supported trying the climb again. The only tension between us was on the way home. I missed a watch shift because Robin didn't wake me, thinking he could manage alone. I felt insecure, but Robin reassured me. By the end of the Greenland trip, I realized Robin was a kind and sensitive person beneath his tough exterior.'"
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been with us since ancient times, in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, the late 20th century risks losing this heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In Neolithic Britain, people spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and wrinkled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were very different from today's apples.

**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The dessert apple, Decio, was introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties didn't suit the British climate, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and develop new apples, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

Several apple types became popular in Britain in the 13th century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking partner was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the late 17th century, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a street fruit and vegetable seller. However, apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and created the first modern-style orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers brought them to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', was a famous apple planter. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was seen as a medicine man by the Indians, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious devotion inspired many folktales.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from a dead tree's roots. The apple was named 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples worldwide.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and worked as a midwife in New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith', she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, 'It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity (1950)**

Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than taste. This uniformity is reducing the variety and gene pool of apples. While UK gardeners have preserved many old varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now demanding more variety. We can't rely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity. We must value and protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a mountain track leads from a quiet road from Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the country's highest peak. This area, Nanyuki, has been my base for winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands for three years. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth trip. During this visit, I competed in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp, where top runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I couldn't miss. Training at high altitude increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, which has benefited many Kenyan runners. My first African race, held in Nairobi, was the continent's first international cross-country race. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, all but three of whom were Kenyan. Despite this, I felt I hadn't run poorly. I don't think Kenyan success is solely due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport, with an effortless running style, simple diet, and relaxed conversation. They also love competing. The least discussed aspect of their success is their training. My stay at the Kenyan team training camp provided answers. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mt Kenya, surrounded by playing fields and tropical vegetation. It's basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with regular students, six to a room in dormitories. Their days include three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six, with a briefing from coaches. ""Run easy, you have a hard job today,"" we were told. They cover about 40 kilometres daily, just short of a marathon. Sundays are easier, with only one 20-kilometre run. Life outside running is simple. A splash of water and brushing teeth are enough before breakfast, which includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar: ugali, stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to bathe in streams from Mt Kenya's glaciers. By the time I left, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It's not just genetics, upbringing, or altitude. I considered another explanation: the simple lifestyle, tough workouts, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard. The main issue is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers focus on mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become more fragmented. Even big brand campaigns should aim at smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Consider your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but only a few are advertised brands. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For consumer durables, maybe a dozen a year. Cars? If you have a new one, it's likely from your employer. If not, you buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with all the services and products you purchase, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare this to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more than Â£50,000 a year on advertising. The average person buys 400 of these, not all because of advertising. That's about 4%. So, the saying that half of advertising is wasted is an understatement; it might be 96%.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most, it's about 1 in 16 (6%), meaning 94% are wasted. You might think you're not influenced by advertising, but most people aren't. Waste is part of media advertising. Not everyone will buy the brands they see advertised. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the right audience, as advertisers can't predict who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with the masses. But all waste is unfortunate. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more potential buyers, but they can never know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail campaigns don't get a 100% response.

This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. With media, that's impossible. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media. This applies to all types of ads, from personal notices to soft drink commercials. An advertiser gaining one million new customers (2% of the adult population) is successful. For soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2% of the population is very successful, but that's still a small minority. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Solar Survivor Charles Clover explores Britain's most eco-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', created by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their home with waste heat from appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and blends with the town's nineteenth-century buildings. It was approved by planners even though it's in a conservation area. The solar-powered doorbell is silent, and the house is super-insulated with triple-glazed windows, making it very quiet inside. Once inside, you must remove your shoes, and there's a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Vale opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is well-sealed. Even the cats have an air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been committed to the environment since the 1970s, when they wrote a book on green architecture. They designed a building that emits no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water, which is filtered before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they avoid dishwashers to prevent using strong detergents. Most features are designed to be environmentally friendly. 'We wanted to show that you can design a house that is less harmful to the environment without living in darkness,' says Robert. The house's only medieval feature is its aesthetic: the hall, with a hearth and staircase, spans the building's full height. The Vales pay no water bills, and last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. Soon, solar panels will be installed, reducing electricity use further. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will generate a surplus. Eventually, there will be enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, rarely used. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room temperature was 18C, comfortable because there are no draughts or heat loss. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady was comfortable at 12.5C due to her clothing's insulation. Robert suggests people in old houses should live as they did in the past, though this idea may not catch on. The house is low-tech, with little to go wrong. Most materials came from a builder's merchant and were installed by local craftsmen, making it cheap to build, similar in cost to low-cost housing. Commercial builders are resisting this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a rational man, even a scientist. However, in 1920, when he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were scientific proof that these tiny creatures existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, recognizing fairies as supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick challenges a basic idea of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are familiar with computer software that lets us change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Text: 'Blacksmiths Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and those who work with it, blacksmiths, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they were the only ones who could make weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the intricate ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were always crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, these skills were nearly lost because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs. In the past 10 years, there has been a revival due to increased interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Still, much of the work seems outdated: makers of gates and balconies often describe their products as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy design stores are filled with rusty candlesticks with decorative bits. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmith's craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says: 'We might be entering a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.' Power tools have freed blacksmiths from hard labor, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld metal more easily. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.' About 250 pieces are on display, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at Â£90 and go into the thousands. Most of the money will go to the makers, 'but a percentage of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork,' says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. 'My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,' he says. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but becomes rigid and immovable when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans' steel door-knockers and handles seem inspired by the castles in horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And it feels like it will last forever.' No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. Iron is likely to be used decoratively for the next thousand years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks.'"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**

I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was really angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't explain how, in just one afternoon, I went from being a lifelong smoker to not smoking at all. It even surprises me. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to quit, and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groupsâ€”and I still am. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds faster than friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. ""I won't be trying to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair,"" I said. ""Since I'm here to write, not to quit, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me."" I thought I was being reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me pleasure. I noticed the counselor looked at me knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so filled with smoke that we had to open the windows. I found it interesting that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want toâ€”and neither did the others.

I guess the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to seem appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel powerful. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, like hunger, faded after a minute or two, and I only felt it for four or five days. The one thing I thought would be hardestâ€”working without cigarettesâ€”wasn't a problem at all. I believed I couldn't meet deadlines without nicotine and would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, spending weekend mornings at home was the hardest partâ€”and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was an activity itself. Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker needs to be facedâ€”eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theater break. These are key moments when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, has noticed that many people in Britain are unaware of Hodgkin's achievements. If Hodgkin had won a Nobel Prize in literature, she would likely be a household name. However, despite her remarkable life and contributions to science, she remains relatively obscure.

Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary individual. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, such as the progress of women's education and the globalisation of science. When Ferry began her research, she looked into scientific biographies and found that even Linus Pauling, a prominent chemist and Nobel laureate, was not well-represented in British bookstores. This reflects a broader issue where scientific biographies are often undervalued compared to those of artists or writers.

Some scientists themselves have doubted the appeal of scientific biographies. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once remarked that scientists' lives often make dull reading. This perception contributes to the lack of interest from publishers and booksellers. The idea that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists or politicians is unfounded. In fact, some scientists avoid media attention to maintain their credibility, which can create a false impression of science and deter young people from pursuing it.

Fortunately, this is changing. Scientists like Richard Dawkins and Steve Jones are appearing in public in new ways, helping to humanize the field. The publishing world is also evolving, with more engaging scientific biographies emerging. Richard Feynman's memoir, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", was a turning point, showing that scientists can have fascinating personal lives.

Dorothy Hodgkin's scientific achievements include solving the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She balanced her scientific work with a family life, having three children and a husband who was often away. Her ability to integrate her personal and professional life is inspiring.

While her personal life may not directly relate to her scientific work, it is part of what makes her story compelling. Understanding the passion that drives scientists like Hodgkin is challenging for biographers, as many readers lack the scientific background to fully grasp complex ideas. However, learning about scientific achievements is no more difficult than understanding literature or learning a new languageâ€”it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that many educated people remain unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. Recognizing her name and achievements should be as common as knowing distinguished literary or artistic figures."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is known for her special ability to find water using a forked hazel rod. This skill, often called a 'sixth sense', makes her popular among farmers whose wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business, using modern equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. Their success rate in finding water is over 90%.

Dowsing is the skill of finding water, minerals, or lost objects underground. There are many theories about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. A common theory is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Dowsers, like Margaret, might have a heightened ability to sense these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.

In recent drought years, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She also helps owners of remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where installing water pipes is too costly. Golf-course developers also seek her help for clubhouse facilities.

Margaret aims to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. She avoids drilling where farm waste might contaminate the water. The water she finds flows through cracks in solid rock, ensuring a clean supply. However, in Cornwall, where she works, there is a risk of finding iron-rich water. Electricity is needed to power the pump, so the well should be near existing power lines.

To find water on large properties like golf courses, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She moves the pendulum over the map, and it swings over areas with water. Then, she walks the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a peculiar sensation and uses the stick to pinpoint the exact spot to drill. Holding the stick's forks, she applies tension, and the stick rises when water is below. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates, as even a small mistake can miss the water. Her husband also checks the area, and they only drill when they agree on the spot.

Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition in England. Anthropologists and writers are intrigued by this mysterious intuition. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', which helps explain her accuracy in finding water. Without this 'sixth sense', her family couldn't sustain their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone for a day? Maybe you think it would be exciting to try something different. We arranged this for four people. Hereâ€™s what happened.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, a 30-year-old waitress at a busy London restaurant.

I had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. The atmosphere was amazing, but I wasn't sure I could handle it. Being a mother is busy, but this was something else! I had just 15 minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but I dropped the drinks, and they crashed to the floor. I was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.

By opening time at 11:30 am, there was already a queue outside, and I felt nervous. Remembering orders wasn't a problem because everything was automated. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn't get used to the loud music. I had to keep saying 'Pardon?' to customers, which was embarrassing. By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was exhausted and wanted to soak my feet. I couldn't believe it when a waitress said it had been a 'quiet' day!

I never realized how tiring waitressing could be. I thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be outgoing and handle lots of customers. I'm quite shy, and I don't think I could manage on a busy Saturday night. I wasn't impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me! I was glad to return to my children. It seems easier after waitressing!

**Cindy's Story**

I was nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was excited too. I was told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. I was wrong! After Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong again! Amanda left a note reminding me to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly! I thought they'd get tired, but they didn't. I thought I had stamina, but they beat me! I managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but then they kept asking for water to come downstairs and watch TV. It was exhausting negotiating with them all evening.

I never realized how tiring it could be to look after two small children. You don't get a moment for yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary, a 30-year-old primary school teacher.

On the farm, I get up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a luxury! I worried about what to wear. I couldn't show up in overalls and boots! At assembly, I faced about 400 pupils and hoped I blended in. After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, which was different from my school days when we recited tables together.

Then I helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was exhausted and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson. The children wanted to practice on me, which showed my rusty French. Finally, we had Physical Education. I was drained, but the children had endless energy.

The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Even for two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays, but I think I'll stick to farming!

**Hilary's Story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find Rosemary had been up for three hours! Her 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants.

I spent the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk, making ice cream, and labeling cartons. It was hard not to taste the goodies! At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I picked up a ewe that had fallen over. If left for more than 12 hours, they could die, so they need daily checks. What a nightmare in winter!

After feeding the calves, I started milking. It took two-and-a-half hours, and Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! I found it lonely and missed the children. Animals don't talk back! The worst part is not being able to get away from work. The cows need milking twice a day, so it's hard to plan time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is different. The income is irregular, and I'd hate to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player by the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he appears younger than his age, with a fresh and open manner, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a TV feature highlighted his work and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother found a teacher for him, the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who quickly recognized his talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher, who was passionate about the trumpet and connected with players worldwide. Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a primitive instrument with imperfections, and it's about understanding and working with them. From the start, he had the ability to find the right balance and develop his unique sound. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. His parents supported his ambition, and at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but during his first competition at 17, he realized he had a special gift for communication. Thibaud suggested entering the competition for experience. Hardenberger only prepared for the first round but advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized people listened to him despite his mistakes. Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but it's not. He avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. The power of music lies in its ability to move people.'"

**D.** After a recent successful book, the author has written a sequel with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life is still a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, with Rosie as her ally in managing suitors and friends. By the end, Aurora must face the passage of time and the rise of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness beneath ordinary life and highlights the randomness of events.

**E.** Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses her impressive descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery each person experiences. They return home with their spirits renewed by life on the ""desert cities of waves."" The author uses striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both alienating and enlightening."
CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their different jobs: the highlights, the challenges, and their typical workday.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**

**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and start work by 8 am. I begin operating at 8:30 am. I operate all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and some Friday afternoons. Most head surgeries take three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or using the bathroom. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I sometimes worry about the next day's tasks. Brain surgery is often a last resort, but when it succeeds, it's very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain operations. I enjoy talking to patients, but time pressure can make it hard to comfort them if they get upset. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first few days about my patients, and I dream about operating. I find it hard to switch off.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**

**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. My team includes three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of the work is design; the rest is production. I receive a brief from the client and spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting my ideas, we agree on estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers to ensure everything is on time. Managing people is a big part of my job, and clear communication is essential. I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Juggling multiple projects can be stressful, with deadlines always approaching. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, often at a pub. Otherwise, I have sandwiches and work through. It's satisfying when a client likes your designs, but disappointing if the work is rejected. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. It's hard to relax when I'm busy.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**

**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually get up at 7 am, but two or three times a week, I meet early flights and wake up between 4:30 am and 5 am. Around 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is sedentary, I watch my diet and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snack during the day. Clients often ask for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing me to plan routes. Not everyone is polite; some passengers are rude, but most are well-behaved, and I have a good rapport with regular clients. Sometimes I overhear conversations and must focus on driving. The press has tried to get me to talk about clients, but I don't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and try not to get too tired. I aim to be in bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**

**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I get up at 7 am, leave by 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but mostly private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each. By 11 am, we get hungry and go to a cafe for breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so I check messages and return calls when I get back. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I arrange an evening consultation. We use old materials and unusual plants to make gardens look aged. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren't great, but it's satisfying to see a garden completed and blooming. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I hear the business phone. I sleep well because the physical work is tiring. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. It's a tough job, but it allows creativity.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. As assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I ensure contractors follow the schedule and safety standards with minimal environmental impact. I coordinate site professionals and solve problems. Contractors start at 6 am, so I first check with the clerk of works about overnight progress. My day depends on this information. I review paperwork and answer design queries. Lunch is usually half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. When contractors are on break, it's easier to inspect the site. Checking their work can cause conflict, so we maintain open communication. I see the duty resident engineer daily, but act immediately if urgent issues arise. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am always on call."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Discuss Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**

I wake up at 6 am and reach the office by 7.30 am. I handle customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My duties include launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I maintain contact with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and responding to emails. I oversee advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. My day is filled with meetings, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets once or twice a week to address issues. When in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**

I start work at 10.00 am, going through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. Calls begin around 10.30 am from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists. Listening to demo tapes, I try to be constructive, knowing it's important to the artists. I decide if the sound fits our label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I communicate my vision for the album to the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets. I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and often attend gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit artists in the studio. My social life revolves around work, and I often get home by 1.00 am, listening to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**

I wake up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9.30 am. I check the mail and diary to see if we have client visits. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales. We sell antiques priced from Â£1,000 to Â£6,000, buying from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with gilders, framers, and repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette during coffee breaks to stay updated and visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts monthly and do tax returns quarterly. I go home at 5.30 pm, taking about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work set shifts, leaving home at 6.00 am for early shifts. At 7.00 am, I take over one of four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a break. The team includes controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, and we manage aircraft movements. We handle about 1,000 movements daily in winter, more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new requirements. It's crucial to be alert, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if unwell. The job is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I aim to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager.

**E. Shop Manager**

On early shifts, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend mornings helping customers and ordering books. I enjoy customer service, though it can be frustrating when customers expect quick service based on reviews. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm, publishers' reps visit, and I discuss new titles, considering how many copies to order. It's vital to ensure new titles arrive on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. Twice a week, I work late shifts, closing the system and locking up before going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then take a taxi to work, arriving by 8.45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first preview is due by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am, so I work quickly. I type stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make changes before publishing. I travel to Africa three times a year to report on events. I leave work around 6.00 pm, but it's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1.00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**

A good leader inspires and guides others. Leadership isn't about physical traits like height or intelligence. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is crucial, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon suggests saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Recognizing Leadership Potential**

John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, believes many people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing these hidden talents. While we can easily see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is essential for effective management.

**C. Comparing Leaders and Managers**

Think about the best and worst boss you've had. Both might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines, but how did they achieve them? The best leader motivated and supported you, while the worst made you feel insignificant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second managed poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**

Leaders and managers are different. Managers work within set boundaries, while leaders create new horizons. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" writes that a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**

Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:

- Leadership is best when chosen. Find your passions and act on them when inspired.
- See yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
- While collaboration is good, sometimes firm leadership is needed. Experiment with your style. If you're a natural negotiator, try taking the lead and see how it changes outcomes.
- Set goals and exceed them. Identify areas in your job where leadership can enhance your effectiveness and career prospects.

**F. Developing Leadership**

- Leadership develops from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.
- Your leadership style may not immediately win over colleagues. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.
- Be visible and accessible to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and help others develop as leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It follows oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud, remind us of heroes in Howard Hawks' films. The production design and special effects are impressive, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of Andrew Marton's version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal offers an interesting contrast to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often truer to the book. It focuses on a single soldier and his tough sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer, Marton's has its moments, like the harsh flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler stands out among musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a cunning villain, while Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is brief. Daniel Auteuil, as an acrobat-turned-swordsman, adds a moody presence. The film uses costume-drama clichÃ©s with such wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film is visually detailed but feels like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless in evicting tenants. The story centers on his tense relationship with his son, but the filmmakers focus too much on period details, overshadowing the dark narrative.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video highlights director Leone's skills. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and Morricone's music adds excitement. Morally, there's little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee Van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck features 'forty-eight international stars.' With four directors and 23,000 extras, it's an overdone production. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow for both them and the audience. Logistically impressive, it loses impact on video and is best suited for the big screen."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is truly gripping. The story follows a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are intense, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there's a surprising twist in the final pages. This is an impressive debut in a competitive genre.

**BOOK B**  
*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We are confident he will solve the mystery. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it's still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
*File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah proves to be a strong and capable character.

**BOOK D**  
In *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker, private investigator Spenser helps his friend Hawk clear drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and sharp, with more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker delivers high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn as they investigate an attack and burglary at a famous film star's daughter's house. The author's smooth writing style and insight into human behavior make this an engaging mystery.

**BOOK F**  
Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock team up to write *Blood Red, Snow White*. It features a lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the plot unfolds. Romance, money, and violence are skillfully combined to create a captivating suspense novel.

**BOOK G**  
*Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a potential victim. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels his career is not going in the right direction. While entertaining, this book doesn't quite reach Shaw's usual high standards.

**BOOK H**  
*Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best work in a while. Canadian police are on the hunt for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, expertly-paced tension and the portrayal of the intelligent, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He wonders why he and others his age decide to take this step. This summer, Tim quit his job, rented out his flat, and planned to travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think he's lucky, but he's nervous. It's not his first time traveling. After university, he spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When he returned, he wanted to do it again someday. But life happenedâ€”he fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, he realized he was sacrificing his happiness for his job. Resigning felt like taking control of his life again. Now, he has no ties. Many of his friends are married with children. They envy his lack of responsibilities. Tim is single and has no strong career ambitions, so he feels he should make the most of his freedom.

Why is he nervous? First, he needs to make arrangements. How can he let someone else live in his home? How will he organize the rental? He also needs to decide where to go. Tim is a procrastinator and is already behind schedule. He keeps delaying his departure, thinking of reasons to stay longer. Emotional ties make it harder. He wonders if he can still handle backpacking. Will he fit in with younger backpackers? Maybe. More Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives behind and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people realize they can have adventures if they're brave, organized, and confident.

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance for a final adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny is willing to risk job security for the trip. He knows he might not advance in his career, but he thinks it's worth the risk. When he left his office, he threw his calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance.

For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a transformation. The military has a set way of doing things, and he needed to change his approach to have a normal life as a civilian. There are many reasons to travel at this stage in life, but common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says the workforce is more flexible now. More people work on short-term contracts, so if a contract ends, there's nothing to lose. Some companies even have career-break policies to keep trained employees from leaving for competitors.

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more people in their thirties are re-evaluating their lives. If they're unhappy, they don't just stick it out. They know opportunities exist, and jobs aren't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess and think about life. Is wanderlust just a sign of not growing up? Jennifer Cox disagrees. She says it's a sign of a stable society where people want a balanced life. They ask, ""Is this what I want?""

Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. He's running towards something he wants. But he feels nervous about leaving behind a comfortable routine. Tim shares Ben's concerns about leaving an ordered life. He might not be traveling if his boss wasn't so difficult. Jennifer Cox says there's often a catalyst, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel. Tim needed a push, but now he's excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, he'll be proud of taking this step. He speaks for all older backpackers."
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the technological changes. She shares how she turned her family home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which seemed outdated due to technology. My resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the norm. It seemed unlikely anyone would hire me to work on a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required desktop publishing experience, which I lacked. I felt more capable of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than designing a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators confused me, and I couldn't use the video timer. Clearly, my career needed urgent attention.

I thought returning to work before my children left home would be difficult until I entered a local newspaper competition. Like a story you hear about but never experience, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We quickly adapted to this new world, learning terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing. We started chatting online with people worldwide. The children preferred the computer over TV, and I set up a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem for internet access. I had everything needed to work from home and still take the children to school.

The children were comfortable with computers from school, but I was hesitant, fearing I might lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although not an expert, I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical, easy, and foolproof. With perseverance, I learned more each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I enjoy having the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always a chaotic mess, and I often lost important notes. The computer made me organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads save time and effort. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated from human contact. There are distractions, like household chores, and when the children are home, we argue over computer time. Yet, more people are buying multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and entertainment. In my neighborhood, a new type of home-based industry is emerging, avoiding the daily commute to the city.

What defines home workers as we enter the next century? A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I seem ahead of the curve. Who knows, one day I might email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or rather cyberspace, is the limit."
CAE_59,"The Tartan Museum

The modern, cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are its contents as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You can't miss it. The Museum of Scotland is unmissable, located on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large, yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings, topped by a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some praised it as a 'masterpiece', others were cautiously approving, and some were hostile. This winter, as the inside is nearly ready for opening, the exhibitions might receive similar reactions.

Forget the debate about whether it tells the nation's story or is chronological. The answer is yes; it presents a rich tapestry of stories, each centered around a historic object, with a timeline to guide visitors without restricting the displays. It doesn't let national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels, get overshadowed by national pride.

The real question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, head of exhibitions, insists the visit should be enjoyable and visually appealing, designed for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this, Clarke is a purist about what is shown. He avoids mock-ups and imaginative scenes, believing they give a false sense of certainty about the past. He says, 'The public deserves the truth.' So, what you see is what experts know.

The question is whether the objects' stories can be told vividly enough with explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, using only about 30 computers in the museum. Less than three days before opening, it's hard to be sure. Some impressions are clear, though, and it's not just the views of Edinburgh Castle that are breathtaking. Inside, the sequence of spaces is striking. Galleries open into one another, with different sizes and shapes, pale wood-paneled walls, and deep display cases. Daylight streams through narrow windows and roof lights. There's space to appreciate every item.

Thanks to a Junior Board of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum has a Discovery Centre. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead got a dedicated children's hands-on center. The Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor, is the only temporary exhibition. It will change after three years and features objects chosen by Scottish people and others as impactful on 20th-century life in Scotland. The Prime Minister suggested an electric guitar; others chose televisions, Thermos flasks, and toys. While fun, it feels like a lightweight solution, not addressing serious issues. It might seem more substantial when the computerized bank of personal reasons and recollections goes live next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke seems right in saying 'objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else.' As for the modernist architecture: it works well from the inside and top, but whether it's in the right location is another question."
CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition is a comforting idea. Change can be scary for some and challenging for others. But transition suggests a smooth move from the present to the future. However, when it comes to newspapers moving online, this transition is uncertain and uncomfortable. You might think it will happen eventually since print newspaper sales are dropping while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8% to 10% year-on-year, but their website traffic is rising. This trend depends on factors like timing, demographics, and location. Experts from both the web and print industries agree on this shift. Yet, there are some details that don't quite fit. If sales in certain areas haven't dropped much, maybe the crisis mainly affects newspapers. But the situation is mixed. The World Association of Newspapers reports that global circulation rose by 1.1% last year, with sales in Asia compensating for declines in the West. News and current affairs magazines, expected to struggle in the digital age, actually saw a 5.4% increase. In both Europe and the US, some magazine sectors declined, but many grew rapidly. A similar pattern is seen with books. E-readers like Kindle are booming, yet physical book sales only fell by 0.4%. It's not just screen or paper; it's both. Claims that young people are abandoning newspapers are exaggerated. The National Readership Survey shows nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main national dailies. Different European countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline was only 7%, and in France, just 3.1%. These varied trends suggest a more complex situation than digital revolution predictions. In the US, media analysts once thought online ads would fund the shift to digital, but with digital ad revenues falling, this idea seems outdated. Now, 360 US newspapers have paywalls, including major ones. The best way to attract paying readers is to offer print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print ads earn much more than online ones. This difference is challenging for newspaper companies, as maintaining both print and online editions is costly and complex. However, newspaper brands still have a strong presence in print, and standing out online is harder.'"
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well is challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must consider actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera's presence can negatively affect these.

**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sitting or kneeling in front so all faces are visible, or raise your viewpoint.

**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They may become stiff and awkward. Help your subject relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this can create tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, though they might protest at first. They may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away, making the interest lie elsewhere.

**D. EYE CONTACT**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily to smile. They might not maintain this for long, so remind them just before you take the shot. You can also say something funny or unexpected to get a genuine reaction.

**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something within the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the subject. A laughing child, even if poorly dressed, can make the viewer smile, while a sad expression can evoke sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. SITUATION INTEREST**

While close-up shots of a person have impact, including their background can add interest and information. Exclude irrelevant details or blur them by focusing selectively. Ensure the subject isn't overshadowed by the background. A wide-angle lens can make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. INTERACTION**

When people are interacting, there are opportunities for great photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams working or playing sports make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a hand on the arm. Capture how one person reacts to another with expressions or gestures.

**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places visited. Care can improve these pictures. Use a standard or wide-angle lens to include the background. Ask subjects to come close to the camera, forming a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help. A good photo balances the subjects and the place, so both are equally interesting.

**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are just formal poses. Candid shots of events are more lively, especially when you know the subject well. A spontaneous picture can trigger memories better than a posed one."

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that isn't really there. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her and her art.

Unlike many artists, Sarah doesn't sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes the art is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and sometimes jokes that her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a bit shy about interviews. She even feels uncomfortable being photographed for this article.

However, once she relaxes, the interview becomes very interesting and funny. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't fulfill her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil piece, and she was hooked. She decided to start her own business, feeling she was on the right path.

Sarah's skills in observation and detail, developed through illustration, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil work. She believes that no one can teach you this art; it's all about observing life. She insists she's still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered a field, you might as well give up.""

Sarah is honest about her challenges, like struggling to paint bread realistically. She also doubts her math skills, especially when working on big projects like a chapel ceiling. She often questions herself and sometimes talks about her work as if someone else did it.

Despite her modesty, Sarah's work stands out. Trompe-l'oeil has become popular again, but not everyone does it well. Sarah has many important projects for both companies and private clients. Her work often draws inspiration from architecture, like a dining room designed to look like a Venetian palace or a painting that makes a hallway seem to lead to more rooms.

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must first trick you and then keep your interest by engaging your imagination. She believes the art should be personal to the client. She enjoys working closely with clients to develop ideas, and many have become her friends. Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who give her creative freedom.

Even though she downplays her talent, Sarah is always busy. She repeats that she doesn't like to boast about herself or her work. She believes that things that shout for attention can become boring. But it's hard to imagine anyone getting bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves more recognition, even if she prefers to stay humble."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' that are crucial for professional success.

**A** The way we are evaluated at work is changing. We are not only judged by our intelligence or expertise but also by how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is important for hiring decisions and determining who will excel or remain average. These skills are vital for future job opportunities, regardless of our current field. Unlike what we learned in school, doing well in exams is not enough. This new measure assumes we have the necessary intellectual and technical skills. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness, which are part of what is known as emotional intelligence.

**B** In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills', but now we understand them better as 'emotional intelligence'. This is the ability to understand and manage our own and others' emotions, using them to guide our thoughts and actions. In work life, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Emotional intelligence is not just about 'being nice'. Sometimes it requires confronting someone with the truth. It also doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely. Instead, it involves managing emotions so they are expressed appropriately, helping people work together towards common goals.

**C** More businesses are recognizing that emotional intelligence is essential for management. The more complex the job, the more important these skills become. Lack of emotional intelligence can limit the use of technical skills or intellect. While some people succeed despite weaknesses in emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that foster these skills have an advantage. In today's workplace, with its focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is increasingly important for success in any job worldwide.

**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people often become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can develop these skills to help us adapt, especially when job stability is uncertain. While it is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human element can hinder success."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often breaks on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there is guidance that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is a strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, showing that UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old, originating from traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat various conditions, but its effectiveness in pain relief has gained the most attention in Western medicine. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for this purpose.

**A. Understanding Acupuncture**

Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, known as Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that distribute Qi throughout the body. If the flow of Qi is disrupted, it can lead to illness or weakness. During an acupuncture session, the practitioner identifies imbalances in Qi by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and assessing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle habits. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin, sometimes with added heat or pressure, to stimulate Qi flow.

**B. Acupuncture Points**

The points used in acupuncture are linked to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. Patients often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is manipulated, either by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. This sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi. There are over three hundred main acupuncture points, with many more used less frequently.

**C. Scientific Explanations**

While Western doctors may not fully accept traditional Chinese principles, they acknowledge acupuncture's effectiveness in pain relief. Scientific explanations suggest that acupuncture may work by stimulating nerves to block pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving substances like endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**

Acupuncture is often a last resort for people with chronic pain. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-operative pain. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some Western doctors of its potential. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to eliminate pain without the side effects of conventional anesthetics, allowing quicker recovery.

**F. Effectiveness**

Clinical trials on acupuncture are challenging, but those conducted show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists report similar success rates, acknowledging that it may not work for everyone. For chronic pain, noticeable relief usually occurs after six or seven sessions, with some improvement after two or three.

**G. A Holistic Approach**

Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, considering not just symptoms but also underlying weaknesses in Qi and external factors like weather conditions. This comprehensive diagnosis is not typical in Western medicine.

**H. Traditional vs. Modern Approaches**

Some medical professionals are trained in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by following Chinese medicine principles can deep, lasting changes be achieved. When choosing an acupuncturist, ensure they can refer you to a medical doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"Text: P.D. James Barbara Michaels meets the famous crime writer, whose calm appearance hides a complex and brilliant imagination. Best-selling crime writer P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy, has a quiet authority about her. If she hadn't become a writer of detective stories with many twists, one could imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school. However, her authoritative look is actually a cover for her shyness. She admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her novels, is modeled on herself, or rather, how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like his creator. 'I need time alone, especially when writing. I can write almost anywhere as long as I have complete privacy.' She is too modest to agree that she is Britain's most famous crime writer, even though her 12 major detective novels are read by millions worldwide. She is a big fan of her close friend Ruth Rendell's works, especially the psychological ones written under the name Barbara Vine. Books by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively are often by her bed, though she also reads male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers great novelists of their time. Success came to P.D. James later in life. Now in her seventies, she was 42 when her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford, the eldest of three children, Phyllis grew up mainly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11. 'I met my husband there - he was a student at the university, and I have always loved the place. That is why I chose it as the setting for ""An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.""' She reluctantly shares that life has been hard, even tragic at times. Her Irish doctor husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II, where he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, very sick. 'I had to work long hours to support him and our two young daughters, Clare and Jane. I had many ideas, but I couldn't do much about them - I simply didn't have the time. My husband's parents were wonderful and took care of my daughters, giving them security during those difficult years.' While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. Then she spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department, doing administration for forensic science research, and then in the Criminal Law section, in the juvenile crime division. It was while working in forensic science that she became used to seeing corpses. But it wasn't a fascination with death that inspired her. 'It was the structure and construction of writing a crime novel that appealed to me. I have always enjoyed reading detective stories, and I always knew I wanted to be a writer.' 'I didn't want to use the traumatic events of my own life in fiction. Writing a detective story seemed like a great way to learn to be a serious novelist, and it was suitably distant from my own experiences. As I continued, I realized that one could stay within the classic detective story's formula and still write a good, serious, and revealing novel about people. Writing detective stories,' she says, 'is a way of bringing order out of disorder. Solving a crime confirms the value of life - even if that life is not lovable. Nobody really likes violence.'"
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a handwriting sample. Your handwriting could influence your chances of getting the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers claim it can help identify illnesses like heart disease and cancer and reveal psychological and emotional issues. It is increasingly used for career guidance and during interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of job candidates. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about graphology's value.

Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over 20 years of experience, argues that it should be taken more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting indicates social class and intelligence. It can assess mental ability, potential, and whether someone is suited for arts or sciences. It can also reveal if a person is devious or open.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology is useful in assessing criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually illiterate and poorly shaped. Many come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development, shown by childish handwriting and going over letters multiple times. I can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees.""

She notes that young male offenders often have high ascenders, indicating they live in a fantasy world. Graphologists can detect if violence is imminent, if the writer is under pressure, or if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can even predict potential suicides. Heart and lung problems can also appear in handwriting. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, it might indicate something serious.""

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. People with 'threaded' letters are devious and clever. Those who write in capitals are hiding their true selves. Light pressure indicates sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Small signatures suggest inhibition and inferiority; circles over the 'i' seek attention, and heavily crossing the 't' shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, combined with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to establish graphology scientifically. ""It's more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can understand a person's history and emotional crises without asking questions they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite these claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, saying handwriting is influenced by education, artistic ability, and writing style taught, with no other significance."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and good chairs are key to a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their findings:

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple with no central heating or mechanical ventilation. Windows open directly onto the street. Despite this, the small team seems happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like at home. This homely feel might be why they are content, as they don't deal with much external bureaucracy.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and often leads to bad postures. Chairs are old, many are broken, and not adjustable. However, the varied work schedule, which includes office tasks, client meetings, and presentations, helps reduce fatigue and boredom.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They find the office the right sizeâ€”small enough to know what others are doing, but large enough for personal focus. The office is both efficient and creative.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** The office is comfortable and well-maintained, with good air quality, helped by a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal with grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Walls are bare except for planners and a maternity rights poster. Staff relationships are satisfactory, but desk arrangements could improve information sharing. Displaying success stories could enhance the environment.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** The office feels like a glass case, but the air quality is good despite smokers. You can't smell smoke even close to a smoker.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements, but this is by choice. Computer setups are outdated.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and are aided by technology. The office is busy, but the wood paneling and brown carpet give a somber feel.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** The air-conditioning is poor, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered and dusty, with inadequate desk space. Dust from the roof can fall on people.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is more suited to a workshop. Chairs are old, lack adjustments, and have armrests that hinder desk access.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is dirty with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning due to many smokers. Few conversations were happening; everyone seemed stressed by deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and classless, with Americans consuming 12 million sticks daily. Learn how this ancient practice became a major industry. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the American Food and Drug Administration's standards. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to maintain flavor and texture. However, this wasn't always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians of New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, becoming the first commercial chewing gum there.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, live a tough and dangerous life. They travel long distances in high humidity to collect sapodilla sap. The conditions are harsh, with poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in the tappers' ears and nose. Despite these dangers, chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which is then boiled into bricks at forest camps. Life at these camps is difficult, with a basic maize diet and local alcohol.

Despite the challenges, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. once imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle annually from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetics to cut costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. Gum is said to help you relax, boost energy, and reduce tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. Its biggest claim is that it reduces tooth decay by increasing saliva flow, which neutralizes plaque acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and vegetable oils are used to blend the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of America are dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

The facilities are basic, with hot water provided by bucket, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**

The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favorites. I discovered it by chance while climbing. After reaching the peak and descending, I was surprised to find this hotel in such a beautiful, wild location. It was amazing to arrive exhausted and find luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**

Located on a peninsula in the southwest of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is in a quiet area. The road to the hotel winds along the coast past empty beaches. The hotel is not small, and many enjoy the free watersports, but you can find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, as the light fades, you feel far from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**

The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia offers one of the Caribbean's most stunning views. It is quiet and remote, situated 1,000 feet up, with open rooms overlooking the Pitons and the Caribbean Sea.

CAE_47,"Text: 'Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton observed her work. Just one minute into her inspection at the Globe Hotel, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy on the phone, unaware that she is ignoring an important guest. 'She hasn't even acknowledged us,' Sue whispers. 'Very poor.' This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't an ordinary three-star hotel,' she says. 'It has three red stars, so I expect better.' Red stars mean the Globe is among the top 130 of 4,000 hotels in the guide published by Sue's organization. Even before the cold welcome, the entrance from the car park was through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. 'Not what I expected,' Sue comments. Things get worse when the receptionist says, 'We have no record of your booking.' Only three of the hotel's 15 rooms are occupied that night. One room on the top floor is not to Sue's liking: it's stuffy, and there's a large hole in the wall behind a wardrobe panel. Early in her career, Sue was known for being tough. 'The Woman in Black, they called me,' she remembers, 'though I never wore black. And I was never too tough.' The next morning, after paying her bill, Sue reveals her identity to the Globe's manager, Robin Greaves. He looks terrified. Before she says more, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocked drain,' he says. 'The whole floor might need to be fixed.' Sue suggests they should not take guests to that lounge. 'Better to use the other lounge,' she advises. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run. Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, who shared information about the hotel's 400-year history. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, 'What do we need for three rosettes?' Sue suggests, 'Don't serve a pudding that collapses.' Greaves' brief hope fades. Sue's job is to voice complaints that others might not. 'Sometimes it's delicate. Once, a woman complained I got her son fired. I just told the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers.' Sue often receives letters with false accusations, from having a superior attitude to demanding bribes. 'You get used to it, but it still hurts,' she says. Sue must give her findings verbally and in a full written report. Hotels pay for this service, as there is an annual fee for being in the guide. Being recognized with red stars is valuable. Greaves is relieved to hear Sue won't recommend removing the Globe's red stars. The bad news is another inspector will visit in the next two months to check improvements. 'Good,' Greaves says, not very convincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.''"

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. His journey began later in life, and he recounts his climbs in the order he completed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the summit when Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, likely due to lack of oxygen. Doug also found himself talking to his feet, worried about frostbite. Despite these challenges, Doug felt confident with Dougal by his side and managed to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
In April 1976, Doug and Dougal faced the world's most dangerous mountain. They carried all their gear on their backs, a first for a new route on this mountain. The low air pressure made it feel like they were at a higher altitude. After a tough climb, they reached the summit.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite intended to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle, struggling to find water, but eventually found a trail. They attempted a challenging route but switched to an easier path to reach the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, joined a group to climb Aconcagua via a less crowded route. Due to time constraints, they avoided the Polish Glacier and took the standard path to the summit. Meeting other climbers inspired Doug to consider climbing all Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh weather, they reached the summit in eight hours. The experience was exhilarating, though visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In summer 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they took a cableway partway up and continued on foot. They initially thought they reached the summit but had to cross another ridge. They returned safely the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and interact with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they climbed the mountain, reaching the summit by late morning. This marked Doug's completion of the Seven Summits, achieving his mission."

FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the installation of the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost Â£250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, fitting for a five-star hotel. MacCann is pleased with its efficiency and the features it offers. For instance, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. The Merrion has a high-tech system to manage this. Guests can adjust the temperature within three degrees of the standard 18Â°C, and the front desk can set each room between 14Â°C and 25Â°C. However, it is the in-room technology that guests, especially business travelers, appreciate the most. MacCann estimates that 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. To cater to them, the hotel has moved the traditional business center into individual rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.

Technology evolves quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future upgrades. Extra cables are in place for new advancements. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be easily updated, and DVD recorders can be upgraded as needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann ensures that guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

As with all luxury hotels, excellent food is essential. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his business to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. For the hotel, having a popular restaurant on-site is a great advantage without financial risks. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."

This harmony is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also inherited their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and although Danny initially doubted some of her choices, he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan focuses on detailed studies of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants in their natural setting, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the process of flowers decaying fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being placed in water, becoming more interesting over time.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She wasn't interested in gardening back then and preferred wildflowers over garden flowers, which she thought looked artificial. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Today, her garden includes plants from distant countries, but they thrive as if they belong there. Susan has a relaxed approach to gardening, similar to an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She now employs an extra gardener but believes that to stay connected with her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area were knocked down during the severe storms in March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square, which changed the town center's look completely, much to the annoyance of its more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind also brought down the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too ill to notice. Usually healthy, he was seriously sick with bronchitis for the first time. When he first felt a headache and chest tightness, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. Believing the police force needed him, he ignored her and tried to keep working. This only made him forgetful and irritable, though he wouldn't admit it. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy for antibiotics and then home to his unsurprised wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't process it. That evening, he weakly asked about damage to the house, was relieved to hear there was none, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, his fever dropped, and he got up, that he realized the walnut tree's loss had permanently changed the living room's appearance. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The leafy garden gave a sense of privacy. Now, the storm had changed his view. Before, the living room's view included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't darken the room because there was another window on the opposite wall, but it created interesting light patterns that hid the worn furniture the family brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room was harshly bright, showing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was now dominated by the tall house next door, with its unattractive purple bricks and external pipes, and many upstairs windows seemed to watch the Pelhams' every move. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham croaked to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more pleased than upset. ""That's what I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall, reaching about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. On the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts; trees swayed, but the branches held firm. Yet, we knew we had reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient but not our main concern. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that posed the biggest threat. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

As the snow started to melt, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning of what was to come. We began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell, and the reservoir in the hills was filling up, nearing danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls as water surged over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was deeper than ever, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to recede.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only occasional overflows. Thanks to this protection, we can enjoy the clouds over the valley and appreciate the river's power, feeling that our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his decade-long career at The Front Page newspaper. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first serious job. Before that, he reviewed novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did various tasks for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also had experience in radio and television. Tom hired him, but he wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have been more selective with his staff. Initially, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have weekly lunches to choose what to review from the material Tom selected, with guests to keep things sociable. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market, just as unlikely as a millionaire wanting to help him personally. Mark lacked self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to his review, he felt awkward. Tom's idea for a team of critics never worked out. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. The public preferred reviewers to focus on one subject, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have the current setup, where Mark writes a detailed weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him. He wouldn't have liked the typical film critic's job of reviewing every film, which would quickly bore him. He would dread watching films he didn't enjoy. The space he has allows him to expand his arguments or, in a dull week, create something interesting. But what is his role in the public eye? He thinks people choose films based on stars, publicity, or directors. Loyalty to a genre or its opposite also plays a role. It's rare for someone who dislikes westerns to watch one after reading a review, or for a romance fan to skip a love story because of a review. So, if a film review isn't a consumer guide, what is it? Mark doesn't feel responsible for being 'right' about a movie. He doesn't think there should be a set number of 'great' or 'bad' films each year. His job is to present an argument. He's not a judge, nor does he want to be."
FCE_46,"Text: Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a passion for endurance sports WANTED: Training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Opportunity to train with a potential Olympic champion. Must be very enthusiastic about distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoys winter training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (loves 100km rides). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km without stopping. It's exciting for spectators, but why do triathletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a talented 17-year-old with excellent academic results give up everything for this challenging sport? Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge, and higher goals that most athletes use. ""You swim 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. After the 40km cycle ride, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you're exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second-fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place. ""I was following this man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried throughout the run."" But she didn't give up and is determined never to. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I'm afraid that if I let myself stop once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but while most people step off when they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will cover the Â£1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a Â£2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with Â£1,000 off"") so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another cost. Her intense training sessions have made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events. She has attempted the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her love for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It's a world full of passion and excitement. But remember, only collect items you truly love.

Since ancient times, people have felt the urge to collect. Early humans collected pebbles for their beauty and wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their shapes and colors.

I've been a collector all my life, gathering everything from tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I went to a school in a remote, windy part of England. My parents would take me to a local museum filled with fascinating objects collected by others.

Many people share my interest in collecting. The reasons vary, but some find it gives them a sense of control. For me, it's simply enjoyable. Historical collectors like the Duc de Berry in France had 'rooms of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You don't need to be wealthy to collect; I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination.

I once convinced a fellow tulip collector to give me a bulb I wanted. Sadly, it was later stolen. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire, which was very upsetting.

I'm fascinated by how collections change hands. A silver spoon once owned by a king or poet gains value because of its history. As items become popular among collectors, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable investments, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I regret throwing mine away along with the toys.)"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work: Four People Talk About Their Jobs**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This involves planning, designing, and promoting them. I research the exhibition topic and consult with experts to define the main themes and goals. I decide which objects and pictures to display and ensure the public understands the exhibition's concept. This includes planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also coordinate with engineers and electricians to ensure safety. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform the public.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents for learning the routes needed to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are figuring out the best routes, considering one-way streets and turns. I step in when there's a disagreement, like whether a right turn is possible at a junction. As they near the test, I challenge them by closing off their chosen routes, making them find alternatives. This helps them think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone enquiries, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. I often work with schools and study centers, and I run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better, which often changes their perspectives. I love my job because conservation is my passion, but working for a charity means constantly needing more funds, which limits what I can achieve.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain stock of about 300 books. We uphold high standards of information and content. We receive many letters about issues like international boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there's too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"Text: 'No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have expanded it, but they've done it very discreetly. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. We had gone away together the summer before to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't successful because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, though my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school, as Dekko Deacon sounds quite good. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his surname, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive, as she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she instructed the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people visit Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that; her husband handles redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He smiled broadly, his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel like more than just hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I felt the others thinking our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not as long as usual because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat by the window, we could see some strolling on the lawns, others taking the cliff path to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years, this pattern had developed. Since we first came here, we'd all fallen in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.'"
FCE_67,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live at the chalet. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing the guests' breakfast. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest has finished breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go skiing herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was about six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a bush of wiry hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could see his factory, and sometimes he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed very serious, by giving them a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how Marie's father made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand,' Seymour replied. She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' He was pleased that she was interested in every detail. 'They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet,' she said. 'Well, you should visit one if you're writing about leather. I can arrange that for you. They're primitive places. Technology has improved things, but it's not much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere, with 6,000-year-old relics discovered in Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. It's an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for days. That's typical: glovemen love the trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have,' she replied. 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She had made him laugh. She was an eager learner, full of spirit. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. The intelligent enthusiasm that filled the house when Marie came home from school, full of what she'd learned. How she remembered everything, neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. 'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to take you through the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"

She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often has to travel at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small issue - she dislikes flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,' she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so cramped with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. Her tasks include organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with a pop group's manager led to an offer to work behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy, especially since golf is his passion. However, there were downsides. Caddies earn a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings. Average earnings are between Â£25,000 and Â£35,000, much of which goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, who made him a statistical data administrator. He compiles and analyzes statistics from cards brought in by caddies, which are used by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try dishes at top restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend Â£120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave.' His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, then a creative director at an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still cooks at home and tries to keep fit by cycling a few miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but mostly wrote verse. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing out the morning's notes - all with one finger on an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that's the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were large piles of soft sawdust, like golden mountains, reaching down to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof, landing on the sawdust and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, encouraging them to follow. Laughing, he watched them hesitate, but one by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them said, ""Let's go up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went back up and jumped off again, determined, until only Michael was left. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the roof, nervous and unsure why it seemed so much higher this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists, trying to count to ten and jump. When that didn't work, he tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. The others started laughing, tired of waiting, and it was getting late. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they began to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, staring at the ground, feeling unhappy. He was alone for nearly an hour as the sun set, a big orange ball over the lake. His clothes were wet with sweat from nerves. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was silent; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to be home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled severity, but Michael, gloomy and miserable, barely heard her.

FCE_44,"Text: 'Careers Advice Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change jobs are turning to careers advisers. You'll need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help create a summary of your skills and suggest possible careers and retraining options. I decided to try Career Analysts, a large career advice organization. Taking the test felt like being back in school exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions quickly. It was important to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The psychometrics involved tasks like finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the tests, I had a long discussion with an adviser who gave me a report with observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, though I was surprised to learn I did poorly in scientific and technical tests. It's probably good I didn't become a nurse. However, I was reassured to hear I made the right choice in journalism. Rethinking your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, after five years as a marketing manager at an insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to review my career and skills,' says Donna. Some results were surprising. 'I didn't know I had a talent for design. But I had to consider the cost of retraining against my financial needs,' she says. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my existing skills and move to a job better suited to me than insurance. I'm now a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to friends who are also happy with the service.' Some people feel they wouldn't have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make big decisions. 'After six years at a bank, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I had no idea what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course this year. The advice was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.' However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I was unsure about my career path. I hoped a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary cut or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt a friend could have given similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you'll notice bright modern paintings and a stylish blue couch where patients sit during their check-ups. Jerome explains, ""Half of the people only visit the dentist when they're in pain, not for regular check-ups. They're scared."" To change this, he has created a welcoming environment. ""That's why I don't wear a white coat. People often link it with pain. I believe dental treatment should be relaxing, interesting, and even enjoyable.""

This approach is surprising for many who associate dental visits with pain or clinical settings. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they'll forget past negative experiences."" One of his new techniques is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first in Britain to use them, and they're very popular. During the initial check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view of their mouth."" Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit.

Another important aspect is the pleasant smell in the office, more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today, it smells of orange. Jerome says, ""I want people to realize with all their senses that this isn't a typical dentist's visit. Smell is crucial. The usual dental smell can make people anxious."" I found the scent in the office very pleasant.

Although known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. Relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of treatment is the top priority. For instance, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels unusual at first, but it's not painful if people are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to research dental techniques. ""I learned that making it easier for the patient makes it easier for the dentist,"" he says. He sees his patient-focused approach as the beginning of a shift towards less formality in British dentistry.

Just then, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a huge global business. During Easter, people in the UK spend over Â£230 million on chocolate, with eight percent of all chocolate sales happening at this time. Only at Christmas do people consume more chocolate. Large-scale chocolate production began in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago.

The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a 17th-century misspelling.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish preferred it with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company later added milk solids, giving us milk chocolate.

At the turn of the century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to add some French charm. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, launched as Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising linking it to the healthy qualities of English countryside milk, challenging the more luxurious French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars each week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. The latest trend is the 'extended line,' where chocolate bars become ice creams, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to those tired of regular snacks.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. Many small-scale farmers were forced out of business. Perhaps you could think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83, Peter Cooke has mastered his art. He still wants to try new things like paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the past ten years. As he shows me around his apartment, he worries about being boring, but his charm and the beauty of his work make him an enthusiast, not a bore.

Cooke points to shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace, saying he wouldn't mind if they don't sell because he loves them. He never intended to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to hold an exhibition. The result was a successful show in London, where 70% of the pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday, with prices reaching around Â£2,000 for some ornaments. Cooke is open about the prices, claiming no one else creates work like his. The gallery owner told him that once he stops, his pieces will become even more sought after.

Cooke wishes he had started earlier, as he feels physically limited now, but he still produces remarkable work. His creations are far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. He has a ""miniature mind,"" leading to intricate boxes, shaded pictures, and realistic flower baskets made from shells. Cooke has developed his own methods, using materials he finds, like cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases and a special glue from a sail-maker. He washes the shells with washing-up liquid. Although he claims his work ""just does itself,"" the detail, color gradations, and symmetry show careful attention.

His search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him beyond Norfolk to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. Cooke only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming beaches. He argues that people walking on the beach destroy shells faster than he can collect them, and the sea breaks up the rest. He insists he never collects shells with living creatures or dives for them. His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty of his work, which often surpasses the natural beauty of the shells themselves."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer isn't traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, she's likely studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I had been trying to convince myself that all the negative things I had read about models were untrue, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to mind. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided a trip to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be rushing. She could be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.

But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira wasn't wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained, and apart from looking very young, her mother was a normal mum - clearly proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. It was her older sister who decided she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When the call came to tell her she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.

Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have gotten used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, ""They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a bad way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her she is needed for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"Father and Son Search for Gold

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat in search of gold. Terence, an explorer, and his son Chris, a mineral expert, believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""We are finding high levels of gold; we just need to dig a few more meters to reach where it is concentrated.""

Their gold search began when Terence read about gold worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing the land and finding gold bits in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running out of money. They need to find a backer to invest Â£50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""It looks doubtful, but we have some people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread, the idea of finding gold excited both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would bring more people here if they are right, but I hope millions don't come and damage the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed recently. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. When she isn't teaching, she dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a small steel vehicle for underwater exploration. Inside, space is so tight that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they can't stand or move, and must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there's an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant trip.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment there to study the effects of a program that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research into ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees. The only time Rachel was scared was during a dive with Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more stress. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign schedules, currencies, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the following year. And the next. All I needed was one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in a train corridor, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your belongings in a backpack makes you have a very basic approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness, like burning socks that have become too unpleasant, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, where common sense and reasoning can be thrown out along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I initially thought this type of train ticket was just a cheap way to get to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting, as there was always just one more country over the border, always a little further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in planning our own schedule, we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was a chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and to have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city you arrive in never actually existed until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you see it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your baggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and have to wear unsuitable clothes. Airlines rarely say how many bags they lose, but regular travelers will eventually face this issue. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can guarantee that your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes. 

Here's how the system works. Airlines require you to check in early to give enough time for your baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Normally, the system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights, causing the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause problems. These issues are more common at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to Latin America.

To avoid losing your baggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or want a cheaper flight, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"Text: 'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, partly shading the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, mud browns, and the many yellows of sunlight, as gentle as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light and motion that is so striking you almost feel it. It disappears in a split second, but the image stays in your mind, its impact much larger than its size. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He can't quite explain what draws him to this little bird, which is part of many legends. In Greek myth, the kingfisher is a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some scientific truth to this. Despite the many blues in their feathers, kingfishers have no blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can appear to change from bright blue to rich green with a slight change in light angle. It's no wonder some wildlife photographers are so enthusiastic about them. The colors, combined with the fact that kingfishers, though shy, can be watched from a hideout, create a lifelong passion. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. But it took him four years to get his first good picture. Meanwhile, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream rich with kingfishers. School limited his time with the birds, so he skipped classes, becoming what he calls an 'academic failure'. But his interest in the kingfisher, the only member of its family to breed in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and gradually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,' he says. 'I'm drawn to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings...' His sentence trails off as he thinks of the bird's colors that still excite him after so many years. His photographs convey some of his feelings, but as Charlie knows, there's much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show.'"

**A. ANNE MANSON**

Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she asked to observe Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna and ended up filling in for an absent assistant. This led to more opportunities, including assisting Abbado on several projects. Manson, originally from the US, now works with a London-based opera company focused on modern works and is gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**

Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after previous unsuccessful attempts. The win provided many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, Constantine is concerned about being permanently labeled as a ""competition winner."" He hopes to be known for his work with orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which continues to invite him back.

**C. WASFI KANI**

Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods of opera productions. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties, supporting herself with a job in London's financial district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional. Lessons with Sian Edwards were pivotal for her, as Edwards was similar in stature, which made a big difference. Kani appreciates the complexity of opera, including managing singers' personalities.

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**

Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly fascinating. He started as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's ""Agrippina"" from the piano at a festival, which was easier than he anticipated. Vignoles feels his broad musical experience benefits him in conducting. He is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys most.

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**

Wayne Marshall, now 32, was noticed by conductor Simon Rattle in 1986, which led to his first conducting job in London. Despite challenges, like dealing with musicians who were not fully engaged, he remained firm and clear in his direction. Marshall has never formally studied conducting but relies on his determination and clear vision. He believes in expressing his needs confidently to get the best results."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try out some of the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. Thereâ€™s a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay longer. Our only complaint is that the park lacks atmosphere, and the scenery could be better. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and focused on security.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didnâ€™t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is perfect, and the staff are friendly. Thereâ€™s something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, especially the trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think youâ€™ll get wet, but you donâ€™t. Toy Land is great for younger children. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small for it, which was a relief for us! The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isnâ€™t too boring. Itâ€™s very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, I couldnâ€™t sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at one oâ€™clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides arenâ€™t too scary. Iâ€™m usually afraid, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didnâ€™t try the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park advertises 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europeâ€™s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is the most terrifying ride according to Ben, although Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older kids went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but not all were welcoming. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldnâ€™t have dared to tell the kids we were leaving early."

Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly turnover of over Â£200,000 and employs four full-time staff. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Having worked with computers before marriage, her husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. Christine was careful with finances, always informing the bank manager if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, with local clients often collecting their work.

**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards from home. She says, ""I enjoy being independent."" After studying art at university, she wanted to work in a museum, but living in the countryside offered no such opportunities. So, she started her own business, creating 50 different greeting cards sold to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is the constant distraction of household chores. Her business grows through word of mouth, without advertising. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started eight years ago when the business was growing, and her turnover increased from Â£24,000 to Â£80,000 in two years. She once managed six full-time curtain-makers but had to let them go due to economic decline, which was difficult as jobs are scarce in the area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and employs women who work from their homes. Delia adapts by cutting prices when needed and exploring new opportunities.

**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and her love of the country. She enjoys flexible working hours, though 80% of her income comes from international deals, requiring calls at odd hours. The challenge is maintaining discipline to separate work from home life. Tessa publishes children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt isolated, having gained all her professional experience in London.

**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly turnover of Â£250,000, employing six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with quality ingredients. As demand grew, she began sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is now made, employing a baker, assistant, and professional cake-icer. Meg no longer bakes herself, focusing on the business side. Her biggest challenge has been managing finances, as they started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is unique because not only are the sons composers and award-winning musicians, but their father also makes musical instruments. John and Hetty Watkins, schoolteachers from South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, to match his growing talent. The cost of buying one was too high, so John decided to make one himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello for Paul. Paul, now 28, used this cello until recently. John has since retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling one to the famous American violinist Jaime Laredo was a highlight for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano and then moved to the cello, inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Although his parents wanted him to play the violin, he preferred the cello. Huw, now 22, chose the piano and composition, finding inspiration in Paul's success.

Paul's cello, made by his father, helped him win the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. He now plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. John admits the new cello has a special quality that his own creation might develop over time.

Paul will soon perform Elgar's Cello Concerto on television with his Rugeri cello. However, he won't be able to watch it because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will need to be both diplomatic and energetic to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"Text: 'Caring for the Countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden employed by the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it owns. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense. 'You also need to be good with people because you're always dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building firms.' Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience got him the job, even though he didn't have formal training. 'It's helpful that I still farm with my parents and can relate to farmers and understand their problems. Also, they can't fool me about anything!' he says. His farming background also helps him handle the physical work of the job - putting up fences, planting trees, building walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. 'When I was young,' he remembers, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests. Recently, I wondered where I would find all those flowers, birds' nests, and grasshoppers now. It's clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just following government advice.' Gareth says that, when he started, farmers and conservationists were against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way. Now they are talking and understanding each other's views. 'We're at a crossroads and just need a small step to bring them together,' says Gareth. Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with public access to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to ensure jobs are completed with minimal fuss and cost. What I enjoy most is seeing projects finished, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills, and so on.' Gareth is passionate about his job and, despite never being off duty, he enjoys every minute of it, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just come into the area, demand everything, then leave as if it's their right. Having to be nice to those people is annoying!' But as Gareth says, it's all about common sense. So if you have plenty of that and like the idea of an outdoor job, you might consider applying to become a warden like Gareth - but don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for many years!'"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her typical day includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. When asked if she gets strange looks, she said, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra's life is now all about being at her best for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to reach peak fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they are expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start with a strong game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" England is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra notes that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win, but the Championships are different. There's only one chance, and you have to be ready.""

In her 15 years at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train so hard not to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the final whistle, we become different people. We're all friendlier after the game.""

Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. My role is to support and encourage the team.""

Kendra's netball career has always been carefully planned. She decided some time ago that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should parents handle a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always easy to know the best way to nurture their gift. Some parents might not even notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. While most schools can support children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

In Britain, there are five specialist music schools, which are relatively new. They offer a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, students spend one-third to half of their day on musical activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, though students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, living full-time at the school, which allows them to grow up with peers who share similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from Â£12,000 to Â£17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop 'rounded and well-balanced individuals.'

Separating musically gifted children from an early age can be stressful. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a strong sense of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help and advice when needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some question the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs aren't met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide about specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, like a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with top teachers and orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden provides many of her painting subjects, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly, spreading seeds throughout the garden. The garden has a harmonious mix of colors, shapes, and structures, thanks to the previous owners who were passionate gardeners. They left behind plants that Susan liked, and she also inherited their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They got along well, and Danny understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint certain plants.

Susan focuses on detailed studies of individual plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants in the garden, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one."" This process can take years to complete a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they decay fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and open up when placed in water.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers at first, thinking they looked artificial. She admired how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Now, her garden includes plants from distant places like China and the Himalayas, which thrive as if they were native.

Susan has a relaxed approach to gardening, similar to an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She hired an extra gardener but believes that to stay connected with her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'IsÃ¨re, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing the guests' breakfast. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest has finished breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go skiing herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning intensely. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are disoriented and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.'"

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. 'Choosing what to wear was difficult because I usually wear a uniform. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, and here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't usually stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.'

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. 'I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.'

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. 'I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, I don't see daylight because of my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.'

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked at Hammersmith Hospital. 'I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint, but I was surprised that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it was satisfying.'

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. 'I changed into the uniform, and I felt differentâ€”people looked up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.'

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. 'I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this, but it inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier.'"

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing sea views. No matter the weather or time of year, it is always enchanting. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**B. Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many rail journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**C. Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding preparations.

**D. Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliableâ€”we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still on their way. When it appeared, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriagesâ€”some even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**E. Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite impressions of trains when they are young, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming took place on an old, disused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I went back last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Trying to get published? If you're wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Readers often ask, 'I have written this story/book. Who should I send it to?' The first thing to know is that you should research the market and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Turning words into something sellable requires knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever you write, you need to understand the markets you're targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything relevant. Use your local library and visit bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will guide you on what kinds of writing publishers are accepting. This knowledge needs updating as new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go all the time. Publishers are always looking for new talent; as writers, we must give them what they want. At first, you might not be sure what you want to write. If you want to write short love stories, find out which magazines publish them and get recent copies. Familiarize yourself with the stories they buy and note who the readers are. These readers expect different things, and the editor focuses on their needs. Writers often send me stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - am I wasting my time?' As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But it's unlikely the work is ready for publishing, so I give an honest opinion with a positive outlook. Most new writers are too eager to send their work out, often before they're ready. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. When you send your work for the first time, start on more work while waiting for a reply; write ten more stories, even twenty. Each one will be better, and you'll start to see yourself as a writer, with growing fluency and confidence. Don't throw any awayâ€”improve them instead. I advise not showing your work to others, especially early on. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. See if there's a creative writing course nearby. If not, join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,"Text: 'No Title On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The usual airy, clean feeling of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students sat on the floor with their bags. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn't mind talking to her myself. The man asked, 'Are you travelling to Philadelphia by any chance?' 'Well, I'm going north,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he didn't respond, just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't; I probably seemed unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then moved to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She lowered her book. She was around thirty-five, older than me. A school-teacher type. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favour?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my wrist as if checking a watch. (I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags like pets on leashes. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, then went for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia, unsure what to do.' The woman clucked sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where this was going. 'I told her to stay put. Stay right there, I said, and I would find someone here to bring her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a weak excuse, in my opinion. Also, it was more bad luck than one family should have. I glanced at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been logical, but a padded envelope the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently.'"

My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and mine was running a restaurant. When I found out about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in bad condition, but it was perfect for my plans. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother working in a factory and feeling upset because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife focused on taking care of the children and did all my accounts, while I managed the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This has been great for our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life. Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he worked for pocket money. He started with odd jobs and by ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined. He would wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very academic, but he excelled in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He could produce over a hundred meals, and I knew he'd go into catering because he had talent. So when he needed work experience for school, I sent him to a friend's restaurant. Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. Who knows what will happen to his cooking if the music takes off. My advice to Gary is: if you chase two hares, you catch neither, so focus on the one you can catch. He understood when I told him: 'Gary, if you want to succeed, do it by 30. If not, it's too late.' Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping others. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it because no one gives you anything. He's seen his opportunity and grabbed it with both hands. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they take in even ten percent of what you've told them, you should be happy.

FCE_7,"Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was as difficult as finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often helped. But for someone like Jo, who had just arrived in Dublin, there were no personal contacts to rely on. She had to stay in a hostel and search for a place on her own. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She never questioned why she was going; it was just assumed by everyone at her school that she would leave. Who would want to stay in a small, remote town? That's all she had heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates had moved to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle in. But none of them were going to Dublin. Jo was going on her own. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, which was run by nuns, so she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn't know they were still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who seemed to have been rejected, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" ""Oh,"" said Jo and continued climbing. ""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" ""What did she do?"" asked Jo. ""Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Jo realized Pauline was a punk, which surprised her. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one before. ""I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called,"" she said. Nessa said they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs. One said ""Nessa,"" one said ""Pauline,"" and the other said ""Other."" ""We'll put your name on it if you stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society warns that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds discusses the decline of these animals.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, understand human emotions, and make us dream of freedom in the ocean. TV shows like ""Flipper"" and ""Seaquest"" have made us love them even more. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today. The North Sea harbour porpoise population, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000.

You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could become a major wildlife disaster. There are forty different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out at sea and are rarely seen. We know little about them. The bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found along the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few remaining show signs of stress.

Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to pinpoint why their numbers are dropping. Overfishing, which reduces fish stocks and threatens local fishing industries, also affects dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are overfished in one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses large nets that float or are dragged quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on French and Cornish beaches, showing marks from these nets.

Pollution also affects dolphins. Waste and chemicals in the sea can accumulate in their bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they build up in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk with high pesticide levels, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk.

Perhaps the most debated threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This may disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet understand."

You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but it's truly beneficial. There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to. Exercise improves muscle tone and quickly changes your body shape. It increases muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It prevents muscle imbalances that can cause injuries. Exercise also targets specific areas like thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored, but here's something new: exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep patterns. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. By now, these points should convince you that exercise is good for you. If not, common sense should. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, or weight training. Remember, training too hard or with too much weight can cause injury, so start slowly. If unsure, consult your doctor about what's best for you. Good posture is crucial for improving body shape. A stiff or sagging body is unattractive and lacks energy, leading to minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling your head up. This helps lift your chest for better breathing and makes your body look slimmer. When standing, if your chest is balanced, you should see your ankles. Stretching improves flexibility and movement, helps maintain posture, and prevents muscle injuries. Doing it four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period.'"
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What motivates filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman to leave their home comforts for months? It's the pursuit of the perfect shot. Among the many creatures in East Africa's jungles and plains, two of the hardest to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has faced six months of almost nonstop rain, leading to unexpected challenges. Newman mentioned they had to buy an expensive tool so Amanda can pull their vehicle out of the mud when it gets stuck. Their partnership has produced some of TV's best wildlife films, like their acclaimed film on leopards. Even while this film was airing, they were back in the wild, this time following the elusive jackal. This is common in TV partnerships. Traveling filmmakers have been exploring the globe to capture exotic wildlife since TV began.

I spoke with Newman during one of his rare visits to a safari lodge. ""We sometimes argue, but we resolve it quickly,"" he says about his colleague. Neither sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they view animals similarly. ""When we're on the move, we set up our tents each night. But now, we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m., we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask."" Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a concern,"" says Newman. It's a tough life, but being alone in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman recalls filming a lion family where a lioness would greet their car as part of her routine.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they spend four months on location for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start,"" says Newman, ""because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create films rich in atmosphere that capture the true spirit of the place and animals, touching people's hearts. Evoking an emotional response is better than appealing only to their intellect."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her typical day includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location. 'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she replied. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'

Kendra's life is now all about being at her best for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to reach peak fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 nations participating. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure and expectations from the home crowd. People expect us to start well.'

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we've always beaten them, but they're exciting to play. They have a lot of talent.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But Kendra notes that the World Championships are tough. 'You have to push yourself to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, there's only one chance, and you must be ready.'

In her 15 years at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the final whistle, we're all friendlier.' Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, she believes in having a strong mental attitude and leading by example. 'I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.'

'From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,' she says. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, her focus is on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"Text: 'In hot water Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, studying chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When not teaching, she dives three kilometres into the Atlantic Ocean in a small steel vehicle to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can touch the two pilots. We can't stand or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive can last 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.' 'If there's a problem and we need to surface quickly, we can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that rises rapidly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.' 'I didn't know how I would react the first time I entered the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and I got in with an instructor. He explained emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing my reaction to being in such a small space.' Rachel has now made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. On the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with chimneys blowing out black smoke. It's where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effect of a multi-national programme that would drill a 150-metre hole through a volcano.' When not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it to continue my research into the ""black smokers"". This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at one metre per second and at 350 degrees.' 'The only time I was frightened was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 'Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body language, and how we speak, including our tone and volume.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to come across in the best possible way."" Many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from words, 38% from voice, and 55% from facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.""

Finally, consider what you say and how you say it. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests informing yourself about the company before an interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confused sentences. As she puts it, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London but now runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was made redundant unexpectedly. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a top local hotel. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not in an office anymore, but surprisingly, I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor was surprised when I said, 'I don't want to go back to where I've been.' Most people in their mid-forties need to work immediately for money. But we married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown. We left our friends, but our friendships have survived, and many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner with even more hours, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that never happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always something to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss social interaction with colleagues, but I love being responsible for the product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my destiny."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports: Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I've always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. At 14, I had a trial with a professional football club, but I chose athletics. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing because I hoped for sponsorship to help with training costs. I train at home during winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because of the excellent facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to decline. Dedication is crucial in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics, which would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so late-night parties are out of the question. I miss sleeping in, but it's worth it. Without dedication, I wouldn't have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out, and if there's prize money, I treat myself to a nice trip. The sacrifices pay off because winning the championship led to presenting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and celebrate wins in style. Some say we act childishly, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can't focus on the sport all the timeâ€”it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've only been recognized in public a few times. I wouldn't want to be a celebrity. I get many requests for signed pictures, and I reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit overwhelming with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. It has downsides, though. My last girlfriend didn't like the attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport. You have to be serious and professional. I'm focused on my game now and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her children want everything they see, from sugary cereals to Disney videos and comics. She feels guilty if she gives in to their demands, but also feels bad for saying no all the time. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over Â£150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and health arguments about sugar don't compete well with appealing ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's important for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated that they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse is a major source of stress for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her children and has taught her son to be critical of ads. As a result, they have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they're unhealthy, even while buying treats for themselves. He acknowledges that it's natural for children to want nice things, but he still gets annoyed by their demands. His willingness to say yes often depends on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without a child's demands could attract more customers."
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the installation of the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost Â£250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, fitting for a five-star hotel. MacCann is confident it will pay off over time. 

For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible thanks to the guest-history feature, where staff can record various preferences. Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. A high-tech system allows guests to adjust the temperature within a small range, and the front desk can make larger adjustments between 14Â°C and 25Â°C.

Business travelers, who MacCann expects will make up 65% of the hotel's clientele, will appreciate the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. To keep up with fast-changing technology, the hotel has installed extra cables for future upgrades. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be easily updated, and DVD recorders can be upgraded as needed.

Despite all this technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms are designed to be both comfortable and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

As with all luxury hotels, excellent food is a must. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his business to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular and successful restaurant without financial risk. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."

I need to be doing something challenging. When I'm learning something new, I feel a lot of energy. Anything with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, also energizes me. Dance is expressive and energizing. I think you feel drained if you're bored or feel life is pointless. Being effective in the world, even in small ways, gives you energy.' B. Linda Kelsey Magazine editor: 'I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. I love being at work; it's not a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep, so when I get it, I feel great. When I only get six hours of sleep, I feel a bit off. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to find the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and try to do a workout at home. After exercise, my spirits rise a lot. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, so it's probably good to eat something then.' C. Annie Nightingale Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily for energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I can't stand negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy life and seize the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You need to achieve things and set goals. I enjoy my work, and the last two years have been very exciting. In my job, there are many lively young people, and you can't help but be affected by that. I love rushing around for jobs and having a busy life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photos, but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them developed and can't wait to see them. I've also started writing lyrics for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and a good mental release when I'm traveling.' D. Floella Benjamin Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family, and I think being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids; they give so much and have natural resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around and playing with the kids.' E. Deborah Moggach Author and playwright: 'What I love most is making a garden out of wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I broke up all the concrete and added lots of soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. Another thing that gives me energy is knowing someone wants to read what I'm writing - I find it hard to write without an audience. I also like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm caught, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' F. Katherine Monblot Therapist: 'I believe you must have interest and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be on various committees and resented the demands on my time. You only have so much energy, so focus it on what's most important to you.'"
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is important for balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your body weight; this means leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is key in skating, more than in other sports. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should turn outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It's quite simple, isn't it? As you practice, you can gradually increase the length of your movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for skaters. Even professionals fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when you fall, which reduces the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn basic figures, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch good or professional skaters, you'll notice how relaxed and smooth they are. To achieve this, you should regularly practice exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include the legs, back, and shoulders, focusing on the ankles and knees. After a long or intense session, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""The work is tough right now. There's no time for TV, hanging out with friends, or doing much besides gym and school. I take training one day at a time. When I'm extremely tired, my coach might give me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you'll get stiff.""

**B. Annika's Mother**

""Annika showed great potential from a young age. Some parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People say we've sacrificed a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. She used to be shy, but now she's confident and has met people worldwide.""

**C. Sarah Stokes**

Sarah started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me to events. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement. Even without my parents, I'd do it because I'm determined. I'm glad theyâ€™re happy when I win, but I do it for myself. My goal is to qualify for the British young riders team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

FCE_29,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, 'What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two metres tall at that age. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about a centimetre. More and more tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're evolving into a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from the caveman era. We're now overcoming the effects of generations of poor diet, which is having a big impact. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals occasionally. This lifestyle is still followed by a few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes. One study found that they used 85 different wild plants in their diet. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, which had serious consequences. Most green areas on the planet were taken over by farmers, and now just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This limited diet has negatively affected human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have relied on soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought to be a blessing of the New World, turned out to be a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. Despite this, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gatherer land. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with its own challenges. Heights have increased, but the world hasn't adapted. Standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers are constantly updating their product ranges. The question is: where will it all end? We can't grow forever. There must be a natural limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, from the University of Chicago, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller, an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies retain heat better.) Since the climate warmed, we have become slightly thinner and smaller, even with proper nutrition. As the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even more. In other words, global warming could counteract human growth.'"

I used to think studio audiences were just people eager for a brief moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life, professions, and income levels. TV shows aim to attract different types of people for different programs. Those of us who prefer watching TV at home might not understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and endure hours of waiting in an uncomfortable studio to watch something you can see at home?

One idea is that people hope to appear on TV for a moment. I doubted this until I met Angela, who said she came for the chance to be on TV. Another reason might be curiosity about what happens behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was simply, ""a friend gave me a ticket.""

Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it's like. You imagine sitting tightly packed with strangers, following signs to APPLAUD or LAUGH. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, ""We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed feeling part of live TV. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot."" Personally, I missed seeing live actors because my view was blocked. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I prefer places where nature and human elements mix. When I travel, I like visiting charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. At eight, I went to school in England and would cycle to Lastingham village on Saturdays. Cycling was my escape from school. I enjoyed exploring the hilltops, valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt both familiar and different. I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a diary, which was my first step into travel writing, a field where I later became known.

**Sophia**  
There's a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by enthusiasts. I always travel first class as it's only slightly more expensive. The scenery isn't spectacular, just Romney Marsh with sheep and a canal. But I love when the train passes through back gardens. We get a glimpse of people in their daily lives, like making tea or doing chores. I see myself as a woman on a tiny train, peeking into others' homes. The ordinary landscape attracts me, just fields, sheep, and a distant sea. It makes me look closer for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful, remote coast. The beaches are rocky and hard to reach, so there are few crowds. Some brave surfers visit, but most people come to admire the sea's majesty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through valleys full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. Few people live or visit there. It's a hidden, remote area, and I love the sense of space. I found it by chance as a student and have visited every year since, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It hasn't changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It saddens me that he grows up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon at twelve. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's my dream house, secluded and romantic. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals and enjoys being around them. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work, excited because she had found a pine snake. She asked if we could keep it, and I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank for temporary animal guests, and one night was enough to admire them and check our natural history book.

I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting for help from their bedroom. I rushed in to find Domino, our cat, with Bianca, a white mouse, in his mouth. Bianca was a Mother's Day gift to me. Domino was running around the room, trying to escape with his catch, while the kids waved their arms to stop him. I joined the chaos and accidentally fell over. As I lay on the floor, I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank.

The room was a mess of jumping kids, a barking dog, and the snake slithering around. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and returned to the bedroom. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived to old age.

Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I turned my attention to the snake. It was difficult to handle, but I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it down. Eventually, the snake relaxed, and I carefully lifted it. I took it to the garden, hoping it would choose to live in the shed. When I released its head, expecting it to attack, it instead wrapped around my shoulders like a shawl.

We stood there, my four children, the snake, and I, in the evening light. My eldest, DJ, explained why the snake stayed with me: ""You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it slowly climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed it up for all of us: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Drop me a line! In today's fast-paced world of phones, emails, and computers, the traditional art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter offers a unique experience that other forms of communication cannot match. There's the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it's from, and the enjoyment of reading it. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Occasionally, my father would write, and it was always a joy to receive his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday events involving my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but it's the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I often had relationships with people who had to work or study away, and we stayed in touch through letters. Instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found I could often express myself more easily in writing than in speaking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! It's even more exciting when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out on a wonderful friendship. Now, we have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even reported it on the front page. I am pleased that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they might not survive for future generations. The mountain, once a site for prayer and worship, is covered with 4,000-year-old drawings carved into bare rock. These include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as the site becomes more popular, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He describes seeing tourists stepping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and the artwork's details. Some visitors even take parts of the rock home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,"" he said. ""The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them properly, they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers describe how people arrive with long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or even their names into the rocks. But experts disagree on the best way to preserve the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, allowing the public only on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research work will be reduced.

Clottes disagrees. ""The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring protests from people who live there,"" he said. ""The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.""

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,"" he said. ""Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big, it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reachâ€”tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehiclesâ€”the damage will increase rapidly. She thinks the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she said. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her children want everything they see, from sugary cereals to Disney videos and comics. She feels guilty if she gives in to their demands, but also feels bad for saying no all the time. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over Â£150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and health arguments about sugar don't compete well with appealing ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always correct. It's important for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a biased view. Parents feel frustrated that they have to compete with advertisers and often end up disappointing their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. However, as Dibb notes, the goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy, so the effect is the same.

Deciding which of their children's requests to agree to or refuse can be stressful for parents. One mother says she discusses food with her children and has taught her son to be critical of ads. As a result, they have fewer conflicts in the supermarket because her children don't ask for things she won't buy.

Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says he refuses to buy sweets for his children because they're unhealthy, even while buying treats for himself. He finds it hard to be consistent, as his decisions depend on his mood.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering supervised play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers."
FCE_65,"Text: 'Climbing Walls Once, climbers only went to mountains. Now, challenging climbs can happen anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd watches closely. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events feature a climbing wall. This is possible due to new and fast-developing technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing angles. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, top climbers needed to stay fit. With cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This kept their fingers strong and helped avoid boredom. Soon, sports centers began building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges. Many early walls followed Don Robinson's example. He was a physical education teacher who, in the mid-1960s, built a climbing wall at Leeds University. Robinson's idea was to set natural rock in concrete blocks for walls. Many such walls were built in sports halls during the 1970s, but they had design issues. Walls were only vertical, unlike natural cliffs with overhangs and angled slabs. Once built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the repetitive holds. In 1985, a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, created a material shaped like natural cliff features. These could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted variety. French manufacturers also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhangs without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere. A system of interchangeable fixtures provided climbers with endless new holds.'"
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. Acting is indeed a risky career because there are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, while others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it's a personal decision, and only you can take responsibility for your ambition. There are no easy paths - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after training, you will succeed. It's about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new faces and talent, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes big rewards. People often ask what talent is. I think it's natural skill plus imagination, with imagination being the hardest to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you're doing. Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the key moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is central to all acting and motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might shrug because they don't really know. They understand their skills and techniques but take nothing for granted, knowing their success depends on their current job. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs. Suddenly, you get an audition, but you might not get the part, no matter how much you want it. So, actors don't talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of competing and possible rejection. Nobody likes rejection, and it's a possibility from the start. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it's up to you, because if you don't care enough, no one else will.'"

FCE_28,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - Chris was already almost two metres tall at fourteen. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by another centimetre. More and more tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're creating a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from the caveman era. We're now overcoming the effects of generations of poor diet, with significant results. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals occasionally. This lifestyle is still followed by the few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes. One study found they used 85 different wild plants in their diet. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, which had serious consequences. Most green areas have been taken over by farming, and now just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has negatively affected human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have relied on soups, porridges, and breads, leaving us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought to be a blessing of the New World, was actually a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. However, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gathering. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with its own challenges. Heights have increased, but the world hasn't adapted. Standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers are constantly updating their product ranges. The question is: where will it all end? We can't grow forever. There must be a natural limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, from the University, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies retain heat better.) Since the climate warmed, we have become slightly thinner and smaller, even with proper nutrition. As the planet continues to warm, we may shrink even more. In other words, human growth could be offset by global warming.'"

FCE_5,"Text: 'Onto a winner Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with bushy beards, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the ancient game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and introduced it to his family. Soon, the family was playing the game every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But they didn't forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, made from old wooden food crates, and continued to play regularly. Visitors were often fascinated by the game, as it was unknown in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed the old pichenotte board was cracked and worn, so he decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People there started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!' When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched and found its roots were likely in India, with a similar game called 'carroms'. It was adapted into 'squails' in Britain, and British emigrants brought it to Canada a century ago. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. Pichenotte, played by two to four people, is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks', which are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole scores 20 points. Three rings around the hole score 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight tiny posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts two minutes. Seeing its popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and started producing boards. Over 450 have been made so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to withstand lots of use.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will one day house a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they're happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will make them successful.'"
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a piece of waste ground, flat and covered with brambles. For years, it was seen as useless land. However, with careful planning and hard work, one man, with the constant support of his wife, transformed it into the masterpiece you see today. Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat site into the sculptured landscape you see now. Bulldozers and digging machines helped, but a lot of hard work was also needed. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower-beds, and rockeries.

Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be carefully chosen to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds in this exposed location. Most plants came from local garden centres, but some were brought from as far as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims, who made over 100 models over nine years since the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics to withstand all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself. You will notice that a constant scale is used, and even the smallest details are carefully crafted. This was achieved through patience and unique construction techniques.

The Model Village is a popular attraction, known for its high-quality workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been applied in other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses on modelling. All the model buildings show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on one specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small accident can lead to hours of repair work. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to make the models operate.

At the end of your visit, we welcome any comments you might have. New models are always being planned, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models do not meet the village's standards, as we are constantly updating and replacing them. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it."
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish photos that invade people's privacy and break the editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. Usually, these photos cause great harm to public figures when their private moments appear on the front page. However, very few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization set up to handle such issues. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. Do intimate photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos and, since she was in a hotelâ€”a place where, according to the code of practice, 'there is a reasonable expectation of privacy'â€”she had a valid reason to complain, but she didn't take action. It is scandalous that the PCC did not investigate on its own. It should also look into the recent outrageous story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on these and other shameful attacks? Initially, this seems like a good idea. It would likely result in many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would no longer be financially viable to spend their days hiding to capture unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still refused, should it proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royalty might expect any story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the role is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor the entire British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there is the embarrassment factor. No matter how seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they want the further embarrassment of an investigation? Most people likely want to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they realize it could become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. One British comedian also suffered from the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'fury', claiming it was just a bit of fun and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Many college graduates receive advice about their first job. This article focuses on moving to a second job. We are not discussing those seeking a temporary job while looking for a permanent one, or those leaving an unsatisfactory job within the first few weeks. Instead, we are talking about those taking a significant step in their career, choosing a job that aligns with their ambitions after gaining some experience and skills. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. Consider if you want to specialize in a specific area, move up to higher responsibilities, or transition into a broader field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. Plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next position. It should show evidence of serious career planning. Most importantly, it should challenge you, help you grow, and give you more responsibility. If you feel like traveling, now is the time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again soon. Juliette Davidson spent her first year after graduating from St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors. It was a great first job because they were supportive. She learned about office work and improved her word processing skills. However, there was no room for advancement. One day, she resigned, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years, I have become more capable, and my job has really expanded,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to develop me. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. I have moved from mainly typing and phone work to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. I also deal with various inquiries, from chairmen of large companies to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda involves me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,"**Confident People: What's Their Secret?**

Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but many say it's a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**

When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At 25, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I didn't think I could do it, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

**B. Michaela**

Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive, thinking that's what confidence was. I learned that to be confident, you need to believe in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don't feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lose confidence, so I talk to myself to overcome it.

**C. Lisa**

People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. In TV, looking confident is crucial. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous in important situations, and we feel better when talking to someone friendly. My mother once told me, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves."" I remember this advice. You gain confidence by facing fears. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed and felt less scared afterward.

**D. Barbara**

My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but it took years to build. By learning from mistakes, you become more confident. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You need to like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses that boost my self-esteem. They also encourage setting achievable goals. It's better to achieve small goals than aim too high and get nothing.

**E. Kim**

After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak in meetings. Eventually, I gained the confidence to share my opinions. When I started in politics, I was nervous about speaking in public. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing notes helped me feel more secure. Everyone feels a bit nervous speaking publicly. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,"Text: 'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled as I gave him his torn kite. 'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and I have many more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them under the shade of the coniferous trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, watching Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the center of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a row of competitors holding their kite lines waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites soared into the sky. Over 500 men and boys had registered for the five-day competition. Each entered four different designs judged on decoration, stability, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them requires real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how it's done.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As it got dark, he invited me to return the next day to rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur into mountains covered with rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to ferry people across. Nearby, a sign pointed up a path into the forest: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' It would have been helpful to know that most of this path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and bamboo huts. I decided to stay, ignoring the thought of insects under my mattress. The night was pitch black, filled with sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a stunning view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained heavily. Wind and lightning hit the treetops, and I got soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car being swept away and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I remember it more for its kindness.'"
FCE_48,"**What kind of shopper are you?**

Whether you love it or hate it, everyone goes shopping. But there are different types of shoppers. Do you know which type you are? Abby Edwards asked some people ...

**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**

I'm a shopping addictâ€”I can't spend enough money! When I have cash, I'm out shopping, and it keeps me happy. I find it hard to ignore sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're an addicted couple!

**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**

I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband the real amountâ€”I always say I spent less! The real price always sounds shocking.

**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**

I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring, and there's always something I'd rather be doing.

**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**

I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and get in and out quickly. I do have some mistakes hidden in my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes gets it wrong!

**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**

I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and disorganized, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish quickly!

**F. Lisa, 22, actress**

I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my girlfriends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it.

**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**

I'm a careful shopperâ€”I like going, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and rarely go overboard. Sometimes I shop to cheer myself up, but I often feel worse because I've spent too much!

**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**

I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want, and I never buy things immediately. I have to check other shops for better dealsâ€”I take ages!

**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**

I'm an unwilling shopperâ€”maybe because I work in the city center, the shops have lost their appeal for me. When I have to shop, I drag myself out, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than put in a lot of effort shopping!"

Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer questions about them. The quiz sheets are available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**

The Gallery has acquired a still life by Dutch 18th-century painter Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is in light, bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778, as the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons. This picture was donated by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy and is now on display in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently acquired works by three Spanish painters of this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

**Lecture News**

A series of lectures accompanies the special exhibition every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often ""tell a story"" through their pictures.

The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food.

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the euro are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green the farmer would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies eventually started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

They are the only flowering plants that can survive in the freezing conditions of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands support many kinds of animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way. Grass grows back quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live in one area. Once they have eaten all the grass, new grass starts to grow, providing a fresh meal."

PET_49,"Text: 'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm northern coast through endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, although the food is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship, would save time and money. A transcontinental railway is rare, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, everyone seemed excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners eager to board. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the Ghan waited four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip up the gorge. I left the train at Alice Springs for a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.'"
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is so far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and my first big winter climb. We took a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's 600 meters up, probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard it's like walking on ice. Even though some of us were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, including lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, we still felt nervous when we started. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon got steeper, and my legs felt heavy. Being the weakest in the group, I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they set off again. I promised myself that in the future, I would always train properly before a climb. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the route to the top of Ben Nevis. It's only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops away hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and all the way to the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, we weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down. On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as challenging as going up. You need to read a map properly because a wrong turn could lead to slopes too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns doing that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. However, this new school is one of the first in my country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched the whole process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, although it meant losing some lovely open space. The noise from the machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are much bigger than those in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings and other events. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and large changing rooms that we can't wait to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you'll notice there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from usâ€”the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in. When we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is the tree on the school roof. The builders put it there because it's a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that you can see it from miles away! We took pictures to put on our website.

Even though we're using the school building now, some parts are still being added. For example, we're putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We're so happy with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn much faster here!"

Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't luxurious, but it had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would do. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally emergedâ€”covered in mud but thrilled with what we had accomplished.'"

PET_60,"Text: 'Sharks Sharks are some of the most fearsome creatures in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that they eat. Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For instance, unlike other fish, most sharks need to swim constantly to breathe and stay alive, so they rarely sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to study sharks. It helps them learn more about these fascinating animals.'"

At my first ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around and asked me questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they started speaking in English, so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once to talk to her because I felt a little lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are very challenging, and I eat a lot to keep up my energy. This makes me confident that I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10Â°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy. At the moment, we are preparing for a new production, and there's also a competition for young dancers that I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"Text: 'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to see the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice. By the late 1980s, people started to see the dark and cold winter as an opportunity. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide. When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and new parts open each week until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date can change depending on the weather. In spring, the hotel melts as it gets warmer. Inside the hotel, the temperature stays between -5Â°C and -8Â°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Winter clothing like warm overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests are also advised to bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks, and to wear shoes larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and the equipment you need when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

The store's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the store said: 'The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly filled up, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space inside. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. What surprised me was that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store. This completely blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained the situation. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. She had gone deeper the previous year but used a balloon to help her ascend. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the only woman in any sport to break a man's world record. A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. Despite reports of serious accidents involving other divers, some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya disagrees, emphasizing that safety and training are crucial. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine remains consistent. She spends two-thirds of her time on land-based training at the gym, with the rest split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, preferring fast walking to build fitness. When she starts practice dives, she usually travels away from home, aiming for fourteen dives over four weeks, with rest days in between to avoid fatigue. When not preparing for an event, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects or films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. Tanya says her life today is like living her childhood dreams. Known in some countries, she believes people listen to her on environmental issues. Looking ahead, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she started free-diving at twenty-five, she emphasizes that she doesn't plan to retire from the sport anytime soon.'"

With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the late 1970s, the cinema industry thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors had some original ideas. They showed it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was a success. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again.'"

There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey is usually milder in taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweetener because sugar was very rare.

PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had become one of England's largest towns. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself independently.

Today, Norwich is relatively small compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was England's second-largest city. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as weeks in the year and as many pubs as days in the year. Although there are fewer churches and pubs now, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich in 1964. With a growing student population and success as a commercial center, Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries,' with green and yellow colors, though the origin of the name is unclear.

A modern shopping center, 'The Castle Mall,' is one of the city's attractions. For over two years, residents lived with a large hole in the city center as builders removed nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the Mall's roof, featuring water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are thriving, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the old with the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a desert city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about a dozen hot-air balloons launching from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown significantly. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots stay in radio contact and light up their balloons' burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. To see these 'glows,' you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Alternatively, you can take a cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival entrance. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you use film, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night photos."

Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take students at three and four, but she often makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts an hour, once every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also need to attend the classes. It is important that the parents show interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says that her method is not meant to produce great violinists, and she always suggests that students who perform particularly well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."

From the first song, which is a dance tune, it's clear the band is moving away from slow songs. The second track is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later tracks are in the band's usual slow style. These two tracks will surprise many fans, but they could easily become hit singles because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows his talent by hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems, which led to the band canceling their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets need not worry as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create perfect music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the upbeat ones that make you want to dance.

It was only 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be handmade, but now, although some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are produced by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to make large quantities of cheaper shoes for more people.'"
PET_20,"Text: 'No Title When I hurt my back, I had to pause my running career. I wanted to help more women discover the sport, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to boost their confidence to start running. So, I started a women's running club in my area because I was frustrated with many race organisers. They often complain about the lack of women in the sport but use it as an excuse not to provide separate changing facilities. I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. They were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't think about chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they ran for only a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and staying fit. I wanted to support women's running, and I've enjoyed watching their progress almost as much as they have.'"
PET_40,"Text: 'THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, meaning 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During summer, supplies could reach these towns by boat, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, blocking access. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This trail was named the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to cross Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' for rest and food. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams. However, in 1925, dogs were needed again when diphtheria struck Nome. The cure was in Anchorage, far across Alaska. Airplanes were new and untested in such cold, and the only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail, and took twenty teams just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers, relying on his dog Togo to guide him through the snow. The final part was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, an experienced dog team driver. His lead dog, Balto, refused to move at one point, saving the team from icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Today, a dog sled race is held annually from Anchorage to Nome, following the 1925 route. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.'"

You can even have a wedding there if you wish. The bar is also made of ice, so placing hot drinks on it is not a good idea! The bedrooms are kept at around -4Â°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to stay warm. If needed, suitable outdoor clothing is also available.

'At first, no one minded that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who had supported other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her playing football outside the club. He quickly noticed she was very fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was really hard work and my legs hurt a lot.' But Jose visited her parents and convinced them that she could succeed and help lift them out of poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an offer to train in the United States. She had refused before because she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She says, 'They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent and I learned a lot.' Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother.'"

However, not everyone agrees with the idea of zoos. Supporters say zoos allow us to learn about the natural world and see wild animals up close, which wouldn't be possible otherwise. On the other hand, critics argue that it is wrong to keep animals in cages and that poorly managed zoos can have dirty conditions and provide unsuitable food for the animals.'"

Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was impressive, especially since everyone was so young. Players from each band even created new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played! We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets acceptedâ€”only about half do. However, anyone eager to play attends jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the countryâ€”Iâ€™ve been to a couple and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for serious music students like me. I find jazz exciting because it's both new and old at the same timeâ€”you can create your own music, but you also feel connected to its history, playing on stage like the great jazz performers before you. My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn't get far with our music!'"

However, it doesn't rain often, and when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods, turning streets into rivers. Recently, many winters have been dry, so when it rains, the local people are happy. Marrakesh's parks and gardens don't rely on rain. Instead, they depend on a network of underground channels, built in the 11th century, that bring water from the mountains all year. These dry places that get water this way are called oases. Further south from Marrakesh is Skoura. Here, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, covered in snow during winter, provide a beautiful background.'"

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights offers tours in a full-size passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Questions**

Here are answers to common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. Around four hours into the journey, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have lived on research stations in Antarctica give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera near the pilot, connected to the onboard video system, provides a pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, passengers switch to the seat on their second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over points of interest so that everyone can see the sights well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain checks the satellite cloud images on the morning of the flight and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them in detail. We do not land on Antarctica, mainly for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes, definitely! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun onboard photo opportunities where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

These weekly lessons are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay Â£280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. Bill, a ten-year-old class member, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter driving is dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. The car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, whenever you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, triple on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law, but instead, he went to art school. There, he found traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued painting. In his late twenties, he received a grant from the Italian government to study art, which sparked his interest in early Italian artists. This influence is visible in some of his work. He admired the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. To achieve this, he painted colors thinly, layering them from light to dark, but he admits he's never sure of the outcome. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he never makes drawings before starting a painting, as he believes that if he did, he might lose interest and not complete the painting. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he prefers models who don't ask to see their pictures while he's working. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he has not felt connected to the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."
PET_38,"Text: 'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against the idea because of the noise. Ben argued, 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our home with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. I must admit that, although their music sounds a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This school is unique because it offers students valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with their regular studies. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They study in the mornings and spend the afternoons doing useful activities like helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is its diverse student body, with students from various social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are PS20,000 for two years, many students receive grants. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them can attend only because they get government support.

""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education using methods that truly work."

I felt trapped in the job and became more and more unhappy. I envied the students at the local university, who seemed happy, carefree, and hopeful, and I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I'm a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am grateful for this chance to study because I know a qualification is necessary for a fulfilling job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out partying. There are also typical student benefits like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I often wonder what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage has been a wise decision.'"

However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She owns 50 sheep, and each one produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to prevent them from getting too warm. 

Five years ago, Jenny decided to make sweaters from the wool and sell them at country markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people weren't interested in buying sweaters. So, she started making socks instead. The socks became popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This marked the beginning of Jenny's business.

He mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave without closing a door or window. He added that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually home then. However, he noted that winter afternoons are ideal for burglars because it is dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Many houses are empty at this time since people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to watch over other houses on the street when people are away and to call the police if they notice anything unusual.

However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, and their villages gradually expanded. Some villagers could focus on other tasks, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was challenging during bad weather, leading to food shortages. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it is transported thousands of kilometers to reach our homes.'"

In the past, farmers spent a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Now, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even get weather updates on their mobile phones. Today, many people still believe in traditional weather sayings. For example, they say that if there is a red sky in the evening, the next day will be sunny. Some also believe that when cows lie down in the fields, it will rain soon.'"
KET_49,"Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from a small Canadian town. They have always been friends and classmates. Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because of homework. They have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who had trouble with reading. Kevin learns words better by seeing pictures and hearing information than by reading. Frazer wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to create the game, and now it's ready to use. It's a speaking and picture game. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there's a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their game, and it will soon be available worldwide. Many schools are interested in buying it."

KET_58,"Text: 'Bollywood' is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, surpassing the USA. Watching films is the most popular leisure activity in India, with ten million people going to the cinema daily. Bollywood films often feature romantic love stories, with singing and dancing as key elements. These films are also popular outside India, earning Bollywood over $500 million last year from international sales. Indian actors make more films annually than their Hollywood counterparts, but they earn less money. As a result, most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to produce, whereas a Hollywood film typically costs at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work intensely for a few years. However, Amitabh Bachchan, considered by some as India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in over 140 films during a career spanning nearly 40 years."

It's very different from my life in the U.S. when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars, and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was nice because I didn't have to pay any bills.

In 1750, Henry Fielding started paying a group to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown very large and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was created with 3000 officers. Most worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are well paid, and for the few who still ride horses, the pay is even better.'"

They build small wooden huts on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these huts, they fish for the fish swimming under the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,' he says. 'First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then, you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long.

Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of large white cards. Each elephant received a paintbrush and began painting on its card. Occasionally, the keepers gave them new brushes with fresh paint and took the old ones away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures. I was amazed! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one.

Many people send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, and it showed a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards began to feature images of current events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures at that time.'"

Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs varied greatly in appearance. There were over 5000 different species. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and was a plant-eater. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as large, but it was more powerful. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast due to its long back legs.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can kill a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well and, like most animals, they find food using their noses. There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other in Southeast Asia. Not all black bears are black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear from China. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard to find food.'"
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in tropical areas around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water but can move quickly both in water and on land. Crocodiles are often seen in large groups. They eat anything they catch, including fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat large animals or people. There are over ten different types of crocodiles, all with very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth but grow new ones quickly. Most crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. Crocodiles can live for many years; the oldest one in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"Text: 'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes changed significantly. In the 1950s, they became much faster due to jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world, flying at 2500 kilometers per hour, making the trip from London to New York only four hours long. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people got cold and wet in bad weather. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to watch William Shakespeare's plays. All the actors were men at that time. Visitors ate, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"
KET_48,"Text: 'Dear Jeff, I'm having a great holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better, and we go to the beach every day. This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we will visit the Great Barrier Reef. The water there is warm, and I love swimming. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home! See you at the end of September. Sue'"
