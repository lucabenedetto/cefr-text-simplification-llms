CPE_15,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. However, it might not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Households pay for it through local taxes, but the amount they pay doesn't depend on how much rubbish they produce. This means that families producing a lot of rubbish pay the same as those producing little. The cost of rubbish disposal is not zero; more rubbish means more collectors, trucks, and landfill fees. Economists suggest that charging households for the exact amount of rubbish they produce could encourage them to throw away less and recycle more. 

Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, studied this idea and found unexpected results. They looked at several American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common system involved selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags were collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, residents were charged 80 cents per tagged bag. While the number of bags decreased by 37%, this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a tactic known as the 'Seattle stomp'. The actual weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, the weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying, which might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

On a positive note, recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling voluntarily. In a broader study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that while pricing does reduce rubbish weight, the effect is small. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is because reducing rubbish significantly would require people to buy less of almost everything, and a small fee is unlikely to change that. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. Wealthier towns produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling. 

So, should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are needed to understand these effects, and sometimes the results are not as expected."
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might evolve. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Career success alone is no longer enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even successful individuals often feel bitterness behind their fame. Loving your work used to be enough to be envied, but now you must consider how your job affects you personally—your mind, character, and relationships. This is crucial. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you dull, unable to engage with others outside your field, or too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination and humor, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.

I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment, rather than shaping us to fit industrial needs, and how it can be redesigned to suit everyone, both women and men. Work should not just create wealth but offer a fulfilling lifestyle, help discover hidden talents, and provide diverse human interactions. However, this change doesn't mean eliminating unemployment. As people become more educated, they seek jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A career should be seen as a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class professions no longer have the appeal they once did. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, the companies and institutions they work for are downsizing. Efforts like decentralized decision-making and performance-based rewards haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organization's.

I am investigating various occupations to see how they shape or harm those in them. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and how courage can be developed. I've applied this to major concerns like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts work on extending the life and income of organizations, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as human beings and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are part-time slaves, theoretically free to escape drudgery but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, used by others, working not to become better people but because we see no other choice?

Consider hotel workers, as 10% of the workforce is in the 'hospitality industry'. The unused potential is astonishing. Many intelligent and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the Ritz's 19th-century luxury model. A hotel is more than a place for travelers to sleep; it's a mini United Nations. People from around the world meet at hotels but usually pass in silence. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the students they employ, rather than assigning them only basic tasks. If they considered their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. But they are held back by accountants who say firms should focus on one core activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human, not just financial, perspective and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people want relationships based on independence rather than obedience, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This requires knowing how to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that may initially seem very different. Everyone understands the importance of communication, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation differs from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more intimate encounter, creating respect between participants and valued as a way to understand another person deeply, with the chance of being changed by the experience. It's more than relaxation; it's the most effective way to establish equality. Every time you have such a conversation, the world changes a little."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This agricultural metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest, assuming central resources are available for distribution. The question is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that made this metaphor seem fitting. Television, related to two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, was envisioned as a centralized 'mass' medium from its early days. This centralization matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. 

There were attempts to organize television differently, but they remained just that—attempts. Two notable alternatives highlight what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a potential telephone replacement. Popular science journals provided instructions for building TV transmitters and receivers, and enthusiasts were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that sidelined these grassroots efforts. Thus, the chance for a more egalitarian form of television communication was lost, at least in Britain.

Broadcasting was tied to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. Despite TV amateurs' activities, television was mainly a medium for public viewing in the USA and elsewhere in the early 1930s, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most early audiences experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was marginalized, systems based on public reception operated in several countries and posed a potential threat to the medium's domestication. However, this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets as prices dropped, and central broadcasting to homes became the most suitable organization of the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined 'consumer' society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as an entertainment center became achievable for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and broadcasting structures. As societies modernized, centralization of capital and political power increased, and traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, leaving them relatively isolated compared to earlier stable communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments efficiently reach citizens with important information and fostered a sense of national community.

Broadcasting became the dominant organization for radio and television due to these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to resources necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when buying things gets out of control. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message is often: if you don't have this, you're not good enough. To see how much you're influenced, try not to read any ads next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads condition us in persuasive ways without us realizing it. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves impact our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring caves requires physical agility, so cave research is often done by both professionals and amateurs who visit caves for sport. This creates a unique overlap between scientific and amateur studies.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the foundations of meteorology, which has evolved into today's technical science. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with endless weather data quickly, and computers solve complex calculations faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses complex terms that can be confusing to non-professionals. However, simple weather wisdom is still important. Human experience is crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. However, after working briefly at a national opera house, I realized that music is the primary focus in opera, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are central. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the performance starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken.

In musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a flawless orchestra is easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics match; we recognize that athletes are doing something similar to us running for a bus, but at a much higher level.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully understand an actor's skill and are not particularly impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually amazed when an actor delivers a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. However, it suggests that audiences and performers meet on more equal terms in theatre, regardless of how challenging or spectacular the material is.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it should, because a different approach can transform the concert-goer's experience. Live music is inherently theatrical, full of emotion and vulnerable to unexpected events, engaging the listener's imagination both individually and collectively. However, the conventions in music, like strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, often create an uncomfortable hierarchy between players and listeners. On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive solos, which can be insensitive to the work's overall integrity.

Is there a solution? Yes, much is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience where professional musicians' skills and generosity were central, and it was life-changing for many in the audience, who also contributed directly.

What I desire in music is more of the risk and radicalism that theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations, disrupting normal expectations. Such settings can have surprising effects on both performers and audiences. Comforts might be sacrificed, the acoustics might not be perfect, or it might be cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous in following artists into unlikely spaces. I acknowledge that most plays are staged in a conventional way, similar to concerts. However, I am convinced that something can and should change in music-going conventions. My only authority is that of an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to thrive and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I am not fond of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like plaster and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the moment you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk across a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days after, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more scatters around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

**Lock and Key**

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple beam behind the door has evolved into an electronic lock activated by a plastic card with countless combinations, but the desire to keep out intruders remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks with a digital command. But people don't like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I struggle to understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. Then again, you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and actually explained what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the original story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and narrative in a novel can be cut without losing the main point. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In stage drama, speech often mimics real conversation, sometimes using redundant language to create a certain effect. In some modern plays, this redundancy is so extreme that the dialogue seems to be just about maintaining contact between speakers, leaving the actual message unclear.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into another world, making you forget reality for a while. This experience feels separate from everyday life, and once the film ends, you return to the real world. In the past, movies were seen as mere entertainment, not art, by some older generations and teachers. They enjoyed being entertained but didn't consider films to be a serious art form.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but many rooms looked the same and were hard to find. The studio lacked a central focus, with three main entrances that were all similar, making it difficult for newcomers to navigate. However, strangers were rare, as the studio didn't encourage their presence. Employees, familiar with the layout, worked together to create films that offered audiences an escape from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookshops are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and launched his career. Rodriguez's success story is a modern example of dreams coming true quickly. In the past, filmmakers took time to mature, working in various roles before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city: rows of cramped, dull homes in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong sulphur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. Most of my early life is a blur. But I do remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, other memories appear—faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. It's no surprise that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, whose anger I never understood and couldn't calm. Even as a child, accompanying her to small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as on a moor. Her solitude was paired with a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and commands to 'behave properly'. This moral code was beyond my understanding: even now, I'm not sure I grasp it. Specifically, it meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting silently for long periods in the dining room, with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked; it meant countless rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said nothing except to agree with the main speaker, and Mrs. Laband—more lively than the others, whom they vaguely disapproved of. It was only later that I realized how poor this company was; they formed a sad and depressing group, with inconsequential talk about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy burden of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the duty to 'behave properly' weighed on my shoulders, and I felt I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at that time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way (I remember aimless days at about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat—extraordinary contraptions made of cast-iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I recall, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete once at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity—a kind of junior charity, I think—only for my mother to dismiss it, saying its organizers were 'only after your money'. Mercenary motives were a common theme in my mother's conversations, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons—and I'm not sure her mind could make such a leap—it was as a kind of luxurious post office where rich people opened letters stuffed with five-pound notes sent by a gullible public. No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I overlook her virtues and highlight her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it had all been drained from her. To be fair, my mother wasn't unaware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me—in my 'good clothes'—on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, hand-in-hand, cautious but mindful of the free admission, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely opposed to this activity and eventually almost formed opinions on the subjects presented. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to say, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I had known this side of the street since I was very young. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Even if I didn't know everyone by name, each house was distinct to me, like the little rain troughs in the cement that I used to skate over. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to reflect a slight drop in social status: porches were lower, and front yards smaller. Over time, changes occurred: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces with the lingering smells of merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space for practical and aesthetic reasons. In his previous home, living and working areas were combined, making it hard to separate work from personal life. So, he used a large sheet of corrugated plastic to divide the space, creating a hallway and leading the eye to the kitchen. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area for both social and work gatherings. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel, he used light wood for the floors and filled the flat with sentimental furniture from his parents and markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life as a nomad is a literary mystery. His life and work were full of secrets and sometimes lies, but he was a brilliant writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It combined the excitement of a thriller with the charm of romantic fiction. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction, altering reality for a better story. His book suggested that travel could uncover histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a midsummer rainstorm, I hurried across my lawn and took refuge in the pool. As I swam, each raindrop created a small fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the water. In the summer of 1996, I began to dream of a long swim through Britain, following the rain to the sea. I wanted to escape the monotony of swimming laps and explore beyond the familiar. In a world where everything is labeled and explained, activities like walking, cycling, and swimming help us reconnect with the wild and mysterious. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of the world that still hold mystery, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin believed that crying had no clear evolutionary purpose. He was likely mistaken. More recent studies suggest its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby noted that crying helps form the bond between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is less clear. The sound of crying seems less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social bonds. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing injustice. Tears can also come unexpectedly, sometimes embarrassingly, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, but this is more common when we are with others than alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? While many people understand the basics of global warming, its exact consequences remain uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change weather patterns worldwide. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are crucial.

The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the past century, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising concentrations are likely already affecting the climate, but our limited understanding of the global heat balance makes future predictions uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have fluctuated with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this trend is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.

Researchers use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze interactions between temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they are simplifications of reality and have limitations. Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we've experienced before. GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more frequent.

These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Climate changes could alter the locations of ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, and affect the species they contain. This would impact resources like food production, water, and human settlements. While some effects might be beneficial, many are likely to be harmful. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage. However, climate change could also reduce water availability, especially in arid regions or areas with existing shortages, like the Mediterranean Basin.

Another concern is changes to glacial processes, affecting ice and impacting vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic's ice cover might melt completely, facilitating marine transport and resource exploration but increasing iceberg risks. The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With half of the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences could be severe, leading to flooding and displacement. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face significant disruptions, and small island nations might disappear entirely, creating environmental refugees and cultural losses."

This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as fuel efficiency is crucial. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a challenging task, but the race is on to develop systems with new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never launches, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will lead to valuable advances for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Ironically, the very existence of art, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can sometimes hinder our understanding of it. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to and within our experiences. This misunderstanding can block our comprehension. Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that prevent new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets detached from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on real life. This separation builds a barrier around art, making its broader significance hard to grasp, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountain peaks are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, art theorists should show how art connects to life. If we accept this idea, even temporarily, we realize something surprising: to understand art, we must temporarily set it aside and focus on ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We need to approach art theory indirectly. Understanding art requires insight, much like understanding plants requires knowledge of soil, air, water, and sunlight. To grasp the aesthetic in its refined forms, we must start with raw experiences that capture our attention and provide enjoyment.

However, many people are put off by the idea that their everyday pleasures have an aesthetic quality. The arts that resonate most with people today are often not seen as art, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often share the misconception that art is separate from ordinary life. The times when special art objects are closely linked to everyday life are when appreciation for them is strongest."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular imagination, lions hunting for food are seen as a marvel of teamwork: at sunset, a group of stealthy cats emerges from the shadows like trained hunters and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. Lions appear to be the perfect social animals, working together towards a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of observing these creatures in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by the number of surviving offspring it produces, then cooperation might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this in two to three years. But lions are experts at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions. It has taken various research methods to uncover clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a milestone for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the style of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious angst, plain clothes, and loud guitars of the past; in came a lighter mix of melodic local styles. Social observation and strong emotions mixed easily with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, melancholic depths on tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a ballad that demanded attention. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, an unmatched record in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" those wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the last three for the full 300 gold pieces. I realized even then that there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I've never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I was interested in, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. In the end, I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to sort through it - the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior in the editorial department (under 18) or an experienced freelancer who comes in a few mornings a week. Neither has much influence, but they are on your side and looking for something original - the junior to make a name and acquire an author, the freelancer to justify continued employment. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a more senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales, and also consider if you seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Additionally, they will consider how promotable you are - an important factor when a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before finalizing the offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency during the early 1990s, you likely faced one of the toughest periods in your career. The recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in GDP, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and 75,000 homes repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with industries like vehicle and building trades experiencing a 30% downturn. Many people and companies across various countries suffered.

Advertising professionals were not unique in losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to support company profits while working with shrinking budgets. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began focusing more on producing goods and services that customers wanted, rather than what was convenient for them to provide. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was often seen as a cure-all solution, with about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising.

The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought a severe downturn. This was partly due to the economic climate, but also because clients began scrutinizing the value of advertising more closely. Without clear evidence of its benefits, many questioned the return on their investment. Advertising was under more scrutiny than ever before.

Clients demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant that advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession led to controversies over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for effective advertising.

Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad. These factors, combined with the economic situation, forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to increase the proportion of successful advertising was greater than ever.

Help for those wanting to improve their advertising was scarce. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to share their insights, and those who succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some information, but available books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which did not help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. Among my peers, this was an unusual choice. Cooking wasn't one of the prestigious jobs most of us aimed for. On the surface, it seemed like an unattractive profession. Chefs are known for having tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and poorly paid. However, these factors didn't deter me. I was unhappy at university. The academic work was challenging, and the social environment felt closed-off and pretentious. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from intellectual and social pretensions. It offered a seriousness and integrity that I found lacking in my college life. But my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an aesthetic ideal for me. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I dined at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still vividly remember my starter. I left that meal wanting to bow down, weeping, at the feet of the chef who created it. I felt warm and uplifted for days afterward. After this experience, I developed a strong desire to uncover the secrets of this fascinating art. I turned my student life into a long preparation for my entry into the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretense, distracting me from my true path. I gained my real education in a scattered and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and preparing elaborate meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced that move until the hour was up. On my next visit, he had me standing upright and diving off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes, I said!"" The following week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt as if I were wrapped in silence. I waved my arms vaguely as I'd been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he couldn't diminish my euphoria. ""That's what they mean by 'free as a bird',"" I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the phenomenon of the traveler is as puzzling as it is intriguing. These are people who have given in to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing the steep and icy face of an avalanche-prone mountain; who sail alone in fragile boats through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing more appetizing is available, and who can live, day and night for months on end, in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It's easy to dismiss such people as oddities—as indeed they are—to be categorized with the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or even writers. Their existence cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they inhabit lies far outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, glad that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like making a dangerous dash across a city street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his element, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is clearly a competent one. His main reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is sure to provide events and achievements for his pen to celebrate. Raban's small boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives sailors their position to within a few meters, anywhere on the earth's surface. Although he strongly approves of this instrument, there is more than a hint of primitivism in Raban's attitude toward other seafaring aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a ""fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea."" Raban argues that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus of the steersman's attention, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things happening in it, is now reduced to a mere space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long stretches by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer offers us two of life's great pleasures: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from different times or places because human experiences are universal. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings expressed with clarity and accuracy. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly articulated by authors, even if they are from distant places or times. We feel grateful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves better.

Reading and travel help us break free from routine. Our senses are most alert when we first arrive in a new place, similar to when we read a great book. Books make us notice things we previously ignored. Our minds become more aware of details like the sky's colors, a person's changing expressions, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't realize we felt.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were originally published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I've restored some small edits made by the editor to fit the page, but added little else. I've corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were factual errors I should have caught initially. While hindsight could improve the articles, that process would never end. For example, in a piece about China, I mentioned the stability of the Hong Kong dollar, which later fell. Rewriting it to predict this would be misleading, as I was simply reporting my observations at the time. Like any traveler, I was focused on understanding what had already happened, not predicting the future. Mass jet travel has opened the world to anyone with a ticket, and I believe my fellow travelers are not entirely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, ""ecotourism"" would win. The term emerged in the early 1980s, reflecting growing environmental awareness and travelers' desire to minimize their impact. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Today, ""ecotourism"" can describe anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip through a gorge. Any tour involving cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or mild adventure might be labeled ecotourism. The original intent was to help travelers make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a clear definition has left many confused.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost the notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it again by chance. It helped me reconstruct that time for this book, though it wasn't as detailed as I hoped. In Transylvania, I enjoyed a more relaxed experience than planned, staying in hospitable country houses for weeks. During these long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. When I resumed traveling, I often took brief notes instead of writing a full narrative. Concerned about possible errors when writing this book, I added disclaimers. But since this isn't a guidebook, I decided to let the story unfold naturally."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern trend, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians emphasize that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have been developed, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For instance, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers competing for new manuscripts have given a misleading idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The wisest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, are literary odd-jobbers, getting by with some teaching, occasional workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of writing opportunities at a chocolate factory, but I've never had such luck. Still, by juggling part-time jobs, credit cards, and often with the help of those mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were playing at across the country started selling out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing crowds of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we performed to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Although I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam explores their impact on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we saw more ways to listen to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia techniques. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. Access to music is likely to keep growing, as it meets many human needs. National events always include music, and for individuals, it offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is unimaginable. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind it will be, and if people will still want to learn musical instruments. I believe they will. The music industry is a major income source in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media. Besides its job importance, evidence shows that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. While these findings need more support, European data shows that group music lessons can improve social relationships in school and concentration in young children and those with behavioral issues. Further research is exploring if playing an instrument can develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice might help with good study habits and focus, and playing in concerts might encourage punctuality and organization. For these reasons, there will likely be a demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a shift in focus, and if so, in what direction? I see two likely possibilities. First, the music people listen to will become more diverse, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making composition more accessible as it will rely less on technical skill. However, this might further reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on them. Alongside this trend, more people of all ages will likely want to participate in music-making, often in community settings reflecting local musical traditions.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to adapt. Instrumental teaching must change to allow more people to learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will impact the curriculum and assessment methods, which must adapt to stay relevant for a wider audience, covering a broader range of musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They must motivate, inspire, and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a significant shift from traditional practices and will require responding to public accountability demands. Positively, this offers a chance for music educators to showcase the high quality of music tuition available.

Finally, we must raise the profile of music itself. Music is vital in our lives but often taken for granted. Those in the music profession at all levels need to work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors often face criticism and mockery. This negativity is sometimes their own doing, especially when they are required to discuss their craft in interviews. They could take inspiration from the dancer Pavlova, who, when asked to explain her dance, replied, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often fall into using clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend, saying that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when performed. Discussing it makes it theoretical and empty. Acting has no strict rules, except perhaps being audible. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning anew from the characters and the writer's insights. Once a play ends, they feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet balances between youth and adulthood, delivering a performance that is both simple and assured. His mastery of the text and his control over his body and mind elevate him to a top-tier actor. Lester plays a tense, edgy young man, driven by a hidden anger, yet he uses sharp wit and humor to make himself both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtly virtuosic. Notice how his arms hang stiffly, suggesting a figure ready to come to life. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives a similar impression of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or an evocation of real behavior? What animates these bodies, both morally and physically? This is a central question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors sit quietly, absorbing the words' effects. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, wait for the impulse to speak, and then speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought settle, and visualize a memory or scene. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from external or internal sources. Actors should look into the eyes of their scene partner and consider their character's situation. ""Dropping in"" is about discovering what's happening without pre-planning or judging. Actors should approach it with an open mind, trusting that something will occur.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's disheartening if the staff treats it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No audience member should feel they have a poor view of the actor. It's important that they are close enough to hear, see, and feel connected to the stage. The auditorium's design is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the human form, it's flawed because drama centers on the human experience. Many late nineteenth-century theatres got this right, shaping auditoriums that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, which suggest layers of human presence. Regarding plays, you can't cater to everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want. When visiting the theatre, you seek something unimaginable, otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly a youth movement, but its true significance was in how it affected the middle class and older generations. It also set the stage for future rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing it would be a part of their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this exciting new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many aspiring rock stars. Like young John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, the only European station playing rock and roll, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to making his own music.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow beneath me gave way. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between two rocks, which had melted away. I climbed out, shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess my situation. In an hour, I had only covered half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While they often discuss data collection, they usually don't explain how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers do this. So, we asked various social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about their methods. The goal was to share insights into the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook. This involves making hidden processes more visible. Although this seems simple, it is quite complex. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth, trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. His answer was, not much. There's a trend to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning through a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program and his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" the father said. Television, as my son and his noodles show, is an impressionistic medium. Research indicates that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs to be guided. While new technology can be useful for teaching, formal education still plays a crucial role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals were unhappy, seeing their Los Angeles suburb changed by newcomers. But eventually, they accepted the success that came with it. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood recognizes a good film: one that might make a star, but will definitely make money. In less than a century, Hollywood transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it remains a village—focused on films and gossip. Those who succeed often try to live elsewhere but work there. Still, it is the place where everyone in show-business eventually comes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new art form. They wanted a lasting, accurate record of their surroundings and found it. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and chemicals produced images more detailed than paintings. This worried other artists, and critics argued that photography wasn't true art. They claimed it was too tied to reality and mechanical processes. Despite this, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of expression. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils—to interpret the world and present their vision of nature and people.

**Book Illustration**

In the era of black-and-white book illustration, every children's book needed illustrations. This included novels for older readers, which saw fewer illustrations as print runs decreased. Children's publishing was active but often low-budget, leading to routine work. However, the best artists always delivered high-quality work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of junk and treasure, great for research or browsing. The true treasures are returning to public view through reissues and exhibitions. After a period of neglect, there's renewed interest in this artistic period. Publishers may soon see the potential for classic children's book illustrations from this time, either in reprints or new editions using original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins—announcing your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing awareness of the potential downsides of sharing everything online. The internet offers vast opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we might get lost. 

Is this depressing? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame—long before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. After all, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was known then, mostly used by students and scientists. The web was invented at CERN in Switzerland for researchers to share work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, attracting readers with his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was exhibitionist, his work had a rigor and beauty that could be considered art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" His story unfolded; he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the dilemma remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people want to be with you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent her blog's address to company executives, including those she had mocked, leading to her dismissal. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online we wouldn't say in person. But our digital and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Though upset by the experience, she stopped blogging for a while, got married, and restarted her blog focusing on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online indiscretion, she has mastered controlled self-revelation. Armstrong learned an important lesson: the web allows us to say anything, but that doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Tiredness is often said to be a common issue today. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also become more common. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans are chronically affected by sleep issues. In Britain, some popular novels feature insomniacs or are set in sleep-research labs. There is a growing interest in sleep: its patterns, benefits, and problems. A key concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up too early to avoid traffic.' Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He allowed participants to sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at an average of eight-and-a-quarter hours, showing they were catching up on lost sleep. In Europe, these ideas are tested at a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands. The lab has studied the effects of fatigue on sailors, airport noise on sleepers, and the dangers of tired driving. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering PS5 an hour. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab's focus is physical. In a dark room, a motorway simulator is set up with a car facing a large screen. Participants arrive at 2pm, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short or sleepless night. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Young men deny they will fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. Initially, he sits upright, eyes fixed on the road. Then he starts blinking, first briefly, then longer, with his head nodding. Each nod becomes heavier, and blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, unaware of what happened, but the car has veered off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups, even after no sleep, can make you a safe driver for over half an hour. She suggests using alertness products like tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers. But what do we really know about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they move through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually occur in the lightest sleep, and the brain paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, theories abound. Some suggest sleep repairs tissues, restores muscles, or rests the brain's frontal section. However, these might happen faster during relaxed wakefulness, so it's uncertain. Scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, though the reasons are unclear. When asked about sleep's purpose, some researchers say, 'Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm.' Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850, British people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke after midnight from their 'first sleep,' stayed awake for an hour, then had their 'morning sleep.' This time was used for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time activities. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daytime constraints. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich adopted a more efficient sleep pattern like today's. The industrial revolution extended work hours, reducing sleep for most people. Outside Europe and America, the old pattern persisted until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then wake up. Continuous sleep is not common. In some tribal societies, noise, fire supervision, and predator watch make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems people worldwide need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"Text: 'We are talking about big boots here. Really big boots. I stood in my $800 designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert. Money was no object. I wore the full cowboy outfit, but I wasn't a cowboy. It wasn't working. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and had to admit I wasn't at home on the range. Flying in from Denver just after dawn, I thought I might pass for a cowboy coming in from the sky. That feeling didn't last past the first real cowboy I saw at the Phoenix airport. He wore a sweat-stained T-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty canvas bag off the conveyor belt when he noticed my brand-new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and walked out without looking back. Somewhere, there should be a suit of clothes an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that makes him feel like he belongs, no matter where he is. I loved being a racing driver, driving racing cars. I'm addicted to it, and it's all I know how to do. But I don't do it anymore. I couldn't even if I wanted to. The question is, I thought, looking at the rust-colored mountains in the distance, what do I do now? A racing driver should have a backup plan for when he stops racing. I thought I did, but when I reached for them, they disappeared. How about: an ex-racing driver adds color to the commentary at the trackside? 'We have fifteen guys, all former Indy and Formula One drivers, ahead of you, Forrest, waiting to be commentators. We'll call you.' Well then, how about: an ex-racing driver starts a business selling classic cars? That lasted almost all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was the year nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was 'reviewing' its dealer list. So I withdrew before there was nothing left. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. I mean, do you really want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. Even if I had been world champion, you'd probably only listen for five minutes before getting bored. Last year's champion is last year. Not that I want sympathy. Which is good, because I don't get any. Why should I? I had a good run, made money, and kept enough. But oh, I miss the thrill of getting into that sleek, powerful machine with seven hundred horsepower behind me. Zero to one hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. And yes, I miss the danger of almost killing myself every race. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like what I said mattered. Being famous, even a little, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians bragged about knowing me. Little boys sneaked under fences for my autograph. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Only last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and time in the afternoon. And let me check, but I think tomorrow is free, so much empty time. I looked up at the soft blue sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little brown birds in a saguaro cactus in front of me were giving me advice, something like 'get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out'. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It did occur to me that a fake cowboy in designer boots had a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past decade, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, residents often walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you'll likely hear a different language with almost every step. People are drawn to Vancouver for its mild climate, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and educational and job opportunities. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that the influx of new residents and a thriving tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. Although this name is less common now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like myself, are often not great at writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing without getting paid, but I don't think we're that money-driven. It's more likely that, since we aim for maximum impact in our work, the natural spontaneity of a letter is lost on us. True creative artists, who don't consciously focus on the effect (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I believe that a true artist's understanding of the impact of their words is the only reliable test of their talent. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the contrast between long words made them effective, yet it showed his greatness as a writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, the opening of a new supermarket in Britain was a notable event. You could expect a soap opera star, a disc jockey, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Nowadays, new branches seem to open daily in many areas, making celebrities unnecessary. Why pay a famous person when anyone will do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy branch, as long as they were at the front. According to one customer who knew an employee, the first five men through the door would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly spread through the crowd, creating feelings of satisfaction among those at the front and envy among the latecomers."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the film's main character. Despite receiving mostly enthusiastic reviews, the film was not a commercial hit at first. It was television that later revived its popularity. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is especially remarkable because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles claimed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about filmmaking rules, so he simply did what he wanted. He had an exceptional team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he pursued it with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit unusual that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Both times, Carmel nodded in agreement but seemed distant, as if she hadn't fully understood. ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and replied, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing planned, so I might stroll downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost sinful to just idle away the day."" Dermot smiled back, ""You're entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she said.

**Title Race**

Tea boy? No, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.

Human nature provides the most amusing of comedies. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of envy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment consultancy found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey showed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our vanity is so strong that it surpasses even basic greed, we are indeed in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be seen as subordinate. The titles being discussed emphasize ability (like specialist or coordinator) but are often just euphemisms."
CPE_55,"I was in Vienna to take photographs. Photography was not just my job; it was a part of my life. I was always fascinated by how light fell on surfaces and how a single picture could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I was always searching for that perfect photograph, ready to capture it as long as I had film in my camera. This had been my approach for a long time. I once captured a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became famous worldwide. It was a moment of luck, but they say you make your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I went freelance, which seemed like a smart move, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties didn't turn out as successful as I had hoped, even after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad. 

The Vienna assignment came by chance. I had done the London photos for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The project gave me a good commission to capture my home city in different seasons. I had my own take on London, but I knew the best of my work might not be used. It was just a picture book, not meant to challenge perceptions. After finishing the London-in-winter photos, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job. They offered me the role because the Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available. Things at home weren't great, so I was happy to go. A week in snowy Vienna was appealing, and I didn't need it to be a compliment to my artistry. 

They put me up at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in a cold January, it was going to be different. I felt it as soon as I arrived and saw the city covered in snow. I was going to enjoy myself and take great pictures. The first day, I didn't take any photos. I rode the trams around the city, observing and absorbing the atmosphere. The weather was cold and set, like the grand baroque buildings of the city. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons because I wanted this to be my Vienna. I waited for the right moment to take my photos. 

The next morning, I was out at dawn. Fresh snow meant Stephansplatz was white and empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire reached into the sky, but at ground level, it was massive. I might have to settle for a partial shot, but it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality. In the past, people saw it as mysterious, even when they understood the chemistry behind it. Watching a photo develop in a dark room is still a magical experience. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something remarkable has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change wasn't due to a big-budget, heavily promoted show, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the past 60 years. The new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which is art focused on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move or explore movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in fascinating creative work of this century. Curator Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying this subject, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are presented with minimal text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some might be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and witty comments, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but this might be because being popular is not always seen as a good thing today. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to judge his work against an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and understands that only time will tell his true place in art history.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

Recently, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by their claim to be art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but complemented each other through contrast. I didn't make any grand statements about contemporary art, but perhaps there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it might spoil their experience. Some say art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the act of creativity. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from enjoying the dish. Understanding an artwork can enhance our enjoyment. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be examined. Our preferences are influenced by societal values, not just personal taste. While sensuous responses to art are important, the idea that intellect undermines them is outdated, from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It wasn't like a regular stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became popular. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which greatly improved their lives.

**St Ives**

We walked silently, carrying our bags down the winding, cobbled lane into the town center. We struggled against the strong wind and tried to avoid the icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track train. As the dark grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seemed like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to join me with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by open fires.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hardships are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas on past cultures. We can't replay history. However, computer modelling offers a solution. It allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital creations have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for their behavior and simulate social groups. Then, we can change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how these virtual societies react."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male in a nearby grove of trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking across open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**

In the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that, based on these figures, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals annually. However, this calculation is misleading. Most British cats live in towns, have smaller ranges, and catch less prey than the rural cats in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not devastating to Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are essential to marshmen and are well cared for. Each morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping spots, moving slowly and groaning, to reach the distant reed beds. They stand on the platform's edge, expressing their fatigue, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and may linger there, complaining softly. Their movements are so slow that they are barely noticeable, but eventually, they swim away, appearing almost submerged. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at eye level.

**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**

In early 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several fish still lifes. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and a pair of scales holding two or three soles. Despite their situation, the sea creatures appear alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors create a calm, underwater world. However, this calm is disturbed by an impending battle between the fish and the crab. The sharp forms of the fish and crab, along with the scales, suggest a sense of menace and hidden violence, giving the painting a symbolic depth."
CPE_12,"Photography Over the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all aspects of human life and activity. In this relatively short time, it has expanded its ability to record time and space, allowing us to see fleeting moments and visualize both the vast and the tiny. Photography has shown us images from remote parts of the world, distant areas of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has become one of the most important ways to express the human condition. However, the recording of events through images has a much longer history. The earliest pictorial recordings date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. Although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of early cave paintings—whether they recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious icons, or simply brightened domestic life—pictorial images seem deeply connected to human culture. Throughout history, questions have been raised about the accuracy of visual images and their status in society. The idea that 'seeing is believing' has always given special importance to visual images. So when photography was invented in the mid-19th century, its social and cultural impact was immense. Photography promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, functioning like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could provide a fixed image, closely resembling what we actually see. The chemical fixing of images allowed the capture of what might be considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, the photographic image was seen as a cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long struggled to create. Ironically, because of the camera's perceived realism, it was assumed that everyone would naturally understand photographs. This led to the question of whether photography was a 'universal language'. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander expressed this view, saying even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the heavens. However, with the rapid increase in global communications in the late 20th century, we need to ask to what extent photographic images can cross cultural differences in understanding. Is photography as bound by cultural conventions as language? Is it possible that our familiarity with photographs has led us to overlook the medium's ability to convey vivid impressions of 'reality'? Photography is often seen as providing convincing pictorial evidence, making the medium seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, 'this is my grandson'. Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This may be because photography has moved into 'mythic time'—its initial role as a 19th-century record-keeper has now moved beyond the human scale. Photographic images, once immediate and close to photographer and subject, have now become historical documents, revealing as much about the society that produced them as about their subjects. The camera is not just a passive recorder of events, and photography does not merely reflect culture. It can provide vision and drive social and political change. For example, the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance were influenced by the development of perspective, which brought new visual representation methods. Similarly, photography has contributed to the media culture of our era and has played a role in bringing the world's harsh realities to the coffee table."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry is like navigating a minefield: you need spontaneity, but one wrong move can disrupt everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners focus on reading widely, writing a lot, and freeing their imagination and spirit, without descending into chaos. Some people need stability to write, while others find inspiration in difficult times. Some follow a schedule; others wait for inspiration. All approaches are valid as long as they are not just following a set formula. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there is no space for too many characters or lengthy narratives. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify an issue. A character's memory can effectively move the story forward, but it should never slow down the action. Dialogue is more useful than many writers realize, as it can present different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but brevity should not reduce it to a mere summary. Conflict and action must be as strong as in a novel, but every word must count in a short story.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Many chess players move without knowing the outcome, seeing only a few moves ahead. Over time, they realize that chess relies more on long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the game as a whole, noticing patterns like openings, middle games, and end games. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin noted that humans have an instinct to speak, but not to write. Language is universal across societies, but writing systems have been invented only a few times in history. Languages change but do not become more complex. All children learn to speak without formal lessons, but writing is a skill that must be taught. Unlike language, writing is not instinctive and requires effort to learn. Understanding how writing works and how children learn it is crucial for teaching it effectively."
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to name it. I have little story to tell, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is made up of my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between. I could invent details to fill the gaps and make the story more coherent, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story made-up names, and I've taken care to ensure no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about is not famous. He might never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. Then, if my book is read at all, it will be for its own interest. But perhaps his chosen way of life and his unique character might influence others, so that, long after his death, people might realize a remarkable person lived in this age. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for my friend's biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I've recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I've put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but I've taken the liberty, like historians do, to put words into the mouths of people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I've done this to make the scenes lively and realistic, as they would be dull if just recounted. I want to be read, and I think I'm justified in making my book engaging. The intelligent reader will easily see where I've used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason for my hesitation in writing this book is that the people I write about are from another culture. It's very hard to truly know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not just themselves; they are also shaped by where they were born, the homes they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another nation except by observing them, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I've done so in short stories, it's because you can treat characters more briefly there. You give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I see them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the literary world often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It's only later that patterns and rankings become clear. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many styles, debates, and ideas about the poet's role in society. Generally, there is a divide between 'literary' poets, who write for reading, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their work. However, this division isn't strict. Public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, from small town halls to schools and arts festivals.

For 'pop' poets, who write for live audiences, public performances are beneficial. Their work is simple and easy to understand when heard. However, on the page, their work may seem less impressive. In contrast, poets dedicated to traditional craft, who aim to pack deep meaning and rhythm into their work, may not be fully appreciated in a single hearing. They might feel pressured to read their simpler works to connect with the audience quickly.

Listening to poetry readings is not a replacement for reading poetry, but it can be a helpful addition. Hearing poets read their work can show where emphasis should be placed, but it's best if the audience has the text or knows the poems beforehand. The main benefit of popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is that they make poetry enjoyable and accessible, not just for a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's unrealistic to think that someone's account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses the informant and the topic, and even if they just listen, their presence affects how the informant remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status compared to the informant and the way the historian has learned to interpret history, which might influence the informant. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the informant's memories are not directly connected to the past. Memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or altered by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes in the testimony can seem convincing but might be influenced by events after the period being discussed.

**Animal Science**

Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, such as how nerves and muscles work together to create behavior. The whole animal approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and the factors affecting it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are distinguished. Psychologists usually study learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behavior in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding nerve cell functions doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior at a broader level. Behavior has its own structure and units for study. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cell actions is like trying to read a book page with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face a dual challenge: learning the subject's content and its methodology. They must understand both the knowledge in textbooks and the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge, which is the subject's logical foundation. These elements are closely linked. While social life seems familiar from daily experiences, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on a specific aspect of social life, uses particular study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the subject's logical basis, allowing social scientists to surpass everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. Some of these terms have Greek origins, likely from earlier Greek sources now lost. Utility and function are not part of this definition, though Vitruvius later discusses the best forms for different structures. Initially, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins, with a long history of basic construction in Greece and Italy. These simple structures didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards but contributed essential elements to later architectural concepts. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. Despite this, Chen was amused when he found out. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided on a Monday at the start of the next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Meanwhile, Lily practiced driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

On the day of the trip, they left home and soon reached the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, even overtaking a few slow vehicles with great skill, which Mui, sitting in the back, had to admit. Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with empty parking bays, unsure of the road markings, and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. She locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked, ""No one will want that heap of tin."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He lifted Man Kee onto the railing and held him. Man Kee, warm and increasingly responsive, put his small hand on Chen's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way, ensuring he got a good education and grew up to own many restaurants.

The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It will take us back home when we're done here."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them. Chen said, ""Let your mother see, Son."" But Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and by the time he did, the ship was out of sight. All Lily could see was a circle of white light. When Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily only saw seagulls following the ship's wake."
CPE_43,"Text: 'THE WELL I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I hadn't considered how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle, but as soon as the bucket left the well's edge, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I hit my head. At that moment, I didn't realize I had, in a way, achieved my goal. I saw strange lights, like the stars and planets in cartoons when a character gets hit. I was first dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding more panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear alarmed voices from the castle. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur. Mother was frantic, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was horrified that no one had seen them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops glistened in the sunlight. Mother was screaming, a sound that shook me deeply. I realized this prank had gone too far and would lead to serious consequences. I regretted not thinking it through. From a clever plan to disaster in minutes. Desperate, I left my hiding place, pretending to be weak and disoriented. I cried out, then collapsed dramatically. Comforted by my weeping mother, I claimed I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and escaped through it. I thought I might get away with it until Father asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated, and his eyes narrowed. Trying to cover my lie, I said the tunnel had collapsed, making it pointless to search for it. Father looked at me with disbelief, as if seeing me for the first time. His words were filled with contempt. He walked away, leaving me with Arthur, who looked at me with pity and concern for my character. His silent rebuke was as painful as my father's words, making me realize the seriousness of my actions.'"

Susan, now a widow, is leaving her family home as her children have grown up. The moving van, labeled 'Removers of Distinction', was taking away everything that made the house unique. Fred, the removal man, with his large, gentle hands, was carefully packing fragile items, while his team was less gentle. The house was beautiful, a four-storey building with a view of a small harbour. Memories of her children growing up lingered in the air like dust. Susan recalled when Robert, at five, asked how they would bring the house home after buying it. Now an adult, Robert was helping with the move, ensuring Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also there, insisting she handle the Steinway piano herself.

Fred noted that Susan didn't seem like she would cry, which surprised her. He explained that people often cry when they see their home being dismantled, though they feel better at the new place. Susan could understand this. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their responsibility to notice any issues. The piano, a prized possession, was in the best room of the house and would be moved last.

Sitting on the stairs, as all the chairs were gone, Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano had been the first item brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for hours, and young Francesca was distraught, insisting they couldn't live without a piano. Her husband, Peter, had resolved the crisis by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano in. This process was costly, delaying the piano's tuning for months. Peter had declared the piano would stay forever, but forever is a long time. The children visited less often, and Susan found the stairs challenging.

As the movers prepared to take the piano, Susan felt anxious. Fred reassured her, and Robert and Francesca watched from the hallway. Susan was on the verge of tears, realizing how moving things made them significant. But when the piano was successfully moved out, they all burst into laughter, relieved. As they left the house arm in arm, Susan's only tears were from laughter."
CPE_11,"Text: 'Online Literary Criticism For Everyone

Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or start a music channel online. In practice, though, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that was truly opened to everyone was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try their hand at reviewing books. Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and rate a book up to five stars. This seemed like a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and new reviews appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, rather than just reading the publisher's blurb or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores with physical stores offered similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted the most reviews, and faced the most issues. This open review system led to various kinds of misuse. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily - Amazon wouldn't say exactly how many - so it was impractical to check them all. Instead, a team of editors reviewed the site, ensuring reviews followed the company's guidelines. Single-word reviews, personal attacks on the author, obscenities, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous (they didn't have to use their real names), and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon's editors noticed them. This left room for mischief. For example, writers could give their own books glowing reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was so upset by bad reviews of his first novel ('infantile trash', 'puerile pap') that he submitted several anonymous positive ones ('hilarious', 'fabulous') to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about his deception. The fake reviews were then removed. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link marked 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors used this feature to post friendly messages hoping readers would buy and enjoy their book. Some even shared their email addresses, inviting direct communication. However, Amazon did not verify that these comments truly came from the author, except for well-known writers. A little-known writer submitted a comment pretending to be from John Updike, admitting to being a 'talented but ultimately over-hyped middlebrow author'. Unsurprisingly, it was deemed fake and removed. Still, the real drama came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's We've Got Spirit, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well received by the mainstream press. But many people mentioned in it felt betrayed, and Amazon's page for the book became an outlet for their anger. Dozens of critical reviews were submitted, only to disappear a few days later. Despite this, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. Since readers' reviews were meant to be a 'forum to talk about a book' rather than a chat room, a close watch was kept on bestselling books to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page for a less well-known book. The Story about Ping, a classic children's book about a duck named Ping, inspired much geek humor because 'ping' is also a software utility used to measure Internet congestion. One long review drew an elaborate analogy between the book's plot and Internet architecture, concluding that the book provided a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts. Such silliness was rare. Most reader reviews on Amazon.com were taken seriously by their writers. Overall, the reviews gave a remarkably accurate indication of whether a particular book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once complained that 'reviewing too many books involved constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever'. This makes the democratization of the review process seem like a good thing.'"
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

Over the last two hundred years, we have started to believe that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. We praise art for being unique, revolutionary, and even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often voices these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in modern art. We see artists as separate from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that cannot be contained by conventions. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, integrating it into their daily lives. Today, we leave artists to their own devices and get annoyed if they try to step down from their creative heights.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book. The text questions the diversity of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the chosen text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any flashy or charming effects. The sign painter completes the task. My crucial question is: Is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

In the art world, it is often expected that once a painter finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and attempts to change direction are often met with disappointment. Gallery owners prefer safe bets, and the art-buying public may find comfort in continuity. However, some artists break this mold and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist challenging expectations. His new show moves away from the still lifes that made him famous to paintings of the London Underground. Railways have always fascinated Rimmington. After drawing the railway land of London's Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, he logically moved underground to explore what happens below. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings capturing the unique magic of this underground world designed for people in transit.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word 'escape' because the villagers jokingly say only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes from the village each day to clean the house, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke of the uselessness of art but did not mention its consolations. The comfort of my work as a painter or writer lies in the ability to reorder and rework reality, revealing its significant side. Our everyday actions are like a sackcloth covering the cloth-of-gold, the true meaning of the pattern. For artists, art offers a joyful compromise with all that has hurt or defeated us in daily life. It allows us to fulfill our destiny through imagination, rather than evading it like ordinary people. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"Text: 'Family Business'

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the posh girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. After a long talk with my headteacher, we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually very talkative. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you'll get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be bold. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about such things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died early in my childhood, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got into the habit of taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations and encounters.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on the safer tasks. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt poised, confident, concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or was he somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his hour of need. That was not all. As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever his single-mindedness -- the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his dynamic energy, his perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being extremely careful with their money, which made it a poor decision. Initially, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had been successful in his legal cases, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency shortly after their twins were born, receiving a raise to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat was too small for a family and that they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address, Mornington Mansions, was not suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport, and since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube. This commute left him feeling resentful and thinking about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had fond memories of being cared for after a long day. His grandmother had been a supportive 'lawyer's wife,' but times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his, and their lifestyle depended on both their incomes.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who had confronted Simon with intense anger. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a past case and of accepting shares for his fiancée. Simon denied the accusations, but his response was unconvincing even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered the fear of punishment from his school days. He wished he had been prepared and could have responded differently. Venetia's anger puzzled him, as he wondered why she felt the need to challenge his actions. He questioned whether her own conduct was flawless and feared that if the accusations spread, even as rumors, his career would be ruined."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live, thinking I would find anonymity among people who didn't mind if the rented houses' plaster, glass, and paintwork fell apart, or if the gardens were overgrown and the sofas were rotting. But, as with most things, I was wrong. People in the shops, who are living their real lives, even if you aren't, soon start to recognize you. The roses next door, spilling over the fence, remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to forget that it's summer outside, but tonight, I'm watching the swifts fly in the clear space between the treetops and roofs. I've cleared some rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms and hands are tingling with stings and scratches. It's a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive. 

""Been doing a bit of clearing, I see,"" says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of the window. She's the author of several unpublished manuscripts, which I sometimes have to pretend to like as an English teacher. I have a copy of her latest one now. ""How's the work going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""For goodness' sake. In no other profession does one have to explain oneself a thousand times a day to everyone,"" she replies, her voice trailing off before picking up again. ""Tell you what, Ann, I've got something to drink in the fridge. I'll bring it down."" I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I now see that it looks messy and empty. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. ""So, you're on holiday now, you lucky thing,"" she says, sprawling in shorts and a vest on the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a little lawn. ""Cheers,"" she says, pretending to be young. ""I should've gone into teaching—a writer doesn't have holidays. Still, you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can't, teach."" And there are those who can neither write nor teach. ""So, what plans for the holidays?"" All my postponed dread of the school year's end overwhelms me. Empty days. Hot pavements with melting chewing gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. ""Actually, I'm going down to Stonebridge tomorrow. I've been meaning to ask you if you'd feed the cats."" My heart races as I speak. ""Of course I will,"" Jaz says. ""If I'm around,"" knowing, as I did, that she would be. ""So where will you stay? Some fancy B and B?"" ""No. I'll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight."" It's not true that I will stay there, but then I spend my life dealing with fiction of one sort or another. ""Going back to your roots. So what do you think of it so far? My opus?"" My silence on the subject has forced Jaz to ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which lies half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing presents and mail-order goodies to other houses and delivering returned manuscripts in silly bags to hers. Something prompts me to speak honestly for once. ""Let me give you a little tip, dear,"" I begin. ""What?"" She is offended. ""Try writing about nice people for a change, pretty people who at least aspire to being good: a touch less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction..."" ""Teachers!"" Jaz is like a rebellious schoolgirl about to snatch back a poorly marked essay. ""I myself keep a journal, I have for years, in which I write down something good, however small or trivial, about each day."" My words sound as old-fashioned as my print dress. ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann."" Oh, I've got a life. I've got my work, and I go out sometimes and fly home again, sitting on the tube with my nose in a book. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives a moment's reassurance, then out of the blue comes the image of my school geography teacher Miss Tarrantine, who must have been about the age I am now, closing an ancient reptilian eyelid in a monstrous wink as she tells us, ""I've had my moments."" We nearly died."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage connects people and communities to the past. We often feel linked to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond this, there is a broader need to understand our past to help us interpret our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; understanding the past helps assure our future. Just as you inherit genes, you also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of your national heritage you dislike, but it is yours, and it is comforting to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link to the past was through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities and families, leading to the loss of much oral tradition. Now, places and architectural 'memories' provide clues to our past. It is crucial to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started a novel, ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became significant. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection, chose to write about this area. The short answer is that I chose the Fens for their apparent simplicity—a flat and empty stage for my book's drama. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as richly English as any other part of England but also strangely compelling and haunting. It is remarkable that in the middle of England, there is a region that many English people find foreign, especially when other distinctive areas of Britain have been absorbed into the nation's cultural and literary heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, seemingly open and obvious yet deeply mysterious. My research for the novel was not extensive; I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I am interested in imagined worlds and prefer inspired guesses over documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its logic, as Edward Storey's scholarly book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant displaying items with lengthy labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility requires more. Displays can be lively and interesting, using theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors' attention and evoke emotions. Museums should do more than just display items; they should make collections accessible to the widest community. Loan boxes for teachers are one example, and some museums now offer similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on 'artefacts and specimens'—not replicas. They provide encounters with authenticity, presenting items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength, distinguishing them from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CD-ROMs. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that their competitors in 'virtual history' are actually allies, stimulating interest in the 'real thing' that only museums can satisfy.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but now changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that most of us are affected. This turns some people into strong preservationists and encourages others to think more about the nature of towns today and their future. It can be argued that generations who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve than those before them—anything expressing stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not an enemy if we learn to manage it. Physical change in our towns reflects social change—changes in our population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will likely mention Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products related to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about his work, except that he developed theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and making strange predictions that seem to contradict everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thought, marking the start of modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to create a new, more logical description of the universe by studying the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by re-examining the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier explanations relied on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved within a fixed framework of space and time. Einstein challenged this idea, proposing that time and space are not absolute but relative.

**Young Readers**

During our childhood, Lydia and I were skeptical of any book that won a prize because we assumed it would be 'worthy', which we equated with 'boring'. While our mother disapproved of our lack of appreciation in a disdainful manner, our father would happily offer us small amounts of money, chapter by chapter, to encourage us to read an occasional educational book. He would also sneak in a few high-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a bold label, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we dismissed most of his selections as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, on one occasion, a well-known collection of poetry.

**Language**

""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous,"" wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. This mysterious origin has inspired many strange theories. In 1928, Charles Caller suggested that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when sensing danger. ""Meuh"" has a sad tone. Humans wandering through dangerous lands filled with fearsome creatures made desperate sounds, and languages have kept some echo of these cries, like the word malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Due to such odd speculations, many avoided the topic, seeing it as a field for eccentrics. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly interaction and played a key role in power dynamics. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's view of language as a 'great conduit' for conveying knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a reviewer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that ensure they have a very short lifespan. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they remain relevant only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. It's commonly believed, not just by the public but sometimes by the reviewers themselves, that reviewing is a task done out of necessity—often due to financial need or because one cannot work on a novel or a 'serious' book all day. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. Writing a concise and fair review in six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed six to eight thousand-word piece for an international journal. A fifteen hundred-word article in a weekly magazine presents challenges of both short and long formats. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, ranging from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer must know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This often means the reviewer also writes other types of work. The American novelist John Updike, who views criticism as 'hugging the shore,' still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think lesser-known writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, it's understandable if they seek some permanence and recognition, especially if they believe their best work is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. Fortunately, in the English-speaking world, there isn't a strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days when academics criticized professors for writing reviews are mostly over, as are complaints from non-professors about professors taking their opportunities. This is partly because there are more reviews now, so there's enough work for everyone, and partly because the rewards are often modest. I believe this situation benefits both readers, who can trust the reviewer knows the subject, and professors, as it helps them stay grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they might use complex language among themselves, they need to be clear when addressing intelligent non-professors. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary occupation. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, still hallway, felt a brief moment of doubt about owning it. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came over him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, curious about what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated with its inability to change. Occasionally, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or a blinking light on the answering machine, signs of life in his absence. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the contents disturbed, though he wondered what it would look like if they were. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the artificial world of the office and felt himself returning on the bus ride home, he no longer needed to be alone, a fact he often overlooked in his social plans. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but the relief of leaving work left him empty, waiting for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that working in a job that didn't suit him had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would often read or listen to music as the night grew darker, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed to get lost in his mind. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel this powerless, when he might have escaped if he had recognized his own worth. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to plan for a better future, but he wasn't surprised to find that he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining a role that would make him happy. He attended his only job interview with gratitude and didn't think to evaluate the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't consider the future interactions he would face. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through crowds, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was heading to the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was marked off for the race. It wasn't like professional racecourses, but the idea was the same: spectators stood on either side of the track. Organizers were trying to keep a few goats in line, which is not easy since goats are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I worried about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence?

You're not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you're saying. Show your conviction with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start your presentation by finding common ground with your audience and build towards your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot tightens. The mind also works at different speeds. Some mental tasks are quick, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be sped up, like solving puzzles or doing mental math. However, others cannot be rushed without breaking down, like the mayonnaise, or getting tangled, like the fishing line. Demanding quick results can be as counterproductive as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, each operating at different speeds and suited to different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought, requiring immediate, instinctive reactions. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted instantly to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. Concert pianists and Olympic fencers also rely on this fast, instinctive intelligence, which we might call ""wits."" The second speed involves deliberate thinking, where we figure things out, weigh pros and cons, and solve problems. A mechanic diagnosing an engine issue, a scientist interpreting results, or a student tackling an assignment all use this logical, conscious thinking, often called ""intellect."" People good at this are considered ""bright"" or ""clever."" The third speed is slower and less focused, more playful or dreamy. In this mode, we ruminate or mull things over, being contemplative or meditative. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or hovering between sleep and wakefulness, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. On the contrary, slow thinking is essential. We need the ""tortoise mind"" as much as the ""hare brain."" Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is suited to understanding complex, unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems, like choosing a holiday destination. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when issues are too subtle for conscious thought, we need the tortoise mind. For complex decisions, like managing a difficult team or changing careers, pondering may be more effective than searching for quick solutions. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and embraced slower, deeper ways of knowing. Philosophers have explored the mind's realms beyond conscious intellect. Recently, scientists have begun studying these slower ways of knowing. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can accomplish complex tasks if given time. It can learn subtle patterns, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than conscious thought."
CPE_29,"Surviving in a Foreign Land I have been warmly welcomed. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, anxious in a way I haven't felt since my first weeks at school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage my ability to talk has always given me. Elliot When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face, though, and when I saw him again, he would shake hands with me politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he tended to ignore me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he sent me a note inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often. Alfred Hitchcock The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed people are affected by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear, logical, and hard to argue with. He was a man of reason and a genius craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation, abstract ideas, or intellectual hints, and his view of his own film characters wasn't deep. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have transformed how we make charts and analyze observations. This might seem like the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. You might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with aircraft trails that can last for hours, forming clouds that make it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Society today has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the modern economy, people are always looking for the next new product or service. Technology speeds up this change, creating more noise and more choices. As soon as a new product is available, another one is ready to launch. This can be overwhelming and stressful, leading to a feeling of disconnect from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. People are now looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more brands of detergent and cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interfere with this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, perhaps a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants that is common today, and I don't like overly friendly waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them around the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and privacy is rare in commercial places these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

The transfer of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the main role and underestimated his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's remarkable performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are incredible. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the heart of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the vast white plateau in the interior, life does not exist. Except, that is, in a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers worldwide have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I would have thought that the key issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our connection with food is basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking might already agree with this, as they often buy cookbooks like this one. We sometimes think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply adding some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs to water. This is more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of purchasing a chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can make a delightful dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will love. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is rich in symbolism and meets our deep human needs, which is why our celebrations often happen around tables, whether for birthdays, anniversaries, or engagements. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing. Owning an apartment building added even more paperwork. Books and journals were piled near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be punctual for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was as precise about time as she was about neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think he had been robbed. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her look said she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**

Karen's simple wish not to be like her mother led her to create her own story, one of difference and strength. In her personal tale, there were key moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later explained. The club missed her eye, leaving only a few stitches that healed as a reminder of past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty, walking quickly across the wet grass of the village green, felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and her quiet life had little excitement. But she was deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her annual bouts of laryngitis, which were her only health issues. His most valuable trait, she thought, was making patients feel he had plenty of time and genuinely wanted to hear their concerns. This quality made him beloved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, earning loyalty and affection in return."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are captivating, showcasing her incredible skill and energy. At a recent concert for children, after playing various styles like classical, jazz, and blues, a young boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" For Joanna, this was amusing, and she easily fulfilled the request, proving herself to the young audience.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how children learn the piano. She has published an elementary piano tutor for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even with her demanding work schedule. She is involved in many projects, including running her own recording label, Sound Circus, and collaborating with other artists.

Why take on writing a book? Joanna believes the first lessons in music are crucial. She feels that the music profession often focuses too much on creating virtuosos, while most people have a more everyday interest in music. Her books draw from her experience teaching beginners and growing up in a home where her mother taught piano to children of all backgrounds.

Joanna believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children progress quickly, but she is interested in those who enjoy playing for a while but often give up. This can happen at any stage, sometimes due to frustration or parental pressure to excel.

She is cautious about criticizing other piano tutors or teaching methods. Her books are colorful and engaging, with storylines and CDs to make learning fun. She encourages improvisation and exploration of the piano. As children progress, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. Joanna, who relied on her ear as a child, understands this challenge but emphasizes the importance of practice.

Joanna admits she didn't practice rigorously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a contemporary repertoire that required it. Now, she values practice as the core of her musical life, even more than performances. She advises setting clear goals for practice, rewarding oneself, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This suggests that good writing is challenging. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they have few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them multiple times. I believe this is because writing by hand was physically demanding. The slow pace of handwriting forced me to think carefully. What was hard to change or erase was written with care. In contrast, the ease of using a computer can lead to carelessness. Many writers find that the time spent revising drafts on a computer is similar to the time spent writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. This electronic communication is said to have revived the art of the love letter, with millions now being sent. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel monotonous. Writers often don't realize the power of the written word and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and character of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was unimpressive, but the shiny disc inside was intriguing. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he returned to the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, bending over the hi-fi system. He turned it on, and lights appeared. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the tray slid back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, straightening up. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd be amazed at the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They ignore that changes in how we think take generations, and such claims fall into the trap of believing one's own time is the most important in history. Consider this prediction from the book ""Mighty Micro"" in 1979: ""The 1980s will see the book as we know it, and as our ancestors created and cherished it, begin a slow and steady slide to oblivion."" So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is so unpleasant that most people avoid it, and the way information is organized on computers encourages brief reading. Tech enthusiasts argue that this tendency leads to new forms of storytelling and creativity. But there's nothing new about ""non-linearity."" Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage the deep thinking needed to read something completely.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and found a perfectly organized space. The carpet was free of the paper mess that had covered it since it was installed, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talents. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, more as a statement than a question. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months, so she should have known. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. However, he was there all the time now, realizing that staying away would lead to chaos. He often thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis. He wanted a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the firm. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned for books. Ian's unpredictable nature made him even less reliable. Lancelot skimmed the synopsis, recognizing almost every phrase. He closed the folder, knowing Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt uninspired. Lancelot recalled stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete, coaxed from him chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were small parts of an advance never given. Ian's advance was huge, reversing the usual business practice of paying authors after they deliver a manuscript. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers had quickly taken over British theatre, but Ian's energy seemed unmatched. He wore his coat like a cape and spoke of famous writers as if he knew them personally. Yet, Ian's creative potential remained untapped. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At his peak as a literary influencer, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he failed to produce even one issue despite a large budget. His contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high salary, which increased in hopes of making him produce more, but he produced little. At editorial meetings, Ian was sharp-tongued and critical. Ten years later, he was unreliable even for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that commissioning ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'England's breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts, but historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast is rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and to the sick having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast gradually became common. Some writers say this was due to more available food. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important, as people started working set hours, often very early. Therefore, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their technical skills, artistic sense, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. This book will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might have an implicit understanding of the photos they see. However, instead of accepting the photo as it is, we might question if it accurately captured the scene as it appeared at the time. Alternatively, does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-belief. You need to focus entirely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you must prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows and encourages individual excellence, yet it is a team game, and you must balance these two aspects. It's much like life—you can succeed individually, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot—not just financially. It has opened doors and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things worldwide that others may never see. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so vivid that they become clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California years ago. I lay awake, listening to a mockingbird's beautiful song from an unseen spot in the tall trees around the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's exquisite singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic environment. To follow the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird convinced me I was hearing an amazing improvisational performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 'Throughout history, humans have had a complex relationship with birds, filled with admiration, fear, and reverence. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. A soft thudding sound comes from the greenhouse as a small brown bird, a wren, repeatedly hits the glass. This bird, often seen as a symbol of omens and predictions, might be delivering a message from the edges of our imagination. Or perhaps it's simply trapped. Both interpretations could be valid. Wrens have been part of British culture for centuries. In medieval times, the direction a wren flew was believed to predict the observer's luck. Today, images of wrens are common in British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. A forest without wrens feels empty and lacking. This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, dating back to when humans relied on nature for survival and developed a cultural language to express the importance of other creatures. This significance can change over time. For instance, in the early 1500s, red kites were common in London and valued as scavengers. However, they were later seen as pests and nearly disappeared, except in Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of British conservation and were reintroduced to restore their population. Our bond with birds goes beyond culture and is linked to human evolution. Early humans observed birds for signs of predators, weather, and food, and saw them as a link to the supernatural. Birds' flight, song, and freedom fascinate us, reflecting our identity and connection to nature. Some may see these feelings as outdated, but they remain part of us, like the appendix or wisdom teeth. Birds now serve as indicators of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, a loss that affects both nature and culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize love and magic, and their decline is felt deeply by those familiar with literature and folklore. Yet, the loss of birds not featured in stories often goes unnoticed. Folklore is crucial, as it connects us to birds through stories and legends, offering a deeper bond than scientific terms. These tales evoke emotions and attitudes buried beneath modern life. Whether watching wildlife films or observing birds in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds captivate us in ways we struggle to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding its song as it flies into the future, leaving us with a mystery to ponder.'"
CPE_28,"Text: 'Maps The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface using distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in terms of time, like 'a day's journey by river', which told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, written itineraries were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show landmarks, with their size indicating importance. The conventions used in maps varied depending on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is crucial when studying old maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding what maps show. Cartography has used other sciences to help, like using the magnetic compass instead of relying on shadows or stars for direction. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, maps became more detailed. Discoveries like the earth being slightly flattened at the poles led to more precise mapping. Over time, the users of maps expanded beyond travelers and merchants to include soldiers, archaeologists, historians, and geographers, each with specific needs. Modern cartographers have developed ways to map various distributions, such as geological layers and climate patterns. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography. However, the development of cartography has not been continuous or straightforward. There have been times of slow progress and rapid development, with old ideas coexisting with new ones. Cartographers often understood the theory behind progress but had to wait for better tools to apply their ideas. Since copying old maps was easier and cheaper, map publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be accepted without question as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so fascinating and instructive.'"
CPE_35,"Text: 'TIM RICE I was invited into the young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space amidst a rather chaotic set of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour felt like upgrading from economy to business class. Here was the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and the surprising evidence of a teenager who had invested in Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months to spare before starting, during which he planned to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild as his; I wanted to be a pop star, for all the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not a matter of life or death, though it's easy to say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me, to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no hesitation in trying. This was partly because within ten minutes of meeting, he was at the piano playing three tunes he had composed—I could tell he was talented. Very talented. As he confidently played selections from some of the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I had little to impress him with in return, other than instant praise for his music and a genuine, actually released, seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) with which an unknown pop group had ended their failing career by recording three months earlier. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact on musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we failed to compete with the top musical composers, we could try to challenge the Beatles and Rolling Stones later, in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would clearly need some new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a solicitor, the brief certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded somewhat. I would, of course, continue to keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist, and would write a few more simple songs that wouldn't reveal the limitations of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him, to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. And Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room. The idea was the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't truly inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, owing too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his score's brilliance was infectious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I set to work with great enthusiasm, especially for the songs that were meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and in many cases gave me the title as well, most of which had presumably been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be ill, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers.'"
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have an extraordinary ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy through language. Language is so integral to human life that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you find two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This suggests that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning wasn't invented by a clever spider and doesn't rely on education or a talent for building.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, mainly created by the air around us, have a strong impact on the lives and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can greatly influence the appearance of landscapes. For instance, constant warmth and rain support the growth of tropical jungles, which are rich in species diversity. In contrast, cold, windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that form the climate over time are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the air, being light, doesn't move as fast as the spinning Earth. However, the sun is a more significant cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but more challenging was making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I underwent several days of intense coffee-making training, learning more than I ever wanted to about maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was harder than it seemed, and I expected to be demoted to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to master it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture seem perfect for TV, as the camera can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions,"" which explores American art. Hughes is a reliable critic with a captivating personality, and he had nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often overlooked by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but it instead examined how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, one can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which aligns well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed the market would regulate the price of scarce metals have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are decreasing. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate allegations against a multinational conglomerate benefiting from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis available, or you can rent a boat to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called ""The Sailing Capital of the World"" for a reason. Its calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. On land, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle at night."
CPE_69,"Text: 'Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop The Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a course where you can create a custom bike frame and enjoy a weekend of bike-building. It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The only sign of life among the small factories is the sound of machinery from an upper window at the Bamboo Bike Club, the UK's only bamboo bike-building course. I've come to see the action. There's a buzz of energy and fun. Bamboo is becoming popular in bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have revived a method first used in 1894. The main issue for cyclists is the cost. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies costs $2,995, or £1,868. This, along with the design challenge, inspired James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to create a boutique bamboo bike business with affordable products. After refining their product, they realized they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. The Bamboo Bike Club became more of a community than a company. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run monthly courses where you can build a custom bike frame for a competitive price. As someone who often fails at DIY projects, I was concerned about quality. On the first day, James and Ian teach how to select bamboo for strength and form strong joints. Tubes are lightly glued in place: first the front triangle, then the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are used for parts needing more strength. Using jigs, power tools, and design blueprints is a challenge for someone used to assembling flatpack furniture. Accurate cutting is tricky. James and Ian supervise every step and help if needed. The self-build is a big draw for many participants, most of whom are engineers. Ian reassures that mistakes are normal and easy to fix with another piece of bamboo. Each piece is pre-checked for quality, allowing you to focus on aesthetics: plain, black, or mottled bamboo. Sunday is more relaxed, spent building the lugs with hemp bindings glued with epoxy resin for strong joints. A final polymer coating makes the bike waterproof. The bike is then ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other touches. It's built for durability, as strong as metal bikes. Ian has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without damage. 'Our bikes are over-engineered, but I prefer it that way,' James says. Bamboo bikes may look a bit scruffy compared to professional frames, but they have unique charm. I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides, not racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a gentle ride. They ride well too. I try James's bike, and it's light, stiff, and smooth, thanks to bamboo's vibration-dampening ability. 'Some love the build, but for me, the workshops shine when the bike is on the road,' James says. 'They're light, effortless, and fun to ride.' And the price? Less than £500.'"
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first came across a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,"" she recalls, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray, known for his understanding approach, is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on improving communication between men and women is a key symbol of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to address many of America's desires for self-improvement. It also benefits from these desires, creates many more, and supports the New York publishing world. As Britain is discovering, this genre can fill shelves with books as exaggerated as their covers, but there are worse. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too niche. This is a small relief. As a new type of editor-agent searches for the next big hit, writing style is the last concern. Marketability is everything. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the key questions and admits, ""If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**

There must be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. Such an agreement is rarely fully kept. There are many reasons why a writer might not be completely honest. There might be actions or thoughts that are too embarrassing to share. Some things might be left out because the writer thinks they are not important. There are also more complex reasons for not telling the whole truth. The writer might believe that inventing stories can reveal the truth about themselves more clearly than sticking to the facts. Or they might decide from the start not to stick to the truth at all. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, which helps in storytelling. Some readers might still believe it is true even after finishing the book, thinking they have read a true story when it is actually fiction. This can be done without any cynical intent.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Experts on detective stories have explained the popularity of this genre as a reflection of the conflicts in late 19th and early 20th-century society. The detective story is essentially a symbolic tale. The crime represents basic human desires like lust or greed, and solving it, at least in traditional stories, symbolizes the reintegration of the individual with society, calming its lawless impulses so society can function smoothly again. In Hammett's unique version, society is restored to its previous state, but that state is shown to be corrupt and false. The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's stories are two sides of the same personality. The private detective and his target understand each other and, in a strange way, are comfortable with each other. The private detective is part of both worlds. To the criminal, he seems too honest, and to the law, he seems too shady. He is both a crook and a competitor. The private detective's mission is sometimes softened by his sense of involvement, and sometimes his desire to punish is increased by his anxiety about this ambiguity.

**Science Writing**

Today's greatest scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss his craft and hear his advice, I met him in an unusual setting: the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt very comfortable there. About writing in such a grand setting, Gould said, ""I couldn't do it: Trollope might, but he knew the culture. And knowing the culture is essential to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is a civilization of its own. As a result, only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't live in the community and don't understand its rules, you are at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's principles is: never underestimate the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but must never dilute it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers realize they are being talked down to, your piece is finished."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, the air feels cold. To combat this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quieter times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It symbolizes our ability to control or change the climate. However, many buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple measures could greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It's not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials, which measure time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became garden ornaments—romantic but outdated in a modern age. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm is in their connection to the planets. He describes a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show where serious, grey-haired women painted teacups with delicate flowers using precise brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke was perfect. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed they had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered who would take a china-painting course. Would beginners show natural artistry? In reality, the atmosphere was not intimidating. The students were there to have fun, and even the tutor didn't want to paint petals on teacups with the speed I remembered."
CPE_47,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent mentioned that the other travelers were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Due to a mistake at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or a computer, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland at the Edelweiss Hotel, Room 212. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform, who confirmed their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

Upon landing, a woman with glasses told them to stay together, and they assumed there was an overnight stop. When they arrived at the hotel near midnight, they were too tired to question anything. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the entire holiday. The receptionist mentioned the lake and water birds and suggested a steamer trip to Interlaken. Keith calmly explained that they were supposed to be in Venice, but the receptionist insisted they were booked for twelve nights in Switzerland. Dawne described the travel agent who made the booking, hoping to resolve the issue.

Mrs. Franks, the woman from the plane, introduced herself and explained that Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many trips, and all tickets and labels look similar. She laughed, saying they could have ended up anywhere if they just followed others with the same label. Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing, and the receptionist was gone. Dawne whispered that Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, recalling every detail of their journey.

An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, approached them, saying they had a great night's sleep due to the lakeside air. Keith and Dawne left the reception area, not mentioning the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a tour with elderly people, which was the opposite of what they wanted. Uncle had insisted they needed a break from the demands of the elderly."
CPE_48,"Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are now looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. In Britain, most people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. In America, however, he has only recently gained recognition. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are enthusiastically catching up. Biographies and accounts of the Endurance voyage are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his achievements with admiration, drawing lessons in leadership and communication. They refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton.' The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises.' Examples include 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go.' While Shackleton once worked in public relations for a Glasgow steelworks, it might be hard to see the connection between surviving on albatross in freezing temperatures and managing a financial crisis. 'Even if a company handles its crises well, it can still cause harm by communicating poorly,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. He had his values in order and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most fascinating decisions was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That decision established his credibility for the next expedition: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole when, 97 miles short of their goal, with delays depleting their supplies and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. While managers today often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it on. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety if you continue to do your utmost and trust me.' From the accounts and diaries kept by his men, it is clear that Shackleton was always in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every possibility, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go of losses and start anew. We've developed effective principles here that Shackleton exemplifies. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is nothing, especially in America, where the culture is against letting time resolve issues,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on interest rates, you hold on, and eventually, you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a huge loss. Similarly, don't be afraid to change plans if they're not working. If a new product fails, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted Hurley take his own gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if Hurley didn't wear them. Someone else recalled him doing the same with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public's appetite for heroic endeavors is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism today. Everything else fades away, and he remains the true embodiment of the ideals we long for now.'"
CAE_15,"In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that has a lifestyle similar to a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by boring into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue, while the aye-aye uses its sharp incisor teeth and a long, thin third finger. Although the aye-aye's feeding method was described over a century ago, scientists have only recently discovered how it finds insects inside the wood.

Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and her daughter Annabelle. He tested if they found insects by looking for visual signs, like holes on the wood surface. He gave them logs with drilled holes, some leading to mealworms and others to empty spaces. The aye-ayes went directly to the mealworm cavities, showing they didn't rely on visual clues.

Dr. Erickson also tested if they used smell or sound to find the insects. The aye-ayes could locate mealworms even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent. This suggested they weren't using sight, smell, or hearing to find the insects.

Dr. Erickson discovered that aye-ayes could sense cavities in the wood. They tap the wood with their middle finger and focus their large ears forward. He suggests they use echo-location, listening for reverberations that indicate a hollow space. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that aye-ayes take the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting, but there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood. The aye-aye can be seen as a combination of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat. It also behaves like a squirrel, with continuously growing incisors, and has been observed gnawing through nut shells to extract the meat with its long finger."
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us incomplete glimpses, and family stories are often half remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they will still be two-dimensional. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. These are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for posterity, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of confidentiality helps people be honest. ""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know now. If they insist, I'll let them, but I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things parents say and do affect their children for life. People often marry those their parents would approve of, or rebel and do the opposite."" ""Many disappointments come out. Even sixty years later, people regret or resent unresolved issues with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had issues in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some seek permission to say 'I can't stand my mother.'"" Ms. Renier is a recorder, not an inquisitor, and keeps her distance. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it anyway—they can remove it when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest, warts and all."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not people saying, 'I've had such an interesting life the world needs to know about it.' Things are moving faster than ever, and we're losing sight of the past. It's a way of giving roots. We need a link to our ancestors because families don't sit together as they used to. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: you can choose your own color and title. Fascinating to the private audience each book is aimed at, the results are not sensationalist. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well; the final content is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often from the upper class, readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world with a collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, featuring over six hundred pieces. It's important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all precise replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with excellent natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. Almost all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in one afternoon.

This collection contains over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are of great interest as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human impact from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can assist with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can be purchased, usually taking about a month to produce.

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, and it is a unique tourist attraction in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the surviving brasses are in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**

Due to my unusual personal life, which I can't really be proud of, I've had 35 years of being around young children, and I've loved every moment. This morning, I had the joy of feeding the baby, and to me, that's what being a father is all about. I'm very fortunate with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I've become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I've slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been a very attentive father, but I've always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always letting them call me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you create a heavy burden of guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite annoying. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I have always valued. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I might have lost touch with: music, youth culture, clothes. In a way, this has been invaluable for running the agency. I've never felt out of touch. Because I was trying to establish the business when they were young, I missed some things: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are benefits now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with many of our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies with us without feeling intimidated. I think it's an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others followed quickly. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a real issue. I insist on only accepting weekend meetings and public appearances where there are facilities for one or more of the kids to come with me. If I didn't, they would just be left out. This way, they understand what I do when I'm not with them, and there's no feeling of Daddy disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we're all becoming more aware of the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I had to look closely at fatherhood more than I might have otherwise. I made great efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wished, but I think Kate and Bonnie would say now that they found that quite confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I'm not sure I was a very good father. It's true I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining just the other day that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more structure, more order. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I had turned 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending our money on new sofas every Saturday when we could have a child instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me come to terms with who I am. You feel you're doing something very special when you have a child, and you are. But you're also becoming just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. I do resent it occasionally, but if there's ever a moment of irritation, it's dispelled by just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest self-preservation mechanism in the world. It can melt a grown man."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their theories in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707. However, appearances were misleading, and the 13 students from Europe and America were about to experience an extraordinary flight. Inside, the aircraft was transformed into a long white tunnel with few windows, illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat. For a year, they had competed with other students to join this flight, a challenge by the European Space Agency to propose creative experiments in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, described as an extraordinary roller-coaster ride.

For the next two hours, the Boeing's flight would mimic a giant bird's erratic path, soaring upwards and then plunging downwards. The goal was to achieve weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the aircraft continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In those brief moments between ascending and descending, everything inside became weightless, and the students felt closer to the moon than Earth.

The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep 45-degree climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin. Then the engines cut out, and weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step sent us towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; directions lost their meaning. Only gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand movement.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. Gravity's return was less immediate but sudden enough to cause some students to land with a bump. With the first curve completed, some turned green at the thought of 29 more. Thirty curves provided ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to understand how cats always land on their feet. They released the device, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. However, another student accidentally landed on it during a less graceful return to gravity.

Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by the absence of gravity, considering future space station construction. Another team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity, believing that perfected solar sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht's sails use the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was exhilaration, not nausea. This sensation would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**Jonathon Porritt Talks to Danny Danziger**

Jonathon Porritt, author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*, shares a unique period in his life when he experienced nine consecutive winters. He traveled to New Zealand every summer, which is winter there, and enjoyed the cold season. His parents proposed buying a small plot of land for him and his siblings to manage. His mother said, ""If you can take the time and trouble to plant it with trees, then you can have it."" This idea was to ensure they always had a connection to New Zealand, where their father grew up.

They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in Rangitoupuni. Although the land was not very fertile, it was suitable for planting trees. Jonathon, who had worked on sheep stations in Australia, was enthusiastic about the project. He began planting in 1968, and by 1972, he and his siblings had planted the entire 70 acres.

The winter of 1968 in New Zealand was particularly rainy, making the planting process challenging. Despite the cold and wet conditions, Jonathon recalls it as a happy time. Each morning, he faced the task of preparing for another day of planting, dealing with wet clothes and slippery boots. He worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since he was new to serious tree planting.

Planting involved carrying a bag filled with trees and aligning them in straight lines using poles. Jonathon enjoyed the physical work, which kept him fit. Over time, he developed a rhythm, making the process almost automatic. This repetitive work allowed his mind to wander, leading to reflections on life and the natural world—thoughts that later influenced his career.

Jonathon has returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which he finds satisfying. He worries about natural disasters affecting the trees but is pleased they are now 20 years old and thriving. In 1984, he took a break from teaching to spend three months alone on the tree farm, where he wrote his first book, *Seeing Green*. The simple cabin on the farm became his writing retreat, and he spent his days writing, pruning trees, and researching. The connection he feels to this land is profound, representing a strong bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" I thought as a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I had turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, gaining a reputation for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. Inside, I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their velvet-like coats, later found to have fleas, and milky eyes looked up from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March, spending their early life underground. If orphaned, they often die of starvation and are never found. These three were brought in by builders who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I placed them by the stove in the farmhouse kitchen for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially, I fed them with a syringe, wiping them with a warm cloth to mimic their mother's licking, which helped them relieve themselves. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum,"" they seemed content.

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, though still eating normally. It was a warning sign I missed. The next morning, I found him dead. A vet's post-mortem revealed a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's crucial not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. Disheartened, I continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. The area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. Willow II joined us. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother left him. He was difficult to feed. I had to move and squeeze the bottle's teat in his mouth to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By the end of April, the females were weaned onto creamed rice and then anything. Willow was different. He gave up the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods.

At nearly five months old, they were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was hot, making it hard to dig for earthworms. By August, my foundlings became nocturnal, walking only at dusk or night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined less often, didn't. His reactions to being caught were as colorful as his bruises. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They likely extended their territories for food, as badgers are territorial and can kill intruders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we secured the gate with sheet metal. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, sparking interest. We started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for them. With advice, we designed their new home. Our son Daniel drew up plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their nightly walks. It had three chambers, one larger, with a glass side for viewing from a darkened enclosure. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they preferred the sett, enjoying the tunnels and bedding. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they moved in. After watching them, we left them to settle. Later, I checked and found them asleep in their chambers. Now, my walks with them are less frequent, as they wake at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally; she joined a neighboring sett. Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, a home they've accepted."
CAE_67,"Text: 'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, aims to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his major achievements, according to his peers, was mapping the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', refer to the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without understanding declination, sailors couldn't accurately correct their compasses, making it difficult to determine longitude and navigate the seas. Halley, one of only two men in England at the time paid to conduct scientific research, embarked on a mission to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip to the Cape Verde Islands was cut short due to crew issues, but he set sail again. This second voyage took him to Rio de Janeiro, past South Georgia, up to Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart and its more advanced successors were crucial for sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made them outdated. Dr Clark, an enthusiastic sailor, plans to honor Halley's achievements by retracing the Paramore's route for its three-hundredth anniversary. He needs to raise £70,000 for the journey, with support from Sir Vivian Fuchs, leader of the first cross-Antarctica expedition. Dr Clark became interested in Halley during a two-year stay at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' Dr Clark says. 'He was a respected scientist and explorer. He wasn't just an astronomer; he also researched geophysics. As Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and pursued other interests.' During this time, Halley developed a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Dr Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The expedition, named 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more precise instruments. These measurements are needed because Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. 'It's common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure direction,' says Dr Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites for that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. Coincidentally, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements globally. Dr Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and notes that ground-based measurements are useful for comparison. It's easy to forget how significant Halley's Atlantic journey was. It was the first dedicated scientific sea expedition, and Halley was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue what many saw as an obsession with declination. Does Dr Clark have the qualifications to make his voyage successful? Besides his two years in Antarctica and work with the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? 'I'm willing to dedicate eight months of my life to this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**Power Dressing**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire display their stunning tail feathers to the critical eyes of the peahens. This behavior puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, how did such extravagant features evolve? Darwin believed in evolution through natural selection, where the ""fittest"" survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to contradict this idea, as it is cumbersome and not practical for survival. To explain this, Darwin proposed ""sexual selection,"" suggesting that females choose mates based on beauty alone.

Darwin's colleague, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens preferred showy tails, there must be a hidden advantage, perhaps related to survival. This debate remains unresolved, as studying peafowl behavior is challenging. However, the semi-wild peacocks at Whipsnade offer a unique opportunity for research.

Marion Petrie and her team at the Open University are investigating two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? And do these males possess other advantageous qualities? Observations suggest that peahens do favor males with more eye-spots on their tails, which attract more mates. However, whether these males are superior in other ways is still unclear.

William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be healthier, with fewer parasites, and their plumage signals this. While there is evidence for this in other birds, Petrie's team has not yet tested this in Whipsnade peacocks. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former grow faster or are healthier, which would support Wallace's theory.

A final twist comes from R.A. Fisher's idea of ""Fisher's Runaway."" He suggested that if females prefer slightly better tails, their offspring will inherit these traits, leading to a cycle where longer tails become more common. This feedback loop could explain the peacock's tail, supporting Darwin's idea of ""beauty for beauty's sake."""
CAE_66,"Text: 'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The ideal boat design should blend old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He applied this in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases yachts filled with new technology. Most are based on a hull-shape revolution from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly on a tidal creek off the south coast. Designed last year, she looks as if she could be 100 years old, suggesting her owner might be a romantic. Maybe I am, but I doubt it. This boat benefits from traditional design magic, yet modern technology made the job easier. However, while modern technology is crucial in design and building, it often shields crews from the true maritime experience they seek. I'm not saying sailors should face every hardship. My boats always have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping berths. But why sail if every sail sets and furls itself? A bit of struggle with the sails is part of a sailor's life. And why move steering from the safe aft to a risky spot near the bow? Sadly, this creates a cabin like an ocean liner, with a bed bigger than at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a floating cottage. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the former owner said she had every comfort but no luxury. During my time with her, I learned how wise he was. Her sails were heavy, and she lacked pumped water, electricity, a fridge, central heating, winches, and electronics, especially for navigation, yet she was the kindest, easiest boat I've sailed. On land, though, classic boats need a lot of care due to their age. After a back injury, I realized my 15-year love affair with her had to end. Finding a younger replacement was tough, so I decided to build a new boat. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a napkin, then moved to the computer. After creating a set of lines, he carved a model, like in the old days. We reviewed the model, then adjusted the design electronically. The final version was perfect. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four of her first six races. Her look is timeless, her movement at sea is delightful, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This might be because she was designed purely as a sailing craft, without considering furniture. This is the traditional way of the sea. In her timeless calm, she proves it works; that you don't need to follow trends to find satisfaction, and that history's lessons are valuable. Built with timber treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. She has all the benefits of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a classic one.'"

I was thrilled to spend six days at Henlow Grange as I needed a break. My room in the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable, and I felt relaxed immediately. On the first day, I rested and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined various classes like body conditioning, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The hour-long facial was rejuvenating. The staff were friendly and professional, creating an atmosphere of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to add a half-size Olympic pool and a Light Diet Room this year. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or enjoy a peaceful walk. My mood and appetite improved during my stay, and I left feeling energized. I look forward to returning. This is an ideal getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a charming conservatory, and plenty of space for solitude. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were called patients, which felt odd since I am healthy. However, a shoulder issue was identified and addressed in group workshops and individual sessions. Each person follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting but had a headache on the second day from hunger. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and exotic fruit with yoghurt and broth for supper. If not on a diet, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious. Massages or water therapy are provided on alternate days, and extra treatments are reasonably priced. - Liz Gregory

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans and chimpanzees diverged, we haven't developed many genetic differences; we are still over 98% identical to chimps. On an evolutionary scale, what separates humans from animals is a recent development. Our ability to create art and other uniquely human traits must come from a small fraction of our genes. This suggests that the differences between us and animals are mostly matters of degree. For instance, both wild chimpanzees and sea otters use tools, and monkeys have simple languages with distinct warning sounds.

The few absolute differences between humans and animals include art. However, if art is a unique human trait, it's puzzling that our ancestors didn't create it for most of our evolutionary history. Early art forms like wood carvings or body painting might not have survived. Clear evidence of human art appears with the Cro-Magnons around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we claim that our recent creative burst sets us apart, we must consider how our art differs from animal creations. Three distinctions are often suggested: human art is non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and transmitted by learning rather than genes.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art doesn't help us survive or pass on genes, unlike most animal behaviors. While human art communicates thoughts or feelings, it doesn't transmit genes. In contrast, birdsong helps defend territory or attract mates, thus aiding gene transmission.

Second, human art is often motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask robins if they enjoy their songs, but they sing mainly during breeding season, suggesting they sing for reasons other than pleasure. By this measure, human art seems unique.

Third, human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human groups have distinctive art styles that are learned, not genetically wired. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily distinguishable, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, inherit the ability to sing their species' song without learning it.

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly styles change. Geese honk the same way they did 2,000 years ago, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum-goers can distinguish twentieth-century paintings from older works. Connoisseurs can often identify when and who painted a piece. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-twentieth-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day and was upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were exhibited in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and most were sold.

These ape paintings blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they served no narrow utilitarian function and were created for the painter's satisfaction. You might argue that human art is different because it often aims to communicate. However, some human art, later famous, was created for private satisfaction, similar to the apes' indifference to communicating with others."
CAE_39,"**An Epic Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth and also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the tale. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to feature courageous explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes narrowed from looking into far horizons on their journeys into the unknown. These days, such people are rare in fiction and even rarer in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure involved leading an expedition across the Taklamakan Desert in western China, one of the last unexplored places on earth. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but locals call it the Desert of Death. He recalled the dangers and excitement of that amazing trek in the calm atmosphere of his family home. The team he led included four Britons (one of them the party's medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance lorry drivers. This misunderstanding could have cost everyone their lives and certainly jeopardized the expedition's success.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least hospitable desert, and Charles Blackmore has written a captivating account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He launched the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I had always assumed I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered promotion but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a tremendous gamble. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the event, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'

Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word 'kind'. The team suffered extreme hardships: dysentery, temperature extremes, severe thirst and dehydration, and the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our own endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never hit the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally immobilized us. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against hurdles the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily laden camels, which often rolled over onto us.'

'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no contingency plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental stamina for the trip but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert and it was such an inferno that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment I was a very scared man.'

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers you're not going to duck out. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and sinewy despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How conscious was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that yardstick, the desert does not measure up, does not compare.'

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were buoyed up by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.'"

Are we as dependent on technology as we think? Gradually, I've been letting household technology fade away as it naturally wears out. This makes me question what 'time' technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? If so, marketing experts have fooled us. When my gadget started making strange noises, even when unplugged, I left it in the backyard, where it now sits like a ghost. I'm no longer tied to a noisy machine, and I can take my time with my sewing. I was always a bit scared of those electric machines that rush towards your fingers. Best of all, I can carry my sewing with me wherever I go. Of course, there are some gadgets I wouldn't want to live without. A year without a washing machine taught me the value of an electric one. But losing some gadgets has brought unexpected joy. Feeling that we were spending too much time in front of the TV, I returned the rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. It's hard on the eyes but makes us focus on what's worth watching. We now spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or enjoying other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I've given up my old Singer sewing machine, which is now a plant stand. I can't afford a new one, so I sew by hand. We've come to believe we can't live without technology, and while we might resist the idea that our lives would be unmanageable without it, we don't want to give it up. We pity past generations who had to endure hard, tedious work. Even our brains are relieved by computers that do fast calculations and provide entertainment. But the time I spend sewing is far from tedious, and there are many benefits. I can sew and listen to the radio, another rediscovered pleasure, or talk with family and friends. If it's a simple task, I can watch TV and feel less guilty about sitting in front of it by doing something useful. It's a lovely feeling to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea. I used to think with horror about women who sewed elaborate garments by hand, imagining the long hours and eye strain. But there's something soothing about handcrafting, and great satisfaction in seeing my work improve. Things get done surprisingly quickly, and life slows down to the rhythm of my hands. I'm also free from the rush of modern life, where we hurry from one task to the next. I've regained control of my sink, where I enjoy daydreaming while washing up, a pleasant, if forgotten, activity. Now, I look around my house and wonder: do we really need the freezer, the microwave, the electric lawnmower? We could save a lot of money by doing without electric lights!"
CAE_62,"Charles Hurst, a cabinet-maker, earns his living by creating beautifully crafted furniture. When I visit his workshop in East London, he greets me quickly, suggesting he is a busy man. His workshop, located under a railway arch, is filled with unfinished furniture and various planks of wood. Hurst has been in this trade for ten years and has gained a strong reputation. His schedule is always full, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want quality furniture like cupboards, tables, or bookcases, Hurst is the person to contact.

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, but finding one who focuses on clean, simple designs is rare. Hurst is critical of modern furniture and mass-produced items, believing many craftsmen produce subpar work. His pursuit of perfection and his talent contribute to his success. Hurst is confident in his abilities, claiming he has a natural talent for making things. He is self-taught, learning by asking the right questions.

Most of his work comes from private clients, some of whom return for more pieces. He finds satisfaction in furnishing entire homes but admits that client relationships can be challenging. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want. Despite his confidence, Hurst acknowledges that there are better craftsmen than him and admires their work. He criticizes those who take too long to create a single piece and dislikes degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. For Hurst, furniture should be practical and usable.

Though confident and sometimes brusque, Hurst is not pretentious. As I leave, he humbly remarks, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"Text: 'Three theories about sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. It seems clear that sleep has an important role. However, what that role is remains uncertain. Scientists do not fully agree on why we spend so much time sleeping. There are three main theories. The most popular theory suggests that sleep is mainly for physical health. It says we sleep to keep our bodies healthy. During sleep, biological processes repair damage from the day and restore our bodies to full efficiency. Another theory focuses on the learning benefits of sleep. It suggests that sleep helps us process information we learn during the day, and without sleep, learning would not happen. A third theory is about energy. It suggests that we need sleep to recharge our energy, so we have enough for the next day.'"
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our quirks, like a passion for entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing indignant letters to the press. Eccentricity is about expressing our individuality. Within us, there is a constant conflict between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and appreciated, more than we want to stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While we often follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We want to assert our individuality, like the man at the bar who says, ""I say what I think,"" or the stranger who says, ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to assert our individuality. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk."" However, this self-conscious assertion of individuality is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears bizarre clothes for publicity or a society hostess makes outrageous comments to get noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. They are not concerned with public opinion and are barely aware of it. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all very aware of the world around them. Eccentrics, on the other hand, go their own way regardless of society."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books: Influential Wildlife Classics**

We asked four leading naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**

Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've had the privilege of meeting some pioneers in the field. None have been more influential than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who stood at the heart of environmental issues in post-war Europe. Her work synthesized various environmental movements into a compelling philosophy. As a young journalist, her insights made everything clear to me. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" However, ""The Home of Man,"" despite its old-fashioned title even in 1976, is her most important work to me. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and advocates for what we now call 'sustainable human development.' Among the hundreds of books I've read since, none have matched its impact.

**B. Linda Bennett**

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can vividly recall the sounds and smells of a herring gull colony. This book brilliantly explains animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos to a well-organized social structure. You can identify partners, boundaries, and families. Niko Tinbergen, a distinguished behaviorist, aimed to explain his findings to the general public. His collaboration with wildlife artist Eric Ennion resulted in a book that appeals to anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's spontaneous painting style, developed from years of observing birds, captures the essence of their behavior with minimal lines and color. This is the art of a true field naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**

""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that has most influenced my life. Beyond leading me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation, it solidified my devotion to the natural world. While researching animal vocalizations in Madagascar, I faced many setbacks. But reading this book each night made the world seem brighter. It weaves animals, people, joy, and beauty into a world worth saving. Many criticize our species for harming others, but I remember Gerald as a boy, viewing the world's inhabitants as a family, inseparable despite their differences. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**

I discovered ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library shortly after its 1966 publication. I was immediately drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion, described as painted with 'skill and charm.' These images captivated me. I already owned other bird books and had spent holidays identifying birds, which encouraged me to sketch them. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It included chapters on migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This broad range of information and exciting images led me to appreciate birds and nature more generally. The book showed me that an emotional and creative response to nature is as valid as a scientific one. As art was my stronger subject, I saw new opportunities opening for me."
CAE_37,"Text: 'DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are crucial for publishers - they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are less upset by bad reviews. They believe that any attention, whether good or bad, can boost sales as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they are often the first to read it. Publisher B Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but their needs differ. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviewing is better now than 40 years ago, being more diverse and less elitist. However, paperbacks are often overlooked. Despite this, publishers need reviews as they are a cost-effective way to promote books. A lively review by a trusted critic can increase sales, especially if there are multiple reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands. Publisher C Reviews are vital for literary publishing; without them, we would lack an essential resource. Our books are usually not by famous authors, so we rely on literary editors for exposure. Positive reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Good reviews can boost a book's success, but they need to be combined with other factors like word-of-mouth and good marketing. Publisher D The link between publishing and reviewing in Britain is unclear. In the US, a review in the New York Times can greatly impact a book's success. In Britain, bookshops often ignore reviews. Sometimes it takes years of good reviews for a writer to gain readers, while poorly reviewed books can become bestsellers. The process is unpredictable, though non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself. Publisher E All publishers and writers hope for long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to read the book after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the unexpected choice of reviewer or the review's quality that attracts buyers.'"
CAE_2,"Text: 'WEATHERVANE MAKER The craft of making weathervanes dates back to ancient Egyptian times. Today, this skill is still alive in Graham Smith's workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates designs that are unique and tailored to his customers' needs. 'This way, I can make a personalized item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that reflects the man's work or hobbies.' This is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common for weathervanes. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, made as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends admired it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I realized that the subjects for weathervanes are endless,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles—she worked as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for the children and build the business. That was five years ago, and he has no regrets. 'My previous job lacked an artistic side, but this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I love the design aspect.' Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He works with great detail, always getting the customer's approval for the silhouette before hand-cutting it. Graham also keeps many traditional designs in stock, as they are as popular as the custom ones. 'People are drawn to hand-crafted items,' Graham says. 'They like the chance to own something unique.' Graham does not plan to expand, as he wants to keep the business a rural craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a unique touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'Pricing,' he explains, 'depends on how complex the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift.'"
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans brought him record-breaking earnings. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. His film project, *Life and Limb*, which he had been working on for months, suddenly fell apart. This was a big blow, especially since he hadn't earned any money for two years, and the film was his only hope to appease his increasingly frustrated bank manager.

In a situation like this, most people would look for a job. Evans could have returned to his previous role as a television executive or started a TV project he had put on hold. Instead, he made a bold decision that seemed crazy even to him. He bought a ticket to America to spend three months researching his first novel.

The idea for the story had been with him for a while, sparked by a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were known as ""horse whisperers,"" and Evans was fascinated.

Initially, Evans thought of writing a screenplay about it, as he was a filmmaker. But after the disappointment with *Life and Limb*, he decided to write a book instead. So, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them.

""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt very alone, and it seemed like my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about feeding my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By August, he had returned home and written the first half of the book. The bank manager was becoming more demanding, and Evans needed to know if continuing was worthwhile. He showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance.

Evans had hoped for more to pay off some debt and support his family. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and needed at least two more. $30,000 was a difficult amount to accept. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, the first 200 pages and the synopsis were sent to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'You what?' And he said, 'It's OK, I just sense something is happening.'""

What happened next became publishing history. Within a week, after intense bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were in shock. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but major studios were soon competing for it.

""My UK agent wisely involved an agent there, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" The studios agreed to this sum, and each had to ""pitch"" to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four top filmmakers called, one after the other, to bid for the unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on the verandah of his home. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is tough, and I don't want to become an employee of people I like and who have paid me so much. I'd hate to write a draft or two and then hear, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we'll bring in someone else.'""

He planned to stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel also brought new offers to back *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for the young. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer has returned to play against his old rival Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, both simple and deep. However, as the following games have shown, this older, bearded player is not the same as in 1972. He is now 49, out of practice, and not in top shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer's own influence helped make chess more professional. Now, the focus is on winning, with less emphasis on the scientific and artistic aspects. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intellect and wisdom. The game has always been intense: a chess clock ensures each player makes the required moves in time, or they lose immediately. Now, games are longer, often played without breaks, which favors younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Of the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board, not just in psychological battles that Fischer excels at. Pre-match preparation is crucial, especially with computer databases that have transformed chess. A small computer can store a million games and provide instant access to an opponent's past games. In a recent match, both players had teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are now analyzed in great detail. Being better prepared in openings can decide the game. Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, a constant struggle for the chess master. A moment of lost focus can lead to disaster. Players are always under nervous tension, and the chess clock adds to this. The end of a game often involves a frantic 'time scramble', where players have only seconds to make moves or lose. With minds racing and hands moving quickly, players make moves with coordination that any athlete would admire. These moments are not for deep thinkers. The game becomes a primal battle where nerves, determination, and a strong will to win decide the victor. At the top level, losing is painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from stress and fatigue. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready to compete the next day. Most tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even tougher. The 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow was stopped after several months due to exhaustion. Karpov lost about two stone (10kg) in weight. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his departure from chess after 1972 seem puzzling. But in some ways, it was a fitting end to his story. It made Bobby Fischer a legend. If he has returned for money, he stands to gain a lot. Whatever the outcome of his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer truly believes he can prove he is still the best, the final result could be disappointing.'"

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some of the new British talent, from poet to pop star, heading for the top.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is the author of three well-received plays. He is currently turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a screenplay. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It certainly won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as 30 quid."" Despite his talent, the most surprising thing about Nick is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never imagined it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the logistical problems. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16, only to return a year later. After A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard rather than read because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was surrounded by like-minded people. It was the first time I'd been in an educational environment and actually enjoyed myself. It was very stimulating.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has progressed significantly in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a television comedy series and has just finished a demanding tour around the country with comedy star Steve Coogan. He's always worked hard. Even back in Bristol, he was refining his skills in comedy clubs. ""It was very theoretical at university,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I'd always been more interested in comedy. People think that comedy is the hardest job in the world, and it really isn't. If you've got the courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comic team Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""He saw my show, and as I was a huge fan of his, he could probably see me mimicking him,"" admits Simon.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, gained public attention when he disco-danced into their living rooms as the lead in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The critical reaction was very positive, and his rise has been rapid. ""It's been a really good showcase for me,"" he says with a smile. ""I'm now in a situation where I can pick and choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is an unusually comfortable position, especially since he has only just graduated. But looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear such recognition was always likely. Encouraged by his mother, he went from playing lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""Basically, I was using acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" laughs Ciaran. ""But I suddenly decided I wanted to make a go of it because I had a knack for it and a passion for it."" Now he is more or less sitting back and waiting for the praise to roll in, but ask him what he thinks of fame, and he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and the interviews, but you soon realize it's not what you're acting for. It's not about that. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer in the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and the other half of Matrix, Rick Brown, are already expected to be huge when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They're talking smash hit, but I've no idea. For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop sensations, Neil has worked very hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I'd been slogging away doing student gigs for eight years, and I was starting to get a bit jaded. I was just about to give up when this happened."" By ""this,"" he means meeting Rick Brown, who already had contacts at Domino, and forming Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. ""There were times when I was thoroughly depressed—and I've been in some atrocious bands. But hopefully, it will all have been worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes, awards, and academic honors than many twice his age. He is already well known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving several readings a week for the past six years. Now his first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a very strong idea that I couldn't do as a poem."" Stephen was a huge fan of creative writing at school but became disenchanted with education later on. ""I decided not to go to university, but it wasn't until I became very bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre that I decided I should."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer—they always thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving such critical acclaim, his move into novels is indeed brave. ""There's a framework with my poetry and less scope for me to do something hideously wrong,"" he explains. ""Because a novel can be any length of words, there are more words that could be bad words. My main ambition is not to get into a pattern where I'm just churning stuff out without worrying about the quality."""

Despite her concerns, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author uses a fast-paced, dramatic style similar to early silent films, with lively chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.' B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local American radio station. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a clever but frail child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and subtle writing, transporting readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio. C. In this story, it's normal for a second husband to chat with his wife's first husband. Professor Richard Vaisey falls for a Russian poetess and shares his feelings with his wife's ex. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is wrongly imprisoned. The author skillfully untangles these issues with humor and insight, making it a sophisticated and witty read. D. Two pairs of best friends, two women and two men, meet in 1960s London and remain connected for 25 years. The novel begins with James Hudson, a mysterious American tycoon, launching a newspaper that his friend Richard Blake is editing.

The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, with well-developed characters that draw readers in. E. This touching and funny story by a top American writer follows Ian Bedloe, who, feeling guilty for a past mistake, becomes the guardian of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor surrounded by the chaos of family life. The story explores deep emotions, especially the tender bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne.

CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Academic Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. While volunteers may help build homes or schools, they usually pay a fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could fund more labor than a single volunteer can provide. This is particularly true for gap year volunteers, who often lack technical skills or professional experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are driven by a genuine desire to help or by the goal of gaining 'cultural capital' for their careers. However, these projects might still foster ethical behavior in volunteers, encouraging them to support less privileged communities in the future.

**B.** Volunteering can promote international understanding, conflict resolution, and participation in global civic society. It can also create international social networks among ordinary people. Ideally, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly accessible to people from wealthier regions, it may offer them an international perspective and career advantages, but do little for those without access to such opportunities. Volunteers may use host communities as a stepping stone for personal growth.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as imperialistic or self-serving, benefiting mainly well-off Westerners. Alternatively, it can provide technical assistance for development. At its best, it benefits both volunteers and host organizations, allowing for an exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and commitment to addressing power imbalances, poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of life strategies focused on helping others. These strategies, aimed at modestly 'making a difference,' can seem appealing in an anti-political climate. The personal approach is positive as it avoids big government and business. However, it also bypasses democratic processes and reduces development to individual charity acts, often working around rather than transforming poor, rural societies. Criticism of volunteering is misplaced if it involves simple charity. Yet, when volunteer tourism is marketed as sustainable development, it reflects a decline in development discourse. This approach shifts away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: A Review by Stuart Harris**

Many of us use a radio to wake up in the morning, often relying on a clock radio to help us get out of bed. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The first model we tested has a 'dual alarm function.' Initially, I thought this meant you could snooze with the buzzer and then get up later. However, the instructions suggest setting two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and another for weekends. This model is priced similarly to the second one we tested but includes a cassette player, which is a great deal. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We all agreed the radio quality was excellent, though the device is quite large, about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges noted, ""Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I'm paranoid and always book a wake-up call in case the alarm doesn't go off.""

This model was voted the most attractive and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" although the clock on his test model ""kept getting stuck at 16.00."" I was impressed by the digital display, with its elegant grey numbers on a gentle green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to tap even with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons, like pebbles on a beach, tempted me to play with them, which led to confusion when I finally looked at the 50-page instruction booklet. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't need to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner, which we all appreciated. However, setting it up was technically challenging, though mastering it made us feel ""cool"" and sophisticated.

Tom Granger described another model with an extra built-in lamp as ""unbelievably tacky."" ""You have to yank the light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality of the rest of it,"" he said. He had to read the instructions twice to get it working; the clock kept jumping from 12.00 to 02.00. The light was hard to position and only shines on the clock, which is already illuminated. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer reminded me of ""action stations"" on a submarine, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market.

Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching bootlace strap, this model appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. ""I would choose this one because it stands out,"" he said. The traditional design of the controls made it the only one we set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a 20-minute margin for error; the manual notes, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the pre-set time."" Paul Bridges dismissed this, calling the model ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless.""

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it ""seemed very standard and took up little space,"" and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. ""It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed all the buttons in the right order, so you can't trust it to work."" He acknowledged that manufacturers had to improve radio quality due to button-tuning. I found the tuning crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model certainly works; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Hedgehogs

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, making their spines stick out as a defense. The success of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to be lighter, so they have fewer spines and might try to run from danger, using their ball-rolling ability only if necessary. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, either under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do; if conditions are right, some stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in sports is challenging for anyone, but women often face additional hurdles. Training and competition demand significant sacrifices, leaving little time for a normal life. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight a few remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**
""It's exhilarating to fly through the air and land smoothly, though it can be frightening. Sometimes the weather is bad, but you just push through. We train for ten months a year, so it's hard to have a career outside skiing. You sacrifice a lot of your social life, but it's a choice I made. In the British team, there are six men and three women. We compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won, even though I had never cycled before! As a professional, I'm well-paid, and there are opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry people might think I succeed because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling, training at least four hours daily, plus other exercises. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitment.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**
""Rowing is tough for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most begin at 19 or 20, making international success harder. Coaches often stay only a year, so there's little continuity, and the women's squad is disorganized. But it's fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was headstrong and disliked being controlled. Now, I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the most painful experience—50 miles and 21 hours a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set the record because my sponsorship was running out. Men often see sponsoring women as riskier, thinking we're more likely to fail.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**
""Some men have big egos when driving. If I'm doing well, they ignore me. Being a woman has drawbacks; men try harder to beat me, leading to many collisions. You need to be competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have raced since the 1920s, often seen as eccentric. It's great that more women are racing now. I love aiming for perfection with each lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**
""I wake up at 5:30 a.m. three times a week to swim, using other mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous anticipation before races, and you push yourself hard. I've questioned why I do it, but I enjoy staying fit, and racing is social. Men and women usually compete together, but media coverage focuses mostly on men's events. Prize money is also less for women. We've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso

Richard Cork shares his experience of meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was an 18-year-old student. While traveling around Europe and Morocco in a van, Richard ran out of money and took a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, he saw Picasso having lunch at a restaurant in the harbor. Known for being reclusive, it was surprising to see Picasso out in public with his wife, Jacqueline, and friends.

Encouraged by a friend, Richard approached Picasso for an autograph. To his surprise, Picasso not only signed his sketchbook but also added a playful drawing. Richard, passionate about art, was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, though they needed an American woman at the table to translate.

After showing his friend the autograph, Richard was urged to return and draw Picasso's portrait. Without asking for permission, he began sketching. Picasso noticed and playfully made faces, challenging Richard's drawing skills. Eventually, Picasso settled down, allowing Richard to capture his likeness. Richard observed Picasso's youthful energy and intense gaze, despite his age.

When Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Although Richard was embarrassed, Picasso looked at it and then decided to draw Richard in return. With a few quick strokes, Picasso created a whimsical version of Richard, moving one eye onto his nose and capturing his smile with a single line.

Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt incredibly fortunate to have met Picasso and received his attention, which meant a great deal to him."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Encourage You to Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and left with more than you planned to buy? Here, we explore the strategies shops use to encourage spending.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. To create this impression, they often place fruits, vegetables, or even house plants at the store entrance. An in-store bakery might spread the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's color scheme, like using green, can also enhance this fresh image. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't fit this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With computerized stock control, supermarkets know which areas attract the most shoppers. High-profit items or fast-selling products are placed in these spots. The saying ""eye-level is buy-level"" means that shelves at eye height are prime locations for products. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters. 'Complementation' is a strategy where related items, like salad dressings and salads, are placed near each other.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets often place essential items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to pass by other tempting, higher-profit items. Similarly, chain stores might place popular products far from the entrance, relying on customer loyalty to lead shoppers through the store, exposing them to other products.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, moved away from the ""pile them high, sell them cheap"" model. Their stores have a 'boutique' feel, displaying limited items to create an exclusive impression. Despite this, Next's clothing is as mass-produced as their competitors', showing the power of good store design.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Food shoppers often focus on the total bill rather than individual prices. Supermarkets use this by offering a mix of low and high mark-up items. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. Some items, known as 'loss leaders,' are sold at a loss to attract customers. More often, low prices come from buying in bulk or meeting sales targets, which earn discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price-Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and are more aware of individual prices. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as staff must process the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for natural lighting to show clothes' true colors. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to enhance the appearance of fresh produce.

**H. Walk This Way**

Chain stores often use different flooring to guide shoppers. One pattern marks the main routes, while another defines sales areas. This 'Yellow Brick Road' approach isn't always successful, as some shoppers hesitate to leave the main path. Marks and Spencer, for example, use wood or marble for routes, encouraging shoppers to step onto the more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

As you enter a supermarket, large photos of delicious foods greet you, especially tempting if you're hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that advertise products as you shop. Sensors trigger ads relevant to the section you're in, like ready-made meals near the cook-chill cabinets. These trolleys target impulse shoppers and reportedly boost sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Chris Bonnington, a renowned mountaineer, is famous for reaching the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and authored several books, including ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, who started his sea career in the Merchant Navy, became the first person to sail solo around the world in 1968-9 with his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a transatlantic record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. Together, they embarked on a sailing and climbing expedition in Greenland, which they documented in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris contacted Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to join a sailing trip. Chris, who had never been on a yacht before, agreed. During the trip, they anchored, and Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went ashore to climb. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in challenging conditions, despite his lack of climbing experience. Robin adapted his sailing skills to climbing, using his arms more than his legs, which surprised Chris but worked safely.

This trip to Skye laid the foundation for their friendship, leading to their joint Greenland expedition. Robin, as a leader, was inclusive, consulting the crew before making decisions, which Chris appreciated. However, Chris found the sailing part tedious and preferred land adventures. He felt somewhat unnecessary on the yacht, as Robin was a natural sailor who enjoyed fixing things.

The yacht was cramped, with six people on a 32ft boat meant for four. In Greenland, when it was Chris's turn to lead, he felt the weight of responsibility for Robin's safety during climbs. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tougher than expected. Robin, not a natural climber, impressed Chris with his determination. They attempted the summit for 24 hours, facing exhaustion and danger, but Robin trusted Chris completely.

Their relationship faced a minor crisis on the return journey. Chris was supposed to take a watch shift at 4 am, but Robin let him sleep, thinking he could manage alone. Chris felt insecure, thinking Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. Through the Greenland expedition, Chris discovered Robin's kind and sensitive nature beneath his tough exterior."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been with us since ancient times, in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, the late 20th century risks losing this heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (8,000 BC)**

Humans have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In Neolithic Britain, they spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, people left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as 'windings'. They were quite different from today's apples.

**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing from the Romans, which was further developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The dessert apple, Decio, was introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apple varieties didn't suit the British climate, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks continued to develop new apples, and many Western apples today descend from these varieties.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**

In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. Its cooking counterpart was the Costard, sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the late 1600s, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a street fruit and vegetable seller. However, apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern-style orchard in Kent.

**Settler Treasure (1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh brought the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', was a famous apple planter. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. The Indians saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious devotion inspired many folktales. He was said to be so kind that he even slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**

Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a shoot growing from a dead tree's roots. It became an apple tree with a new apple, which Hiatt called 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895, it was introduced as 'Delicious' and became one of the world's most widely grown apples.

**Granny Smith (1850)**

Another famous apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith', she managed the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, 'It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish', referring to both the fruit and her convict origins.

**Uniformity (1950)**

Apples are now grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their appearance or durability rather than taste. This uniformity reduces the gene pool and numbs tastebuds. While UK gardeners have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers are now demanding more variety. We must not rely solely on amateur gardeners to preserve apple diversity. We should value and protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a mountain track leads from a quiet road from Nairobi to Mount Kenya, the country's highest peak. This area, Nanyuki, has been my base for winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands for three years. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth trip. During this visit, I competed in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp, where top runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I couldn't miss. Training at high altitude increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, a benefit proven by generations of successful Kenyan runners. My first African race, held in Nairobi, was also the continent's first international cross-country race. It was a humbling experience; 41 runners finished ahead of me, all but three were Kenyan, even though I felt I ran well. I don't think Kenyan success is only due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport. Their running style is effortless, their diet simple, and they love competing. The least discussed aspect of their success is their training method. My stay at the Kenyan team training camp revealed the answers. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mt Kenya, surrounded by playing fields and tropical vegetation. It's basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with regular students, six to a room in dormitories. Their days include three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six, with a briefing from coaches for the morning run. ""Run easy, you have a hard job today,"" we were told. They cover about 40 kilometers daily, just short of a marathon. Sundays are an exception, with only one 20-kilometer run, a welcome break from the usual three workouts. Life outside running is simple. A splash of water and brushing teeth are enough before breakfast, which includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to bathe in streams from Mt Kenya's glaciers. By the time I left, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It's not just genetics, upbringing, or altitude. I considered another explanation: the simple lifestyle, tough workouts, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in world distance running."
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline began in 1989, before the recession hit hard, and it's a global issue. The main problem is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers focus on mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become more fragmented. Even big brand campaigns should aim at smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Consider your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but only a few are advertised brands. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For consumer durables, maybe a dozen a year. Cars? If you have a new one, it's likely from your employer. If not, you buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with all the services and products you purchase, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare this to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more than £50,000 a year on advertising. The average person buys 400 of these 9,500, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4%. So, the saying ""Half of my advertising is wasted, but I don't know which half"" could be updated to ""96% of advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96%.""

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. For most, it's about 1 in 16 (6%), meaning the other 15 (94%) are wasted. You might think you're immune to advertising, but you're not alone. Most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of media advertising. It's unrealistic to think everyone will buy all the advertised brands. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable.

However, advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the relevant few, as advertisers can't predict who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with the masses. But all waste is undesirable. With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by increasing the percentage of people who respond, but they can never know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail campaigns don't get a 100% response.

This is a key difference between media advertising and face-to-face selling. A salesperson might succeed with every client, but media advertising can't achieve that. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media; they could contact them directly. This applies to all types of advertising, from personal announcements to soft drink commercials.

Any advertiser who gains one million new customers (2% of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be thrilled with a million extra customers. So, any campaign that wins over 2% of the population is very successful, even though it's a small minority. The most cost-effective way to reach them might be mass media, but for advertising to succeed again, its message must be more precisely targeted than ever before."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Solar Survivor Charles Clover explores Britain's most eco-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire holds surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is the 'autonomous house', Britain's greenest home, designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their home with waste heat from appliances and body heat from themselves, their children, and their cats, Edison and Faraday. The house, with its traditional clay pantile roof, blends with the town's nineteenth-century architecture and is located 300 yards from the Minster. Despite being in a conservation area, it was approved by planners. The solar-powered doorbell leads to a silent, super-insulated interior with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows. Inside, shoes are removed, and there is a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Vale opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow, as the house is draught-proofed, even for the cats' door. The Vales, architecture teachers at Nottingham University, have been environmentally conscious since the 1970s, writing a book called The Autonomous House. They designed a building with no carbon emissions and no mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water, which is filtered twice. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they avoid dishwashers to reduce detergent use. Their goal was to show that a house could be eco-friendly without sacrificing comfort. The house's only medieval feature is its aesthetic: a hall with a hearth and staircase that rises the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills and used only nine units of electricity a day last winter, costing about 70p. Soon, solar panels will further reduce electricity use, and the house will generate surplus electricity, enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, rarely used. In winter, the house remains warm due to its insulation and lack of draughts. Robert notes that perceived temperature depends on these factors, and people in older homes could adapt by dressing warmly, as in the past. The house is low-tech, with materials from local builders, making it affordable to build. Commercial builders resist this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a rational man, even a scientist. However, in 1920, when he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were scientific evidence of these tiny creatures' existence. He published the photos with an article he wrote, recognizing fairies as supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick challenges a basic belief about photography: that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are familiar with computer software that allows us to edit our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Blacksmiths Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and those who work with it have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they were the only ones who could make weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the intricate ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were always crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, these skills were nearly lost because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architecture rarely used elegant wrought-iron features. In the past decade, there has been a revival due to increased interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Despite this, much of the work seems clichéd, with manufacturers still promoting 'classical' or 'Victorian-style' gates and balconies. Trendy design stores often feature rusty candlesticks with decorative elements. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and upcoming events aim to promote the blacksmith's craft. The first event, an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says, 'We might be entering a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.' Power tools have freed blacksmiths from the hard labor of working over a hot anvil, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld metal more easily. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.' About 250 pieces are on display, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go into the thousands. Most of the money will go to the makers, but a portion will support the promotion of quality ironwork, says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. 'My style comes from letting steel bend and flow when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,' he says. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but becomes rigid when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans' steel door-knockers and handles seem inspired by the castles in horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And it feels like it will last forever.' No other base metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. Iron is likely to be used decoratively for the next thousand years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. 'What do you mean?' she shouted. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I guess my inability to explain how one afternoon I was a pack-a-day smoker, and four hours later I was not, was a bit annoying. I find it strange myself. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I hadn't planned to stop and I didn't even really want to. For one thing, I resented the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups - and I still do. For another, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds more easily than friends with healthier lifestyles. On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. 'I won't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I said firmly. 'Since my reason for being here is writing, not quitting, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me.' I thought I was being reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted and most of the afternoon was in a room so filled with smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke, I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others. I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping started to feel appealing. The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving, the desire for nicotine, in the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two and I experienced them for only four or five days. The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the hardest to do without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines without nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story on time. Surprisingly, spending time at home on weekend mornings was the hardest thing - and it still is. I am increasingly thinking that for me smoking had a lot to do with avoiding boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be faced - eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theatre break. All are key moments when I would have previously smoked cigarettes.'"
CAE_63,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel Prize, yet she is not widely known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, has noticed that few people recognize Hodgkin's name. This is surprising because if a British woman had won a Nobel Prize in literature, she would likely be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, such as the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When Ferry started her research, she read scientific biographies and was advised to read about Linus Pauling, a friend and contemporary of Hodgkin. Pauling, a Nobel laureate in both chemistry and peace, was not well-known in Britain, which surprised Ferry. This lack of interest in scientific biographies is partly due to the belief that scientists' lives are not as interesting as those of artists or writers. This idea is part of the 'two cultures' mentality, which suggests a divide between the arts and sciences.

However, this view is changing. Scientists are becoming more visible in the media, and scientific biographies are becoming more engaging. Richard Feynman's memoir, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", showed that scientists can have fascinating personal lives. Recent biographies of famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein have also highlighted their personal flaws and challenges.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work, achieving major breakthroughs in understanding the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin. She balanced her career with a family life, having three children and a husband who was often away. Her ability to integrate her personal and professional life is inspiring. While her personal life may not directly relate to her scientific achievements, it is still of interest.

Communicating the passion that drives scientific inquiry is challenging for biographers because many readers lack the scientific background to understand complex ideas. However, understanding science is not more difficult than learning a language or reading Shakespeare; it just requires effort. It is unfortunate that many educated people remain unaware of the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is known for her special ability to find water using a forked hazel rod. This skill, often called a 'sixth sense', makes her popular among farmers whose wells have dried up. Together with her husband, she runs a well-drilling business using modern equipment like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. Their success rate in finding water is over 90%.

Dowsing is the term for finding water, minerals, or lost objects underground. There are many theories about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. A credible theory suggests that everything vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Dowsers, like Margaret, might have a heightened ability to sense these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.

In recent drought years, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She also helps owners of remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where installing water pipes is too costly. Golf-course developers also seek her help for clubhouse facilities. Margaret aims to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. She avoids drilling where farm waste might contaminate the water. The water she finds flows through fissures in rock, ensuring a clean supply, though she must be cautious of minerals like iron in Cornwall.

Electricity is needed to power the pump, so the well should be near existing power sources. After considering these factors, Margaret starts her search. On large sites like golf courses, she uses a map and a pendulum. The pendulum swings over areas with water. Then, she walks the fields with her hazel stick. When she senses water, she feels a peculiar sensation and uses the stick to pinpoint the drilling spot. Holding the stick's forks, she applies tension. When water is directly below, the stick rises. It's crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates, as even a small error can miss the waterline. Her husband also dowses the area, and they must agree on the spot before drilling.

Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition in England. Anthropologists and writers are intrigued by this mysterious intuition. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', which helps explain her accuracy. Without this 'sixth sense', her family couldn't sustain their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"Text: 'We changed lives for a day! Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different for a change? We arranged it for four people - read about their experiences. Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a busy London restaurant. A. Amanda's story I had never been anywhere like it before. I was amazed by how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a lively atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and honestly, I wasn't sure I'd manage! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed onto the floor, spilling cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first! By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but that wasn't a problem because everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet really hurt and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say 'Pardon?', which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realized how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shy people, but in fact, you need to be quite outgoing, as well as having the ability to stay calm and deal with what is known in the trade as a 'high-volume experience' - in other words, lots of customers! I'm really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets very busy. I wasn't too impressed with the pay either. Unfortunately, I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me anything! I must admit I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing! B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I'd been warned the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. Little did I know! As Amanda left to go to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing. At 1 pm I picked up Katie, rushed around the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the sofa into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they could! I decided to take the relaxed approach, thinking they'd soon get tired. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down! After much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink, for heaven's sake? Of course, I realized it was just a trick so they could come downstairs and watch television, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never realized how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sheer sense of responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day. Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school. C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was pure luxury! But I hesitated for ages about how to look. I could hardly turn up in overalls and boots, could I? Looking at a sea of faces -- about 400 pupils -- at assembly, I hoped I blended into the background and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm. After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables in unison! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails. By lunchtime, I was exhausted and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practice on me, which really showed up my rusty French. Finally, we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy. The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming, anyway! D. Hilary's story I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers, and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants, and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons, and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself from dipping my fingers into the goodies! At lunchtime, it was time to inspect the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe that had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over they could die, so they have to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't answer back! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems romantic but the reality is very different. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.'"
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new works. When you meet him, he appears younger than his age, with a fresh and open manner, much like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, and a television feature focused on his work and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother contacted the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, to teach her son. Nilsson, an emerging musician, immediately recognized Hardenberger's talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher who was passionate about the trumpet and connected with players worldwide. Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a primitive instrument with imperfections, and it's about understanding and working with them. From the start, he had the ability to find the right balance and develop his unique sound. Unlike John Wallace, a great British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also focused on solo performances. His parents supported his ambition to make a career in trumpet playing. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was considered too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud reinforced his desire to avoid orchestras, comparing it to 'digging in the garden.' Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but it was during his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special gift for communication. Thibaud suggested entering the competition for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round and advanced to the second, where he knew most of the pieces. In the final, he faced a challenging concerto. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that even if he 'played like a pig,' people listened to him. His realism about his work might seem arrogant, but that's not true. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift for communication, believing that trying to explain it could ruin it. The power of music lies in its ability to move people.'"
CAE_33,"Text: 'New In Paperback A. The story of citizen Tristan Smith takes place in the fictional republic of Efica. It is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author has skillfully created a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique vision, combined with deep psychological insight. It is a challenging but rewarding read. B. Harriet is a poised, middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would never have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss the incident. Leo, who was a model student and had never fought before, won't explain his actions, while Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's condition, and caring for him consumes her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks for a meeting, leading to an unusual friendship. The author excels at showing how people react to major changes in their lives and captures the mothers' feelings of inadequacy. C. Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, this book follows the history of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people. The story is set against key moments in Scottish history, imagined through the daydreams of the young protagonist, Thorfinn Ragnarson. He disappears at one point in the book, only to return after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors. D. After his recent bestseller, the author has written a sequel with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies with her lively companion, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life is still a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, with Rosie as her ally in managing suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the rise of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness beneath the ordinary aspects of life, focusing on the shadows rather than the bright moments and highlighting the randomness of events. E. Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author, with her impressive descriptive language, explores the personal journeys of self-discovery each of these sailors undergoes. They return home with their spirits renewed by their time on 'the desert cities of waves'. The author uses striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both alienating and enlightening.'"

I operate all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and some Friday afternoons. Most head surgeries take three hours, but some can last all day. I've worked ten hours straight without eating or using the bathroom. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. I don't feel stressed while operating, but I sometimes worry about the next day's tasks. Brain surgery is often a last resort, but when successful, it's very rewarding. From 10 am to 1 pm, I have an out-patients' clinic where I explain operations. I enjoy talking to patients, but time pressure can make it hard to comfort them if they're upset. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I'm on call and always carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first few days about my patients, and I dream about operating.

Only 10-15% of the work is design; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client, then spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting my ideas to the client and getting approval, we set budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers to ensure everything is on time. Managing people is a big part of my job, and clear communication is crucial. I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Handling multiple projects can be very stressful. Deadlines are always near, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, often at a pub. If not, I have sandwiches and work through. It's great when a client likes your work, but disappointing if it's rejected. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. It's hard to relax when I'm busy."" C.

Around 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is sedentary, I watch my diet and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snack during the day. People often ask for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know my way around. Many jobs are pre-booked, so I can plan routes. Not everyone is polite; some passengers are rude. But most are well-behaved, and I have a good rapport with regular clients. Sometimes I overhear conversations and have to focus on driving. The press has tried to get me to talk about clients, but I don't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and try not to get too tired. I aim to be in bed by 11 pm."" D.

In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. The business office is at home, so I check messages and return calls when I get back. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I arrange an evening consultation. We use old materials and unusual plants to make gardens look aged. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren't great. It's satisfying to see a garden completed and blooming. It's hard to relax in the evenings because I hear the business phone. I sleep well because the work is so physical. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. It's a tough job, but it lets my imagination run wild."" E.

My duties include launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I maintain contact with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and responding to emails. I oversee advertising for the membership program across Europe, meeting with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. My day is filled with meetings, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different European markets once or twice a week to address issues. In London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I start work at 10:00 am, reviewing the post, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. Calls begin around 10:30 am from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day about campaigns or projects for artists. When listening to demo tapes, I try to be constructive, knowing it's someone's life's work. I can tell if the sound suits our label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I communicate my vision for the album to the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often attend gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After gigs, I might visit an artist in the studio. My social life revolves around work, and I often get home by 1:00 am, where I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the post and diary to see if we have client visits. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques ranging from £1,000 to £6,000, buying from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with gilders, framers, and repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette during coffee breaks to stay updated and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts monthly and do tax returns quarterly. I go home at 5:30 pm, taking about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work set shifts, leaving home at 6:00 am for early shifts. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a break before returning to a different station. The team includes air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and a watch manager, all working together to control aircraft movements. We handle about 1,000 movements daily in winter, more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing time to read up on new air traffic requirements. It's crucial to be alert, so I don't hesitate to call in sick if I'm unwell. The job is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I aim to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager at the airport.

For early shifts, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system and ensure someone is at the till. I coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend mornings helping customers and ordering books. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be frustrating when they expect me to gather books based on reviews. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' reps visit, and I discuss new titles, considering how many copies the shop might sell. It's crucial to ensure new titles are delivered on time.

My first executive preview is due online by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I quickly follow up on stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, then make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay informed. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but it's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires and guides change. Leadership isn't about appearance or intelligence. Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, says leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are.' Enthusiasm is crucial, and a good leader should speak confidently and with conviction. Dixon suggests saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. **Recognizing Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, believes most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing, developing, and using these talents. While we easily see leadership in figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is essential for effective management.

C. **Reflect on Leadership Experiences**  
Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. Both may have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines, but how did they achieve them? The best leader motivated and supported you, while the worst made you feel insignificant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second managed poorly.

D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers work within set boundaries, while leaders create new horizons. Michael Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes that a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can transform a demoralized organization, whether it's a company, a team, or a nation.

E. **Improving Leadership Skills**  
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, improving leadership skills is beneficial. Here are some lessons:  
- Leadership is best when chosen. Find your passions and act on them when inspired.  
- See yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.  
- While collaboration is good, sometimes firm leadership is needed. Experiment with your style. If you're a natural transactor, try negotiating. If you usually seek others' views, try leading. Notice how outcomes change.  
- Set and exceed goals. Identify job demands where leadership enhances effectiveness and career prospects.

F. **Developing Leadership**  
- Leadership develops by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.  
- Don't assume your leadership style will immediately win over colleagues. It might alienate them. Work on communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and accomplishments should be.  
- Be visible and accessible to important people. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and help others develop as leaders."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The witty and brave foreman Bud and his team remind us of the cool heroes in Howard Hawks' films. The production design and special effects are impressive, but the dialogue and character development are lacking. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of Andrew Marton's adaptation of James Jones' novel about the battle for Guadalcanal offers an interesting contrast to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often truer to the book. It focuses on a single soldier and his tough sergeant. Although Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's has its highlights. The flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife is portrayed with a harshness that might be more effective than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler stands out among musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a perfect villain, a scheming politician causing chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively, though short-lived, hero, and Daniel Auteuil, despite being a bit too serious for this type of film, shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such wit and energy that it remains enjoyable.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film is a handsome but somber tale. The detailed production and costume design make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless in evicting tenants. The tense relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on period details, neglecting the dark and intense narrative.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is exceptional, with every footstep and creak clearly heard. The storytelling is relentlessly harsh, and whenever there's a pause, Morricone's powerful music revives the excitement. Morally, there's little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck boasts 'forty-eight international stars.' With four directors and 23,000 extras, it's an overdone production. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, feel as slow for the audience as for the characters. Logistically impressive, it lacks aesthetic appeal and is best suited for the big screen.

CAE_57,"Text: 'I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He wonders why he and others his age decide to take this step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned, I was determined to do it again someday. But you know how it is... I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. But I gradually realized I had been sacrificing my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in my resignation letter, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I now have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no strong career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake! Why am I so nervous? First, it's about making the necessary arrangements. How could I bear to have someone else living in my home? And how would I organize the letting? And apart from anything else, I had to decide where to go. I'm a terrible procrastinator and am already several weeks behind my intended schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Cutting emotional ties makes it even more difficult. I'm putting it off because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a more basic way of life? Will I feel out of place among a community of backpackers fresh out of school and university? Perhaps not. I've discovered it's increasingly common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to break free from the lives they've built and head off to foreign places. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, notes a growing awareness that adventure is there for the taking: 'People are realizing they can have the opportunity anytime they want. They just have to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.' For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have a final adventure before settling down. They have bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm prepared to sacrifice job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a thought at the back of your mind that, ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'll be in the same position when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a ceremonial act of defiance!' For Matt, who'd just left the Army, the year he spent traveling was a period of transformation. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things, a pattern to how you approach problems. I went away because I needed to change this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, to have a reasonable life as a civilian.' While there are as many reasons to go traveling at my age as there are travelers, there seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts, so if your contract's just ended, you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.' For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specializes in the stories of 'ordinary' travelers, more thirty-somethings are reassessing their lives. 'If you're not happy doing what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer about just sticking it out. Now people know that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to step back and think about your life.' Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to accept adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paying the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading off to Central America for a year, doesn't believe he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and sitting down with a cup of coffee.' I share Ben's concerns about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst, like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.' It may have taken a helpful push to get me moving, but I'm now approaching the next 12 months with growing excitement. Whatever the outcome, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having seized life by the horns. And in that, I'm sure I speak for all of us older backpackers.'"
CAE_42,"Text: 'Plugging in the Home Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the technological changes. She shares how she turned her family home into an efficient workplace. The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which seemed lost in the technological age. My resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the norm. It seemed unlikely anyone would hire me to work on a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required desktop publishing experience, which I lacked. I felt more capable of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than designing a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators confused me, and I couldn't use the video timer. Clearly, my career had a big gap, and I needed to act fast. Leaving home before the children did seemed difficult until I entered a local newspaper competition. Like a success story that happens to others, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family, diving into a new world where terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became common. We started chatting online with strangers worldwide. The children abandoned TV, and I set up a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone-answering machine, fax, CD-ROM, and modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything needed to work from home and still take the children to school. They were confident with computers, having learned at school. I was hesitant, fearing I would lose all my work with one wrong button. I was wrong. Though not skilled, I learned the basics—it was logical, easy, and foolproof. With perseverance, I learned more each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel I have the best of both worlds. How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk was always a chaotic mess, and I often lost important notes. The computer made me organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads save time. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide. If this sounds too good to be true, there is a downside to working from home. You can feel isolated from human contact. There are distractions like household chores, and when the children are home, we argue over computer time. However, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment. In my street, a new type of home-based industry is emerging, avoiding the daily commute to the city. So, what defines home workers as we enter the next century? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes describes the typical computer user as 38 and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I seem ahead of the curve. Who knows, one day I might email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or rather cyberspace, is the limit.'"
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern, cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are its contents as striking? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You can't miss it. The Museum of Scotland is unmissable, located on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large, yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings, topped by a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some praised it as a modernist masterpiece, others were cautious, and some were hostile. This winter, as the inside is nearly ready for opening, the exhibitions might receive similar reactions.

Forget the debate about whether it tells a nation's story or is chronological. The answer is yes; it presents a rich tapestry of stories, each centered around a historic object, with a timeline to guide visitors without restricting the displays. It doesn't let national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver, get overshadowed by national pride.

The real question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, insists that a visit should be a pleasurable, visual experience, designed for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this, Clarke is a purist about what is shown. He avoids mock-ups and imaginative scenes from the past, believing they give a false sense of certainty about history. He says, ""The public deserves the truth."" So, at this museum, what you see is what experts know.

The question for visitors is whether the objects' stories can be told vividly enough with explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, using only about 30 computers throughout the museum. Less than three days before opening, it's still hard to be sure. Some impressions are clear, though, and it's not just the panoramic views of Edinburgh Castle that are impressive.

Inside, the sequence of spaces is striking. Galleries open into one another, with different sizes and shapes, pale wood-paneled walls resembling large stone blocks, and deep display cases. Daylight streams through narrow windows and roof lights. There's room to appreciate every item on display.

Thanks to a 12-member Junior Board, set up three years ago with 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum has a Discovery Centre. The group wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a dedicated children's hands-on center in what was meant to be the temporary exhibition gallery. As a result, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change after three years and is a mix of objects chosen by Scottish people and other personalities as items that impacted life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister suggested an electric guitar, while others chose televisions, Thermos flasks, and favorite toys. Although the idea is fun, it feels like a lightweight solution, not a serious attempt to address important issues. It may seem more substantial when the computerized bank of personal reasons and recollections goes live next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke seems right when he suggests that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modernist architecture: it works brilliantly from the inside and the top, but whether it fits the location is another question."
CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition is a comforting idea. Change can be scary for some and challenging for others. But transition suggests a smooth move from the present to the future. However, when it comes to newspapers moving online, this transition is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe it will happen eventually, as print newspaper sales are dropping while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8% to 10% year-on-year, but their websites are gaining more visitors. This trend depends on factors like timing, demographics, and geography. Experts from both the web and print industries agree on this shift. Yet, there are some inconsistencies. Global newspaper circulation actually rose by 1.1% last year, with Asia compensating for declines in the West. News magazines, expected to suffer in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase. Similarly, e-readers like Kindle are popular, but physical book sales only dropped by 0.4%. It seems both digital and print formats are thriving. Claims that young people are abandoning newspapers are exaggerated. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read national dailies. Different countries show different trends. In Britain, print sales fell by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline was only 7%, and in France, just 3.1%. These variations suggest a more complex situation than expected. In the US, online advertising was once thought to support the shift to digital, but digital ad revenues are now declining. As a result, 360 US newspapers have introduced paywalls. The most successful strategy seems to be offering print and digital access together. Print remains important for selling online subscriptions and generates much higher advertising revenue than online. This situation is challenging for newspaper companies, as maintaining both print and digital editions is costly. However, print still plays a key role in maintaining a newspaper's visibility, which is harder to achieve online.'"
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most fascinating subjects to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than one without. However, capturing people well in photos is challenging. Beyond technical and artistic aspects, photographers must be aware of actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera's presence can negatively affect these.

**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Have people stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or raise your viewpoint.

**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera, becoming stiff. Help your subject relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding hands or putting them in pockets.

**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you're not taking a picture when you clearly are, as this creates tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, though they might protest initially. They may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away, drawing interest elsewhere.

**D. EYE CONTACT**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily smile. They might not maintain this for long, so remind them before you take the shot. You can also say something funny or unexpected for a genuine reaction.

**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**

Instead of direct eye contact, have the subject focus on something within the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are intriguing, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures reveal much about the subject. A laughing child, even if poorly dressed, can make the viewer smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. SITUATION INTEREST**

While close-up shots of faces are impactful, including the subject's environment can add interest. When using a background, exclude irrelevant details or blur them. Ensure the subject isn't overshadowed by the background; a wide-angle lens can help balance the subject and background.

**H. INTERACTION**

When people are interacting—talking, arguing, or working together—there are opportunities for great photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams can make appealing shots. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a hand on an arm, or wait for an expressive gesture.

**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**

Many photos of people are taken on holidays to show the places visited. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask subjects to come close to the camera, forming a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help balance the subjects and the place.

**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a good background. Family photos can be dull if they are just formal poses. Candid shots of events are more lively, especially when you know the subject well. A spontaneous picture can evoke memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"Text: 'Under Sarah's Spell Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means her paintings create an illusion of reality to trick the eye. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her. Unlike most artists, Sarah Janson doesn't sign her work unless asked. She believes the art is more important than the artist. Janson is very modest, almost as if her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a challenging interview subject. She admits, ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" and is uncomfortable being photographed. However, once she relaxes, the interview becomes engaging and humorous. Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration didn't fulfill her, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart, who introduced her to trompe-l'oeil. This sparked her passion, and she started her own business, feeling she was on the right path. Her skills in observation and detail, honed through illustration, are crucial for trompe-l'oeil. Janson believes trompe-l'oeil can't be taught; it's about observing life. She insists she's still learning and is honest about her limitations, like struggling to paint bread. When working on a large project for a chapel ceiling, she doubted herself, thinking, ""You're not Michelangelo."" This self-questioning leads her to speak about her work in the third person, as if someone else created it. Janson's work stands out in the trompe-l'oeil revival, with many corporate and private commissions. Her art often draws inspiration from architecture, like a dining room based on a Venetian palace or a painting that creates the illusion of extra rooms. Trompe-l'oeil must first trick the viewer and then engage their imagination. Janson believes it should also be personal to the client, and she enjoys collaborating with them. Many clients become friends, as she often works closely with them. Janson appreciates her clients, especially those who give her creative freedom. Despite her modesty, she is always busy, as clients are pleased with her work. She repeats, ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" preferring her work to speak quietly. While she may not seek attention, her art deserves recognition, and I am happy to praise her talent.'"
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' crucial for professional success.

**A**

The rules at work are changing. We are now judged not only by our intelligence or expertise but also by how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard helps decide who gets hired or promoted. It predicts who will excel and who might not. These skills are vital for future job opportunities, regardless of our current field. Unlike what we learned in school, doing well in exams is not enough. This new measure assumes we have the necessary intellectual and technical skills. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—collectively known as emotional intelligence.

**B**

In a world where job security is uncertain, personal qualities are increasingly important. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills' in the past. Now, they are better understood as 'emotional intelligence', which is the ability to manage our own and others' emotions and use them to guide actions. In work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Emotional intelligence is not just about 'being nice'. Sometimes it requires confronting uncomfortable truths. It also doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely. Instead, it involves managing emotions so they are expressed effectively, helping people work together towards common goals.

**C**

Many businesses now see emotional intelligence as essential to management. The more complex the job, the more important these skills become. Lack of emotional intelligence can hinder the use of technical skills or intellect. While some people succeed despite flaws in emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that foster these skills gain a competitive advantage. In today's workplace, with its focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is crucial for success in any job worldwide.

**D**

Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow throughout life as we learn from experiences. Studies show that people generally improve in managing emotions, motivating themselves, and developing empathy and social skills. This growth is often called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned and added to our skills for survival, especially when job stability is uncertain. While it is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human element can hinder overall success."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often breaks on social networks, and some journalists use them to find images during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Official guidelines say images from social media can be used without permission in exceptional cases or if there is strong public interest, but there is still debate about whether this is ethical. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

**Acupuncture's Origins and Uses**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old, originating from traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat various conditions, but its effectiveness in pain relief has gained the most attention in Western medicine. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for this purpose.

**Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine**

In traditional Chinese medicine, health is seen as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, known as Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that distribute Qi throughout the body. If the flow of Qi is disrupted, it can lead to imbalance and illness. During an acupuncture session, the practitioner identifies where these imbalances occur by checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and assessing your overall appearance. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, and lifestyle habits. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin, sometimes with added warmth or pressure, to stimulate the flow of Qi.

**Acupuncture Points and Sensations**

The points used in acupuncture are linked to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. Patients often report a dull ache or tingling when the needle is manipulated, either by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. This sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred main acupuncture points, with many more used less frequently.

**Scientific Explanations**

While Western doctors may not fully accept traditional Chinese principles, they acknowledge acupuncture's effectiveness in pain relief. Scientific explanations suggest that acupuncture may work by stimulating nerves to block pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Acupuncture is often sought by those with chronic pain, such as back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and post-operative pain. It is also claimed to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Applications**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some Western doctors of its potential beyond psychological effects. In China, acupuncture is used in various surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs, to reduce pain without the side effects of conventional anesthetics.

**Effectiveness and Trials**

Clinical trials for acupuncture are challenging to conduct, but those that exist show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists acknowledge that it may not work for everyone and that responses vary. For chronic pain, noticeable relief usually occurs after six or seven sessions, with some improvement after two or three.

**Holistic Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine approach pain differently. Acupuncturists view patients holistically, considering not just symptoms but also underlying weaknesses in Qi and external factors like weather conditions. This comprehensive approach is less common in conventional Western medicine.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others rely on scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by following Chinese medicine principles can deep, lasting changes be achieved. When choosing an acupuncturist, ensure they are qualified and willing to refer you to a medical doctor if necessary."
CAE_35,"Text: P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer known for her complex and imaginative stories. Despite her quiet and authoritative presence, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is somewhat based on herself, imagining how she might have been if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing, needing complete privacy to focus.

Although she is considered one of Britain's most famous crime writers, with 12 major detective novels read by millions worldwide, she remains humble. She admires the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. Her reading preferences include books by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male authors such as Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.

P.D. James found success later in life. Now in her seventies, she published her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" at the age of 42. Born in Oxford and raised in Cambridge, she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. Life was challenging after her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters. Her husband's parents helped care for the children during these tough times.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office, she used her organizational skills effectively. Her work in forensic science exposed her to the realities of crime, but it was the structure of writing crime novels that attracted her. She always wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to bring order to chaos. Writing these stories allowed her to explore human nature within the framework of a classic detective story, without drawing directly from her own life's hardships. She believes that solving a crime in a story affirms the value of life, even if the life in question is not particularly lovable."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. This sample could play a significant role in determining your suitability for the position. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is considered a legitimate science in many places. Researchers claim it can help identify certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and reveal psychological states and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is increasingly used for career guidance and as a supplement to interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of potential candidates for important jobs. However, most doctors and psychiatrists remain skeptical about the value of graphology.

Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can indicate psychological traits and certain medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: ""Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times. I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.""

""Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides."" Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. ""You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred."" A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form ""threads"" instead of being individually formed are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting—how far the writer has deviated from copybook script—indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner. Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronizing attitude.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, and this must be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing. This will happen soon, she believes. ""It's actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.""

Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught—and has no other significance."
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and the right chairs are essential for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to assess their health and happiness as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their findings.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open directly to the street. Despite this, the small, dynamic team seems content. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric radiators, much like at home. This homely environment, free from external bureaucracy, might be the key to their happiness.
Ergonomist: The furniture is mismatched and often leads to poor working postures. Chairs are old, mostly non-adjustable, and many are broken. However, the varied work schedule, which includes office tasks, client meetings, and presentations, helps reduce fatigue and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They find the office 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, yet large enough for personal focus. The office is both attractive and fun, promoting efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and not disliked by staff. Air quality and maintenance are good, supported by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are excellent. Space is adequate, though layout could improve. The environment is impersonal with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for planners and a maternity rights poster. Staff relationships are satisfactory, with most employees there for over five years. Desk arrangement could improve information sharing. Success stories or project information could be displayed.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, viewing and being viewed by similar setups. Despite smokers and non-smokers sharing a small space, the air is not stale. Even near a smoker, cigarette smell is minimal.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are barely adequate. Not all chairs meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is outdated.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are supportive and well-served by technology. Communication awards are displayed. The wood paneling and brown carpet create a sombre effect, but the office is busy.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It's hard to say anything positive. The air-conditioning is crude, causing temperature variations. The space is cluttered with inadequate desk space. The office is dusty, with dust collecting on the shed-type roof, which can fall on those below.
Ergonomist: The furniture is more suited to a workshop than a high-tech office. Most chairs are unsuitable for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack adjustment, and have armrests that prevent getting close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. There's much room for improvement—tidying up, recognizing individual success, and improving air conditioning are needed, especially with many smokers. Few conversations were happening; everyone seemed stressed and deadline-driven. The company should adopt team-working policies.'"
CAE_38,"Chewing Gum Culture

Chewing gum is popular and classless, with Americans consuming 12 million sticks daily. Learn how this ancient practice became a major industry. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the American Food and Drug Administration's standards. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to maintain flavor and texture. However, this wasn't always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey, to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Amero-Indians of New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce lumps were sold in the eastern United States, marking the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in the Central American rainforest. This gum was smoother, more satisfying, and more elastic, leading to the birth of a new industry. However, attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed, and as the market grew, synthetic alternatives were developed. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, live a difficult and dangerous life, traveling long distances to tap scattered sapodilla trees in nearly 100% humidity. They face many dangers, including poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly, which lays eggs in the tappers' ears and nose, is particularly troublesome. Despite these hazards, chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which is then boiled into bricks at forest camps. Life at these camps is tough, with a monotonous maize-based diet and local alcohol made from sugar cane.

Despite the harsh conditions, chicleros worry about their future. The United States once imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle annually from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were tapped in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetics to cut costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. Gum is said to help you relax, boost energy, and reduce tension. It was even supplied to soldiers during both world wars. Its greatest claim is that it reduces tooth decay by increasing saliva flow, which neutralizes plaque acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Research continues on new textures and flavors, with glycerine and other vegetable oils used to blend the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of America are dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian symbolism. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided by bucket, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**

The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favorites. I discovered it by chance while climbing. After a long descent from a glacier, I was surprised to find this hotel in such a stunning, wild location. It was a luxury to arrive exhausted and hear someone playing Cole Porter on the piano.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**

Located on a peninsula in the southwest of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is in a quiet area. The road to the hotel winds along deserted beaches. Although the hotel is large and offers free watersports, you can find solitude on its nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, as the light fades, you feel far from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**

The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia offers one of the Caribbean's most dramatic views. Situated 1,000 feet above sea level, its open rooms overlook the Pitons and the Caribbean Sea. The style is colonial, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**

On Buyukada in the Princes Islands, the Splendid Hotel is a perfect escape from Istanbul's noise. Just an hour by boat, the islands are idyllic, with no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful 1920s wooden architecture. The hotel, painted white with red domes, is a replica of a French Riviera hotel. Though a bit worn, it retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**

In the village of Etoges, in the heart of Champagne, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with swans, it was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one with a billiard table. Special weekend rates include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**

The Fairview Hotel in Nairobi is a comfortable place without excessive luxury. It's a popular stop for travelers between safaris. Some guests decide to stay longer after seeing the gardens and rooms. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the city's hustle. It's a great place to watch the sunset with a drink and enjoy a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**

The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guest book at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet a billionaire or heiress. This former monastery-turned-hotel is still splendid, with simple food, fine Persian rugs, and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just a minute into the inspection, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy quoting room rates over the phone and doesn't notice Sue, which she finds very poor. This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel is not just any three-star hotel; it has three red stars, placing it among the top 130 of 4,000 hotels in the guide published by Sue's organization. 

The initial experience is disappointing. The entrance from the car park is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. Sue is not impressed. Things worsen when the receptionist can't find Sue's booking, even though most rooms are unoccupied. The room offered is stuffy, and there's a large hole in the wall behind a wardrobe panel.

Sue recalls being known as ""The Woman in Black"" for her tough reputation, though she insists she was never too harsh. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel's general manager, Robin Greaves. He is visibly worried. Before Sue can say much, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge, suspecting a blocked drain. Sue suggests not using that lounge until it's fixed. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He's been at the hotel for only five months and struggles to see the positive side of Sue's critique.

Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a young waitress, for their good service. The dinner maintains the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks what they need to do to earn three rosettes. Sue suggests improvements, like not serving a pudding that collapses. 

Sue's job is to voice complaints that others might not dare to express. She recalls a complaint from a woman whose son lost his job after serving her apple pie with his fingers. Sue often receives letters with false accusations, but she says it still hurts. She must provide a full written report of her findings to the hotel, as they pay for this service. Despite the criticism, being in the guide with red stars is valuable for the hotel.

Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue won't recommend removing the Globe's red stars. However, another inspector will return in two months to check on improvements. Greaves smiles, though not convincingly, and says they look forward to it."
CAE_48,"**Seven Up: Conquering the Seven Summits**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. His journey began later in life, and he recounts each climb in the order he completed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While in a snow cave near the summit, Doug's partner, Dougal Haston, started a conversation with an absent team member, likely due to oxygen deprivation. Doug also found himself talking to his feet, worried about frostbite. Despite the challenges, Doug felt confident with Dougal by his side and managed to reach the summit by finding a better climbing rhythm.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Considered one of the most dangerous mountains, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier in April 1976. They decided to climb 'alpine style,' carrying all their gear. The lower air pressure made the climb feel much higher than it was. After enduring harsh conditions, they reached the summit and descended successfully.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite intended to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro due to a free ride. They got lost in the jungle, struggling with scarce water. Eventually, they found a trail and reached the summit via the Umbwe route after avoiding a dangerous icicle climb.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, joined a group led by Phil Erscheler to climb Aconcagua via the Polish Glacier. Due to time constraints, they opted for the standard route instead. After reaching the summit, Doug met climbers aiming for the Seven Summits, inspiring him to pursue the same goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Realizing that guiding others could fund his climb, Doug set out for Vinson Massif in November 1992. Despite harsh weather, the team reached the summit in eight hours. The experience was exhilarating, though visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In early summer 1994, Doug's team gathered in St Petersburg. After acclimatizing, they took a cableway to 3,900m and hiked to a refuge at 4,200m. Battling strong winds, they reached what they thought was the summit, only to find another ridge to the true peak. They returned to the refuge as night fell.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
Doug's expedition aimed to establish a new route and connect with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they proceeded. On May 12, they climbed in improved weather, reaching the summit by 11 am. This marked Doug's completion of the Seven Summits, celebrated with a standing ovation. Mission accomplished!"

Style influences every aspect of our lives today, from clothing to home decor and accessories. Jo Foley gives us a glimpse of this year's fashion trends.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**

Ned Ingham creates dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. He advises against traditional, stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look, suggesting simpler styles instead. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. At 16, he attended fashion school to learn the skills needed to cut and make clothes. But you don't have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses with modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer a more traditional look, Ingham offers a classic summer navy-blue suit, a staple in English women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century. In his hands, it looks as fresh as tomorrow.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

Sally Quail, who once worked for an art dealer, has no formal training in jewelry. She started designing when she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked. The interest in her designs led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many stage and screen stars seek out her pieces. Her signature style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, inspired by 18th-century jewelry. Recently, she has started using diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36-year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond, and that's when I began working with them.'

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**

Just four years after entering the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson, with only an introductory course in art and design, has had two of her creations featured in a major design exhibition. Her designs, regardless of shape and form, always stand out. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK. A Grimson handbag is not just a container; it exudes glamour, whether made from the finest calfskin or the heaviest silk. A blend of style and craftsmanship makes a Grimson bag special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of some of the world's most famous people. 'Most women want natural-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. His approach is unique - ensuring his clients never look like they've just left a salon. However, this effortless look comes at a price - £250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Capitalizing on his fame, Peter has launched his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who can't visit his salon to create their own styles at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain, providing floral ideas to top restaurants. This is impressive for someone with no formal floristry qualifications who left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her simple yet modern creations have won numerous design awards in the flower industry, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has recently combined her skills on successful lecture tours in Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are much simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong, and don't use too many leaves - they are too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, the golden rule is: the flowers must be of the same species.'"
FCE_19,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the installation of the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but for specific preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. MacCann praises its efficiency, noting that a guest who requests certain music CDs during their first stay will find them ready on their next visit. This is possible due to the guest-history feature that records preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. The Merrion has a high-tech system to manage this. Guests can adjust the temperature within three degrees of the standard 18°C, and the front desk can further adjust it between 14°C and 25°C. However, it is the in-room technology that impresses guests the most, especially business travelers. MacCann estimates that 65% of the hotel's business will come from this market. To cater to them, each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.

Technology evolves rapidly, so the hotel has prepared for future upgrades. Extra cables are in place for new advancements, and televisions are rented to allow easy replacement with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated as needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann ensures that guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

As with all luxury hotels, excellent food is essential. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his business to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel. He designed a modern kitchen and enjoys better parking facilities. For the hotel, having a popular restaurant on-site is a great advantage without financial risks. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set for success."
FCE_24,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly, spreading seeds throughout the garden. The garden has a harmonious mix of colors, shapes, and structures, especially in the two long flower borders along the path. This harmony is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also inherited their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" Initially, Danny was skeptical about some of her choices, but he understood her vision when she explained she wanted to paint them.

Susan focuses on detailed studies of individual plants rather than the entire garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants in their natural setting, but often she picks them and takes them to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another."" Completing a painting can take years. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the process of flowers decaying fascinating. For example, tulips change shape and become more interesting after being in water for a day.

Susan has always been interested in plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers then, thinking they looked artificial. She admired how wildflowers grew in difficult places like rock cracks or cliff tops. Now, her garden includes plants from distant lands, which thrive as if they were in their native China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, similar to an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects at her doorstep, Susan finds it hard to spend time gardening. She has hired an extra gardener but believes that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area were knocked down during the severe storms in March. The town lost two significant lime trees from the old market square, changing the town center's look, which upset some of the more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind even toppled the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too ill to notice. A usually healthy man, he was seriously ill with bronchitis for the first time. When he first felt a headache and chest tightness, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. Believing the police force needed him, he ignored her and continued working. This only worsened his condition, affecting his memory and temper. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to get his prescribed antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, Pelham couldn't process it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked about damage to the house, was relieved to hear there was none, and went back to sleep. It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, his fever dropped, and he got up, that he realized the walnut tree's loss had permanently changed the living-room's appearance. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The leafy garden gave a sense of privacy. Now, the storm had changed his view. Before, the living-room view included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't darken the room because there was another window on the opposite wall, but it created interesting light patterns that hid the worn furniture the family brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room was harshly bright, showing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was now dominated by the tall house next door, previously hidden by the tree, with its unattractive purple bricks and external pipes. It seemed to have many upstairs windows, all watching the Pelhams' every move. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham croaked to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more pleased than upset. ""That's what I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"Text: 'Living in the Valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts; trees swayed, but the branches stayed firm. Yet, we knew we had reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they didn't trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago. Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was gradually washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and nearing danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was wild beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we'd ever seen it near our home, fiercely hitting its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down. Many times before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, all is well; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind its barrier with just occasional overflow. We can enjoy, rather than fear, the large clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.'"
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his decade-long career at The Front Page newspaper. Writing about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviewing—novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and TV. He hired me, but Tom wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have been more selective with his staff. Initially, his idea was to have a team of critics handle art forms that didn't need specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have weekly lunches to choose from the artistic material Tom wanted us to cover, with guests to keep things sociable. It all felt like a dream then: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. It felt just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with one of my reviews, I didn't know where to look. Tom's plan for a team of arts critics never materialized. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, we wouldn't have the current setup, where I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn't have been interested in the typical film critic's role, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That routine would quickly make me lose interest. I would soon be sinking into my seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What terrible film must I watch now?'—a sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide. The space I have allows me to expand my argument—or forces me, in a dull week, to create something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume people choose films based on the stars, publicity, or director. There's also loyalty to a 'type' or its opposite. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romance fan to avoid a love story because of a review. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I don't feel responsible for being 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a set number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. My job is to present an argument. I'm not a judge, nor would I want to be."
FCE_46,"Text: Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a passion for endurance sports WANTED: Sports-enthusiastic training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Opportunity to train with a potential Olympic champion. Must be very interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoys winter training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (enjoys 100km rides). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km without stopping. It might be exciting for spectators, but what motivates triathletes to push their bodies so hard? And why would a talented 17-year-old with excellent academic results give up everything for the challenging experience it offers? Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge, and higher goals that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second-fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will cover the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her intense training sessions have made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events. She has attempted the triathlon ""sprint,"" for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,"Text: 'The Collectors Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with passion and excitement. But remember, only collect items you truly love. Since ancient times, humans have felt the urge to collect. Early humans collected pebbles, attracted by their shapes and colors, as a form of intellectual and spiritual expression. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty. I have been a collector all my life, gathering everything from tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I attended a school in a remote, windy part of England. My parents would take me to a local museum filled with historical collections, which fascinated me. Many adults share this interest in collecting. Some people collect because it gives them a sense of control in their lives. For me, it's simply enjoyable. A famous collector, the Duc de Berry in France, had a 'room of wonders' with items like coconut shell cups and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You don't need to be wealthy to collect. I've collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I once convinced another tulip collector to give me a bulb, only for it to be stolen later. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. This collection was lost in a house fire, and I was deeply saddened. The way collections change hands intrigues me. A silver spoon once owned by a king or poet gains value in the market. As small items become popular, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable investments, especially if you kept the original boxes.

This involves planning, designing, and promoting them. I research the exhibition topic and consult with experts to define the main themes and goals. I decide which objects and pictures to display. It's important that visitors understand the exhibition, so I plan interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also coordinate with engineers and electricians to ensure safety. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to advertise it. Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents for students to learn the routes needed for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are figuring out the best routes, considering one-way streets and turns. I step in when there's a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. As they near the test, I challenge them by suggesting road closures, making them find alternative routes. This encourages them to think critically. Sarah - Marine Conservationist I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone inquiries, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. I sometimes visit the main office but mostly work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the seas. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better, which often changes their perspectives. I love my job because conservation is my passion, but working for a charity means constantly needing more funds, limiting what I can achieve. Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher My job is diverse. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain stock of about 300 books. We uphold high standards of information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is the excessive administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design.'"
FCE_10,"Text: 'No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, the four of us spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have expanded it, but they've done it very discreetly. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement back when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't a success because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, though my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school, as Dekko Deacon sounds quite good. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his surname, like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds were before moving from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive, as she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she instructed the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of details like that; her husband handles redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel like more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but didn't stay up too late because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man on his own and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window, we could see some of them strolling on the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years, this kind of pattern had developed. Since we first came here, we'd all fallen in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.'"
FCE_67,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and preparing delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, called chalets, typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live at the chalet. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest has finished breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest day of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disoriented and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. '"
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl who seemed much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be about six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and large, unattractive shoes, with a bush of wiry hair around her pretty face. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to request a visit to his factory, and sometimes he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed particularly serious, by giving a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how Marie's father made gloves. They were especially interested in Marie's favorite spot, the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were dangerously hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'How many? Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She continued taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' He appreciated her interest in every detail. 'They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you need to visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. It's said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; he's the one you should talk to. Start him on gloves, and he'll talk for two days. That's typical: glovemen love the trade and everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being manufactured, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She had made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where she was dark, but otherwise, Rita Cohen reminded him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that filled the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned in class. How she remembered everything. Everything neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. 'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to take you through the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,"Text: 'Is it really a dream job? Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem. A. Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small issue - she dislikes flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,' she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so cramped with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. Her tasks include organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with a pop group's manager led to an offer to work behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy, especially since golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. Caddies earn a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings. Average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, much of which goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, who made him a statistical data administrator. He compiles and analyzes statistics from cards brought in by caddies, which are used by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try dishes at top restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave.' His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, then a creative director at an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still cooks at home and tries to keep fit by cycling a few miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mainly wrote verse. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing out the morning's notes - all with one finger on an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that's the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were large piles of soft sawdust, like golden mountains, reaching down to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs dangling over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael dared them to jump down. Without thinking, he pushed himself off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, urging them to follow. Hesitant and pale, they looked down, but one by one, they jumped and stood up, smiling with relief. In the hot sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Eventually, one friend suggested they jump again. Though not very eager, they all climbed back up and jumped off, determined, until only Michael was left. The others, now below, called up to him, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them but stayed on the roof's edge, nervously licking his lips and grinning awkwardly. It seemed a longer drop than before. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and taking deep breaths, but nothing worked. The others grew impatient, laughing and shouting, ""Come on, you're a coward. Are we going to wait all night?"" When he didn't move, they began to leave, still calling out. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he shouted. But he stayed on the roof, staring at the ground, feeling alone. As the sun set, a big orange ball in the sky, he was drenched in nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, and fell heavily onto the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was silent; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump earlier. Slowly, he got up and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother spoke to him coldly, ""You're old enough to be home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a touch of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled sternness, but Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, barely listened. He was still thinking of the grinning faces and the laughter from earlier."
FCE_44,"Text: 'Careers Advice Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change jobs are turning to careers advisers. You'll need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help identify your strengths and suggest possible careers and any retraining needed. I decided to try Career Analysts, a large career advice organization. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering timed questions. It was important to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. The psychometrics involved tasks like finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the tests, I had a long discussion with an adviser who gave me a report with observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the conclusions, though I was surprised to learn I did poorly in scientific and technical tests. It's probably good that I didn't become a nurse. However, it was reassuring to hear that journalism was a good fit for me. Rethinking your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, after five years as a marketing manager at a large insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to step back and review my career,' says Donna. Some results were surprising. 'I didn't realize I had a talent for design. But I had to consider the cost of retraining against my financial commitments,' she says. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use my existing skills and move into something more suitable than insurance. I'm now a Public Relations officer. I might have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to several friends who are also happy with the service.' Some people feel they wouldn't have made changes without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make life-changing decisions. 'After six years at a major bank, I found my job dull and needed a new challenge. I had no idea what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget what you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.' However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I was at a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary cut or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt a friend could have given similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"Text: 'Fun at the Dentist's? When you enter W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you'll notice bright modern paintings and a stylish blue couch where patients sit for their check-ups. Jerome explains, 'Half of the people only visit the dentist when they're in pain, not for regular check-ups. They're scared.' To change this, he has created a welcoming environment. 'That's why I don't wear a white coat. People link it with pain. I believe dental care should be relaxing, interesting, and even enjoyable.' This is surprising for many who associate dental visits with pain or clinical settings. Jerome adds, 'If people are relaxed and entertained, they forget past negative experiences.' One of his new techniques is using virtual-reality headsets. 'We were the first in Britain to use them, and they're very popular. During the initial check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit. Another important aspect is the pleasant smell in the office, like orange today. Jerome says, 'I want people to feel with all their senses that this isn't a typical dentist's visit. Smell is crucial. The usual dental smell can make people anxious.' I found the scent in the office very pleasant. Although known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. Relaxation techniques are important, but quality treatment is the priority. For instance, he uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels unusual at first, but it's not painful if you're relaxed. Five years ago, Jerome researched dental techniques in the United States. 'I learned that making it easier for the patient makes it easier for the dentist,' he says. He views his patient-focused approach as a step towards less formality in British dentistry. Just then, a patient arrives. Jerome greets him, offers tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice.'"

**Chocolate's Journey to Global Fame**

Chocolate, originally from South America, is now a huge global business. During Easter, people in Britain spend over £230 million on chocolate, with 8% of all chocolate sales happening at this time. Only Christmas sees more chocolate consumption. While large-scale chocolate production started in the 19th century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over 3,000 years ago.

The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a 17th-century misspelling.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was spiced and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish preferred it with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to spread across Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in European capitals, where people gathered to drink chocolate.

Until the 19th century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The chocolate bar era began in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid, edible block. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to add French elegance. However, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, launched as Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising linking it to the healthy English countryside. This helped it compete with French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain is about four bars per week per person. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers, such as turning chocolate bars into ice creams, soft drinks, or desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. Perhaps consider them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83, Peter Cooke has mastered his art. He still wants to try new things like paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the past ten years. ""Tell me if I am boring you,"" he says while showing me his work in his apartment. There's a fine line between being a bore and an enthusiast, but Cooke is definitely the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I've grown fond of them, and to me, they're adorable. I never intended to sell my work commercially. About five years ago, some friends visited and said, 'You must have an exhibition - people should see these. We'll talk to a gallery owner.'""

This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the high prices his pieces fetch—around £2,000 for the ornaments—an empty space above the fireplace seems a small sacrifice for Cooke. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists he has nothing to do with the pricing and is open about it: he claims no one else in the world creates work like his, and as the gallery owner told him, ""Well, you're going to stop one day, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more.""

""I do wish,"" says Cooke, ""that I'd started this earlier, because then I could have created really wonderful things—the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing my best now, I'm more limited physically than when I started."" Still, his work is far from the common shell constructions found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, resulting in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.

Cooke has developed his own method, using materials as he finds them. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker (""If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!""), and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, color gradations, and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.

Cooke's search for beautiful, especially tiny, shells has taken him beyond his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines, among other places where he has searched for treasures to bring home. He insists he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of stripping the world's beaches. ""When I'm collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why shouldn't I collect them?"" If one considers the amount of luggage one man can carry home, the beauty of his work often surpasses that of the natural parts, making his argument quite convincing."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer isn't traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, she's likely studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency informed me. ""Oh, fine,"" I replied, ""no problem."" I had been trying to dismiss the negative stereotypes about models, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to mind. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't show up at all. What if she decided a trip to the hairdresser was more appealing than meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a rush, in a bad mood, and refuse to answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, accompanied by her mother. Kira wore a simple black dress and trainers, not expensive designer clothes. She didn't seem selfish at all; she was just a friendly, tall, and pretty girl. Kira explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother, who looked very young, was a typical mom, clearly proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her sudden fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. Her older sister was the one who suggested she enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira recalls. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When she got the call saying she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.

Kira now finds it challenging to balance her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have gotten used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, a few unkind people at her school make rude comments about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This must be tough for Kira, as there aren't many successful people who are less self-important than she is. But she says, ""They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her she is needed for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a fantastic career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even take their school-leaving exams. As I finish the interview with the girl who seems to have it all, I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the exceptional beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Pursue Gold in Wales**

Terence and Chris Madden have journeyed from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat in search of precious metals. This father-son duo—Terence, an explorer, and Chris, a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After a decade of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced they are just meters away from a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find high levels of gold; we just need to reach the concentrated area.""

Their gold hunt began when Terence read about gold deposits in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. After studying 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they selected the most promising land. Since discovering gold traces in the rocks, they have spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and clearing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. Having spent their savings, they need to find a backer willing to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it seems doubtful, but we have several people we can contact.""

As news of the dig spread through the valleys, the allure of gold captivated both locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are cautiously optimistic. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would attract more visitors if they succeed, but I hope millions don't come to dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in numerous mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside, space is so limited that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean they can't stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water, and then three hours to get back to the surface. If anything happens and they need to get to the top quickly, they can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it goes rapidly to the surface. No one's tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a very pleasant journey.

Rachel didn't know how she would react the first time she climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and she got in with an instructor. He talked her through the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing her to see how she would react to being in such a small place. Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off some scientific equipment there to study the effect of a multi-national program that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves, but she does it so she can continue her research into the ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees. The only time Rachel was frightened was when she first went down with the Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was an immense bang as the shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They stared at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, they couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - they were still alive!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees those chimneys, there is a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. She had studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign timetables, currencies, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too anti-social and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organizing our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport abroad to find out that your baggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and have to wear unsuitable clothes. Although airlines rarely disclose how many bags they lose, it is a reality that frequent travelers will eventually be separated from their luggage. Even the best airlines make mistakes occasionally, and no airline can guarantee that a passenger's checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially when the journey involves one or more plane changes. The system works like this: Airlines require early check-in times to ensure there is enough time for baggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also extended to allow for baggage transfers. Normally, the system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can delay flights, causing the baggage system to fail. There is also the chance of human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label. These issues can be serious at large transfer airports, known as 'hubs', due to the high volume of bags processed. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient transfer airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have their bad days. The risk of lost baggage is higher than average at certain airports. Even the United States faces issues—Miami airport is known for luggage going missing when transatlantic passengers connect to Latin America. You should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If changing planes is unavoidable or makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline throughout. Allow more connecting time by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"Text: 'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, partly shading the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, mud browns, and the many yellows of sunlight, as gentle as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light and motion so striking you almost feel it. It disappears in a split second, but the image stays in your mind, its impact much larger than its size. Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at a young age. A sign of his deep feeling for this little bird is his inability to explain exactly what draws him to it. After all, it is the stuff of legend. In Greek myth, the kingfisher is a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body took on the blue of the sky, while its underparts were scorched by the sun. There is some scientific truth in that story. Despite the many blues in their feathers, kingfishers have no blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue strongly. This is why a kingfisher can appear to change from bright blue to rich emerald green with just a slight change in the angle of light. It's no wonder that some wildlife photographers are so enthusiastic about them. Combine the colors with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of direct human approach, can be easy to watch from a hideout, and you have a recipe for a lifelong passion. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat only a meter away. But it took another four years, he thinks, before he got his first decent picture. Meanwhile, the European kingfisher began to dominate his life. He spent all the time he could by a stream rich with kingfishers. The problem was, school limited his time with the birds. So he skipped lessons, becoming what he calls an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only one to breed in Europe, was getting noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman. What he'd really like to do now is make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,' he says. 'I'm attracted to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings ...' The sentence trails off. He's thinking of those colors of the bird he's spent more than half his life close to, yet which still excites him. The photographs succeed in communicating some of his feelings. But, as Charlie knows, there's much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can ever show.'"
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**

**A. ANNE MANSON**
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting when she asked to observe Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna and ended up filling in for an absent assistant. This led to more opportunities, including assisting Abbado on several projects. Manson, originally from the US, now works with a London-based opera company focused on modern works and is gaining recognition across Europe, supported by the British Arts Council.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you opportunities. After winning a major competition in 1991, following two unsuccessful attempts, he gained many performance chances and worked as an assistant to a renowned conductor. However, he worries about being permanently labeled as a ""competition winner."" Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting him back, which is crucial for his career's longevity.

**C. WASFI KANI**
Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, enjoys the lengthy rehearsal process of opera productions. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties, supporting herself with a job in London's commercial sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional. Lessons with Sian Edwards were pivotal for her, as Edwards was similar in stature, unlike her previous teachers. Kani appreciates the complexity of opera, including managing singers' personalities.

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly fascinating. Initially a resident musician at an opera house, he gained experience with skilled conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's ""Agrippina"" from the piano at a festival, which was easier than anticipated. Vignoles feels his broad musical experience benefits him and is open to exploring various conducting opportunities to discover his preferences.

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**
Wayne Marshall's conducting career began in 1986 when Simon Rattle noticed him and recommended him to an agent. Marshall, now 32, quickly found himself conducting a musical in London, facing challenges like musicians reading newspapers during performances. He handled it by being firm and clear. Despite not having formal conducting training, Marshall is confident, determined, and knows what he wants, which has earned him respect."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park, Britain offers many options. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not compare. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park caters well to younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There’s a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay. Our only complaint is that the park lacks atmosphere, and the scenery could be better. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and security-conscious.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, with its small replicas of famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the resting areas. The landscaping is perfect, and the staff are friendly. There’s something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, especially the trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you’ll get soaked, but you don’t. Toy Land is great for younger children. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but were too small, which was a relief for us! The park is well-designed, so even queuing isn’t too boring. It’s very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, a staff member offered to accompany one of my daughters when I couldn’t sit with both.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**

We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides aren’t too scary. I’m usually afraid, but I enjoyed myself. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then becomes exciting. We queued for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn’t try the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those brave enough. If the children were older, they might have found it tame, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**

The park advertises 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe’s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is the most terrifying ride according to Ben, although Jennie found the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children rode several times. Sarah was too small for some, but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff attitudes varied; some were great with younger children, but not all were welcoming. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared to leave early."
FCE_60,"Text: 'Running a business in the countryside Five women share their experiences of starting a business in rural areas. A. 'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly turnover of over £200,000 and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were young, and I wanted a job I could do from home. I had experience with computers before marriage, so my husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. But I was careful, always informing the bank manager if I might overspend. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evenings if needed. It remains a small business, and local clients usually pick up their work.' B. 'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, a greetings card designer working from home. 'I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But after marrying, we moved to the countryside, where such jobs weren't available. So, I started my own business, creating 50 different greetings cards that I sell to museums. I work in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is the constant chores, like mowing the lawn. My business grows through word of mouth—I don't advertise. People send work from London because I'm cheaper than other artists. Working alone means I miss exchanging ideas with others, but overall, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.' C. 'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, who runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. 'I started my business eight years ago. Back then, this type of business was growing, and my turnover increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to let them go due to the economic downturn, which was tough because jobs are scarce here. I'm almost back to where I started, making curtains at home with my husband's help and using women who work from their homes. I have to be ready to lower my prices when needed and explore new opportunities.' D. TESSA STRICKLAND manages the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons: financial, as London was too expensive, and because I love the countryside. I enjoy working whenever I want. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I take calls at odd hours. The downside is needing discipline to close the office door. I publish children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. All my professional experience was in London, so I initially felt very isolated.' E. MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly turnover of £250,000, employing six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I'm very interested in health, so I began making fruit cakes with high-quality flour and eggs. Then friends and relatives started requesting them, and soon I was sending cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where everything is made—we have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I no longer bake, as I handle the business side. My biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as we didn't have a lot of money to start with.'"
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is unique in the music world. Not only are the sons, Paul and Huw, talented composers and musicians, but their father, John, also makes musical instruments. When Paul was ten, his parents, John and Hetty, wanted to buy him a cello to match his growing skills. However, they found the cost too high. John, a schoolteacher in South Wales, decided to try making one himself. He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and attended evening classes for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello for Paul. Paul used this cello until recently, as John improved his skills and made another one for him.

John eventually retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling a violin to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo was a highlight for him. Both Paul and Huw were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano but soon switched to the cello, inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Although his parents wanted him to play the violin, Paul preferred the cello. Huw, on the other hand, chose the piano and composition, finding inspiration in Paul's success.

Paul's talent with the cello, made by his father, led him to win the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held until last year. He now plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. John acknowledges that while his cello is excellent, it lacks the projection power of the 304-year-old Rugeri, which will improve with age.

Paul will soon perform Elgar's Cello Concerto on television with the Rugeri, but he won't be able to watch it as he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw will also be busy, with his String Quartet premiering in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will need to be both diplomatic and energetic to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"Text: 'Caring for the Countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden employed by the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it owns. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense. 'You also need to be good with people because you're always dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building firms.' Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the position of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience got him the job, even though he didn't have formal training. 'It's helpful that I still farm with my parents and can relate to farmers and understand their problems. Also, they can't fool me about anything!' he says. His farming background also helps him handle the physical work of the job - putting up fences, planting trees, building walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. 'When I was young,' he remembers, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests. I recently thought, where would I find all those flowers, birds' nests, and grasshoppers now? It's clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just following government advice.' Gareth says that when he started, farmers and conservationists were against each other. Both wanted things done their way. Now they are talking and understanding each other's views. 'We're at a crossroads and just need a small step to bring them together,' says Gareth. Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with public access to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to ensure jobs are completed with minimal fuss and cost. What I enjoy most is seeing projects finished, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills, and so on.' Gareth is passionate about his job and, despite never being off duty, he enjoys every minute of it, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just come into the area, demand everything, then leave as if it's their right. Having to be nice to those people is annoying!' But as Gareth says, it's all about common sense. So if you have plenty of that and like the idea of an outdoor job, you might consider applying to become a warden like Gareth - but don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for many years!'"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met with England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is preparing for the upcoming World Championships. Her days are busy: she teaches at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park. When asked if people stare, she says she's too focused on her training to notice much, though she might see cars slowing down.

Kendra is dedicated to being in top shape for the Championships. This will be her fourth time competing, and it's set to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. She feels the support from the home crowd will be special and hopes it will boost netball's reputation in England. However, this also means more pressure to perform well from the start. Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Although England has always beaten them, Kendra expects an exciting game because Barbados has talented players.

England is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the Championships will be challenging. Unlike a series, there's no rest between games, and there's only one chance to win. Over her 15-year career, netball has become faster and more competitive. Kendra says, ""You train to win, but after the game, we're all friends.""

Netball now uses a scientific approach to fitness. Kendra believes it's crucial to think and train like world-class athletes. As captain, she aims to lead by example and support her team. Her netball career has been carefully planned, and she decided this competition will be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but for now, she's focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might even shed a tear."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should parents handle a child with exceptional musical talent? It's not always obvious how to nurture and support their gift. Some parents might not even notice their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can support academically gifted children, musically talented ones need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is seen as a secondary subject. These children, along with those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

In Britain, there are five specialist music schools, a relatively new concept. These schools offer a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their skills with guidance from professional musicians. Students spend one-third to half of their day on musical activities, such as individual lessons (up to three hours a week on their main and secondary instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is dedicated to a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, though students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, living full-time at the school, which means they spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? The main issue is the cost; boarding fees range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally gifted children with scholarships and financial aid. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize their goal is to develop 'rounded and well-balanced individuals.'

Separating musically gifted children from an early age can be stressful. Early musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a sense of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help and advice if needed. While many former students feel they greatly benefited from the high-quality music education, some question the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, feeling frustrated if their intellectual needs aren't met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide for themselves before considering specialist education. Those who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, such as a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with musical training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers and orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her house is surrounded by a large garden, which provides many of her painting subjects. The garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The garden has a harmonious mix of colors, shapes, and structures, especially in the two long flower borders along the path that runs from east to west. This harmony is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan liked. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden. We got along well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some things I wanted to plant, but when I explained I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants rather than the entire garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they grow, but more often, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set up everything at once,"" she explains. ""I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then I add another, building the painting gradually. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish."" Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. ""They all bloom together, and you're so busy,"" she says. She is also fascinated by the way flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you put them in water, leave them for a day, and they form different shapes. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring in a vase, but they constantly change with twists and turns.""

Susan has always been interested in plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she recalls. ""I wasn't interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked like fake ones sold in some shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs."" Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, which seem as comfortable there as in their native China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed approach to gardening, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects right outside her door, she finds it hard to spend time gardening. She now employs an extra gardener, but despite her need to paint, she believes that to stay connected with her subjects, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isère, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.'"

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. 'Choosing what to wear was difficult because I usually wear a uniform. First, I visited a still-life photo studio, then went to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, and here I was rushing around instead of sitting quietly with an animal. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't usually pressured. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd normally be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.'

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. 'I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a brilliant day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.'

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening programme Ground Force. 'I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Depending on my shifts, I sometimes don't see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My romantic idea of landscape gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I was more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't give up my other job.'

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. 'I made beds and handed out tablets. I thought I might faint doing some jobs, but I was surprised that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is a waste of time compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't exactly pleasant, but it left me with a great sense of satisfaction.'

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with Ryanair as cabin crew. 'I changed into the uniform, and immediately felt different—people suddenly respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.'

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent the day as a personal trainer in a gym. 'I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat ultra-healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier.'"
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Journeys**

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to return as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It offers some of the most stunning sea views. No matter the weather or season, it's always enchanting. From the other window, you can see some of the finest gardens and homes in France, making you feel like you're peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively, a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I've enjoyed many rail journeys over the years, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I owe a lot to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding preparations.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable—we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days to depart if he knew people were still on their way. When it appeared, there was a rush of people climbing into and onto the carriages—some even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite impressions of trains when they are young, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming took place on an old, disused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could. When I returned last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Trying to get published? If you're wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Readers often ask, 'I have written this story/book. Who should I send it to?' The first thing to know is that you should research your markets and learn about publishers while improving your writing skills. Turning words into something sellable requires knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever you write, you need to understand the markets you're targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything relevant. Use your local library and visit bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will guide you on what kinds of writing publishers are accepting at any time. This knowledge must be updated regularly as new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go constantly. Publishers are always looking for new talent; as writers, we must give them what they want. Initially, you might not be sure what you want to write. If you think you might like to write short love stories, first find out which magazines publish them, as it's a limited market, and get recent copies. Familiarize yourself with the stories they buy, noting who the readers are. These readers expect different things from their magazine, and the editor focuses on meeting their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - am I wasting my time? Do I stand a chance?' As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But it's unlikely the work is publishable; I try to give an honest opinion, always positively. Most new writers are too eager to send their work out, often before they're ready. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. That almost never happens. When you hear about 'success', the person usually has years of experience in publishing or journalism. When you send off your work for the first time, start on more work while waiting for a reply; write ten more stories, even twenty. Each one will be better, and you'll start to see yourself as a writer, with growing fluency and confidence. Don't throw any of them away—improve them instead. Also, I advise not showing your work to others, especially early on. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. See if there's a creative writing course nearby. If not, join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing—every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,"Title: 'A Favor at the Station'

On the last day of a difficult year, I was at the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. The station was more crowded than I expected. Usually, it felt airy and clean, but now elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. 

A well-dressed, grey-haired man was moving around, talking to strangers. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her something. Then he came to a girl near me with long blond hair. I had thought about talking to her myself. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

She replied, ""Well, northbound, yes."" 

""But to Philadelphia?"" he insisted. 

""No, New York, but I'll be..."" 

""Thanks, anyway,"" he said, moving on. Now, he had my full attention. 

""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an older lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

When she said, ""Wilmington,"" he moved on to another couple. I straightened up and moved closer, pretending to focus on the train. I was going to Philadelphia, and he could have asked me. But I understood why he didn't; I probably seemed unreliable. He glanced at me briefly and then moved to another bench, looking stressed. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" 

She lowered her book. She seemed about thirty-five, older than me, and looked like a schoolteacher. 

""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Why, yes, I am."" 

""Then could I ask you a favor?"" 

I stopped a few feet away, pretending to check my watch, though I didn't have one. I sensed she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he added, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 

They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, dragging their wheeled bags. I heard the man explaining, ""My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, then went for groceries, and when I got home, my wife was upset. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the Philadelphia station, unsure what to do."" 

The woman clucked sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where this was going. 

""So I told her to stay put. I said I'd find someone here to take her passport."" 

A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? 

""Why don't you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair."" 

This seemed like a weak excuse, in my opinion. It was too much bad luck for one family. I glanced at them. The man held a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one, the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded, so you couldn't feel the contents! And it looked stapled shut. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently."
FCE_30,"Text: 'Gary and Me The restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef. I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very poor condition, but it was perfect for my plans. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother working in a factory and feeling upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife focused on taking care of the children and managed all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This has been very beneficial for our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life. Gary was quite energetic as a child. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven, he tried to jump into it like a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with odd jobs and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had plenty of money at school. He was disciplined. He would wake up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very academic, but he excelled in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He would prepare over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that talent. So when he came to me and said, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for my school course,' I sent him to a friend of mine who owns a restaurant. Gary recently started playing the drums and now he has his own band. Who knows what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary would be: if you try to do too many things at once, you might not succeed in any, so focus on what you know you can achieve. He understood when I told him: 'Gary, if you want to succeed in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.' Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students - usually complete beginners - were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son for you! In the end, he was helping others. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it, because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he was given and seized it. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only remember ten percent of what you've told them, you should be happy with that. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes.'"
FCE_7,"Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was as difficult as finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a flat, that often worked. But for someone like Jo, who had just arrived in Dublin, there were no personal contacts to rely on. She had no one to inform her about a soon-to-be-vacant bedsit. So, she stayed in a hostel and searched for a place. To Jo, Dublin was an unknown territory. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she boarded the train to work there. She never questioned why she was going; it was assumed by everyone at her school that she would leave. Who would want to stay in a small, remote town? That's all she had heard for years. Everyone planned to leave, to experience life, to truly live. Some of her classmates had moved to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle. But none from Jo's year were heading to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, as it was run by nuns and safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying a whole week in a hostel. But Jo was unaware of their thoughts as she responded to an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It offered an 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a queue because it was more 'Third Girl Wanted' than 'Flat to Let.' The mention of 'own television' made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, clearly a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a psychedelic shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Jo noted with amazement that Pauline was a punk. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't spoken to one before. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat.' Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said 'Nessa,' one said 'Pauline,' and the other said 'Other.' 'We'll put your name on it if you stay,' she said generously."
FCE_43,"Text: 'Behind the Dolphin's Smile People love dolphins. We eagerly watch them in marinas, films, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society warns that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds discusses the decline of these species. Dolphins are special to us. They are among the most intelligent animals, sensitive to human emotions, and they inspire dreams of freedom in the wild seas. TV has fueled this affection, with shows like Flipper and Seaquest's Darwin. Yet, these cheerful images hide the harsh reality dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas today. The North Sea harbour porpoise population, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. Despite their popularity, dolphins are not adequately protected by law or marine reserves. This neglect could lead to a major wildlife crisis. There are forty types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two live far out at sea, usually seen in small groups, and we know little about them. The larger bottlenoses and harbour porpoises were once common near European coasts. Bottlenoses, very social, were found along the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only in Scotland's Moray Firth and Wales' Cardigan Bay, and those remaining show signs of stress. Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to pinpoint why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which reduces fish stocks and threatens local fishing industries, also endangers dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are overfished, they may not survive. They also risk getting caught in fishing nets, which they can't see. Modern fishing uses large nets that float or are dragged quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on French and Cornish beaches, showing marks from nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can accumulate in dolphins. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, allowing dolphins to absorb them, which then build up in their bodies. Females produce milk rich in pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Perhaps the most debated threat is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times more efficiently than in air, potentially disturbing dolphins in unknown ways.'"
FCE_51,"Text: 'GETTING FIT Exercise is crucial for your mind, body, and spirit. It's one of the best ways to keep balance in your life, especially when everything around you feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there's a reason it's so often discussed: it's genuinely beneficial. There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to, for most people. Exercise enhances muscle tone and quickly changes body shape. It boosts muscle strength and encourages good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It helps prevent muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries. Exercise also quickly improves specific areas like thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits the heart, lungs, and blood circulation. You might have heard these reasons many times, and perhaps you're bored of them. But here's something to consider: exercise can ease depression and tiredness, regulate sleep patterns, and control stress. It can also help with certain medical conditions. By now, these points should have some impact on you. If not, common sense should tell you that exercise is beneficial. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, or weight training. However, be cautious: training too hard or with too much weight can cause injury, so start slowly and carefully. If unsure, consult your doctor about what's best for you. Good posture is essential for improving body shape. A stiff or sagging body not only looks unattractive but also lacks energy and is prone to minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head upwards. This helps lift your chest for better breathing and makes your body look slimmer. When standing with a balanced chest, you should be able to see your ankles. Stretching improves flexibility and movement, helps maintain correct posture, and prevents muscle injuries. Doing it four or five times a week will ensure a more flexible, fitter body. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, done slowly and precisely. The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period.'"

Among the many creatures in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to unexpected challenges. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive tool so that whenever their vehicle gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him out. Their partnership has produced some of TV's best wildlife films, like their acclaimed film on leopards. Even while this film about Africa's shyest cats was airing, they were back in the wild, this time following the equally elusive jackal. This is common in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been exploring the globe to capture exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman about their partnership during one of his rare visits to a safari lodge. 'We sometimes argue but resolve it quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither sees themselves as the leader, and he believes they get along well because they view animals similarly. 'When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m., we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask.' Their daily diet includes pre-packed meals heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a concern,' says Newman. It can be tough, but being alone in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman recalls filming a lion family where a lioness would greet their car as part of her routine. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on 'The Great Rift', and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I developed a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create films rich in atmosphere, capturing the true spirit of the place and animals, and touching people's hearts. I believe evoking an emotional response is better than appealing only to the intellect.'"
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis interviewed England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra leads England's netball team and is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her routine includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. When asked if she gets odd looks while training there, she replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra is dedicated to being in top form for the Championships. This will be her fourth time competing, and it promises to be the largest event yet, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing at home means more pressure and expectations from the crowd. People expect us to start strong.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Historically, England has always beaten them, but Kendra finds them exciting to play against due to their skill. England is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra acknowledges the challenges of the World Championships. ""You have to push yourself every day, with no rest between games. Unlike a series, there's only one chance to win.""

In her 15 years at the top level, netball has become more intense and aggressive. ""You train hard to win,"" Kendra says. ""But after the final whistle, we're all friendlier."" The sport now uses a more scientific approach to fitness. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" she adds. As captain, Kendra believes in having a strong mental attitude and leading by example, supporting and encouraging her team.

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. While she may coach young players in the future, her focus is on this final event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye, with her loyal supporters cheering her on."
FCE_63,"Text: 'In hot water Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, studying chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When not teaching, she dives three kilometres into the Atlantic Ocean in a small steel vehicle to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can touch the two pilots. We can't stand or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive can last 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.' 'If there's a problem and we need to surface quickly, we can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that shoots to the surface like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be pleasant.' 'I didn't know how I would react the first time I entered the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and I got in with an instructor. He explained emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing my reaction to being in such a small space.' Rachel has now made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. On the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys releasing black smoke. It's where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment there to study the effect of a multi-national program that would drill a 150-metre hole through a volcano.' When not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it to continue my research into the ""black smokers"". This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke, pouring out at one metre per second and at 350 degrees.' 'The only time I was frightened was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when there was an explosion. A huge bang hit our vehicle, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 'Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. Seeing them for real was an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are crucial. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice our clothing, eye contact, body language, speaking speed, volume, tone, and the words we use.

Mary Pearce, who studied to be a teacher, shares her experience: ""I worked hard for my degree and felt confident when I graduated."" She applied for a job at a local primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I could have changed, but I didn't want to be late, as punctuality is important to me."" Mary didn't get the job. A friend at the school told her the Head Teacher commented, ""If someone doesn't present their best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. People think inner qualities matter most, but in an interview, you should present yourself in the best way possible."" Many overlook the importance of a professional image. For instance, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even interviewed. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager and suggested I improve my wardrobe before applying again. I was shocked. I do a good job, and my attire shouldn't matter.""

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our feelings and attitudes are communicated through words, 38% through voice, and 55% through facial expressions. If facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. Ensure your words match your body language to avoid confusing the interviewer.

It's also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, and her interview went so well that she was offered the job immediately. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I showed too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't refuse. As a result, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have negotiated more if I had controlled my excitement.""

Finally, consider what you say and how you say it during an interview. David Artesio, an employment agency manager, suggests researching the company beforehand. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company's activities. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will show your interest in the company.""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London but now runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was made redundant unexpectedly. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a top local hotel. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not in an office anymore, but surprisingly, I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. A career counsellor helped me, though he was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. We married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown, leaving friends behind. Fortunately, our friendships have survived, and many visit us now.""

**The Hatmaker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner with even more hours, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that never happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always something to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss social interaction with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's on me. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989 but resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to owners. To change careers, I needed qualifications, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my destiny."""
FCE_6,"Text: 'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always been into sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. At 14, I had a trial with a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't attract much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped for sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun there with great facilities and nightlife. However, discipline is crucial. If friends invite me out before training, I have to decline. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is key in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics - that would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you often meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so late-night parties are out of the question. I don't mind that much, but I do miss sleeping in. It's worth it, though, as my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I make sure to celebrate, especially if there's prize money involved. The sacrifices pay off because winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters often care more about our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home, hang out with friends, and do normal things. You can't focus on the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've rarely been recognized on the street, which suits me. I get many requests for signed pictures, and I reply to each one. It takes time, but it's worth it. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit overwhelming with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out. It has downsides, though. My last girlfriend didn't like the attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up, I think. It was tough, but sacrifices are part of any sport; you must be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me much now. I'm focused on my game and will catch up on other things after I retire, which happens early in this sport.'"
FCE_33,"Text: 'Young Shoppers Shopping with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder"" because her children want everything they see, from sugary cereals to Disney videos and comics. She feels guilty if she gives in to their demands, but also feels bad for saying no all the time. She tries to avoid taking them shopping but worries they won't learn to make their own choices. Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on TV. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often don't understand why their parents can't buy everything they want, and health arguments about sugar don't compete well with appealing ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says parents care about what their children eat, but their ideas about healthy food aren't always correct. It's important for parents and children to talk about food, as relying only on TV ads gives a biased view. Parents feel frustrated competing with advertisers and having to disappoint their children. The Independent Television Commission bans ads from telling kids to ask their parents to buy things, but the goal of ads is still to persuade. Deciding which requests to accept or refuse is stressful for parents. One mother says her son is critical of ads because they discuss products and labels together, reducing conflict in the supermarket. Parents admit they are inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father, says they refuse sweets for their son while buying treats for themselves. He finds it hard to be consistent, as his decisions depend on his mood. Supermarkets could help by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers.'"
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this luxury hotel. This transformation allowed the installation of the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but for specific preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. For instance, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible due to the guest-history feature that records preferences.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests worldwide. At the Merrion, a high-tech system allows guests to adjust the temperature within a range of three degrees from the standard 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can adjust each room's temperature between 14°C and 25°C. Business travelers, who are expected to make up 65% of the hotel's clientele, will appreciate the technology in the rooms. Each room includes three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. To keep up with rapid technological changes, extra cables have been installed for future upgrades. Televisions are rented, allowing for easy replacement with newer models, and DVD recorders can be updated as needed.

Despite the advanced technology, the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. The 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms are designed to be both comfortable and welcoming. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As with all luxury hotels, excellent food is a must. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, moved his business to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel, as he could design a modern kitchen and enjoy better parking facilities. The hotel gains a popular dining venue without financial risk. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set for success."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share their secrets.

**A. Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:**  
""I think excitement gives me energy. I need to be doing something challenging. Learning new things energizes me. Anything with rhythm, like flamenco dancing, also boosts my energy. Dance is expressive and invigorating. Feeling bored or that life is pointless can drain you. Being effective, even in small ways, gives you energy.""

**B. Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel like a chore. Enjoying what you do keeps you from feeling low, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep to feel great. When I only get six hours, I feel sluggish. Exercise gives me energy, but finding the energy to start is hard! I do yoga once a week and try workout tapes at home. Exercise lifts my spirits. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 PM, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

**C. Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily for energy; it's my natural enthusiasm and positivity. I dislike negative attitudes. I believe in enjoying life and seizing the moment. Enjoyment is key. Achieving goals is important. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. Being around lively young people is energizing. I enjoy a busy life and am very sociable. I like taking photos and writing imaginary song lyrics for fun. It's a good mental release when traveling.""

**D. Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in my work and family life, and being positive helps. I love working with kids; they are resilient and give a lot. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered by interacting with others. Smiling at people and getting a smile back is thrilling. It's better than feeling sorry for yourself. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise plan. My most energetic moments are playing with kids.""

**E. Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:**  
""I love turning wasteland into a garden. I once transformed a concrete area by breaking it up and adding soil. It was better than any workout. Knowing someone wants to read my writing gives me energy; writing in a void is hard. I enjoy sneaking into private land, pretending I didn't know it was private. It's childlike and fun.""

**F. Katherine Monblot, Therapist:**  
""You must respect and be interested in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you dislike drains you. I used to be on committees and resented the time they took. You have limited energy, so focus it on what's most important to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. Your body position is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees flexed to center your body weight, leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is essential in skating, more so than in other sports. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot while making a small movement with the other foot. It seems simple, right? As you practice, you can gradually increase the length of your movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should acquire. Even top professionals fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when falling, which reduces the impact. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you feel confident moving on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best approach is to start with figure skating and then learn basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn basic figures and then move on to turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch skilled or professional skaters, you'll notice how relaxed and smooth they are. To achieve this, you should regularly practice exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include those for the legs, back, and shoulders, focusing on the ankles and knees. After a long or intense session, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It enhances heart and lung function and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."
FCE_64,"**Trills and Triumphs**

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very moving. Julia Gregson spoke with three young achievers and their mothers about the joys and challenges they face.

**A. Annika Reeder, 15,** won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She dreams of becoming a physiotherapist and competing in the next Olympics. ""The work is tough right now. There's no time for TV, hanging out with friends, or much else besides gymnastics and school. I try to take each training day as it comes. When I'm extremely tired, my coach might give me a day off, but usually, I just keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you'll get stiff.""

**B. Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. I've seen parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People often say we've sacrificed a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me. Now, she's met people worldwide and gained confidence from her success.""

**C. Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun. Even without my parents, I'd do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they're happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

**D. Sarah's mother** recalls, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, she was hooked. At 5, she'd get up before us to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, you have to compete all over England. To save money, we sleep in our horse box's living quarters. Sarah is well-organized and completely happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is unbeatable.""

**E. Jane McShane, 10,** is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around and don't think too hard. I'm not worried about getting a big head; I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like feeling embarrassed.""

**F. Jane's mother** shares, ""Jane played her first game at 5. My father said, 'Let's see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. Of course, I'm pleased when she wins, but if she wanted to quit tomorrow, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to put her down for being exceptional. If she has this gift, let her reach her potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by another centimetre. Each year, more truly tall people are born. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're creating a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our ancient size. We're losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic results. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men added occasional animal kills (a lifestyle still followed by the world's few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes). One study found they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with serious consequences. Most of the planet's green areas have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has had a negative effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being a blessing of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. Nevertheless, agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a positive trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have increased, but the world has not adapted. A standard bed-length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have decreased, while clothes manufacturers are constantly revising their product ranges. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it this century. However, scientists add one note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.'"
FCE_57,"Text: 'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this. Like technical difficulties, studio audiences are a common part of television, yet they remain a mystery to many. Watching them get excited on game shows, we often wonder - who are these people? Among all live entertainment audiences, studio audiences are often seen as the least prestigious. I've heard that even people in the TV industry look down on them, treating them, as one cameraman said, 'like cattle'. I used to think studio audiences were just people eager for a brief moment of fame. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all walks of life. TV shows try to attract different people for different programs. Those of us who prefer watching TV at home can't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why apply for tickets, travel far, and endure hours of boredom in an uncomfortable studio to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people hope to appear on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for the chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious about what happens behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was simply, 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it's like. You sit there, crowded among strangers, while someone holds up signs saying APPLAUD or LAUGH - and you clap or laugh as instructed. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager says, 'We always hope a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' But is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte enjoyed feeling involved with live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. Watching him on TV at home, you miss a lot.' What I missed was seeing live actors - from my seat, I could only see the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were filmed so far away that I ended up watching on a studio monitor. Going to a studio might be a bad way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment.'"

**Bruce**  
I prefer landscapes that have a human touch. When I travel, I am drawn to charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. At eight, I went to school in England and would cycle to the village of Lastingham on Saturdays. Cycling was my escape from school. I enjoyed exploring the bleak hilltops, sheltered valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt both familiar and different, and I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a private diary, which was my first step into travel writing, a field where I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a miniature railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by enthusiasts. I always travel first class as it’s only slightly more expensive. The scenery isn’t spectacular; the train crosses Romney Marsh with its sheep and runs alongside a canal. However, I always look forward to the part where the train passes through back gardens. For a few moments, we glimpse people in their daily routines, like making tea or unfolding a deckchair. I see myself through their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, peering into their homes. It’s the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me, just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This simplicity makes me look closer, searching for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and rocky, so there are few crowds. Some brave surfers visit, but most people come to admire the sea's majesty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through beautiful, damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are few residents and visitors. It’s an unknown, empty, and remote corner, and I love the feeling of space. I discovered it by chance as a student and have visited annually since, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It saddens me that he’s growing up in an urban environment.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find pure peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon at twelve. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you’d never return. That place was Glenthorne. It’s the house of my dreams, a magical, secluded, romantic place where you can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"Title: A Day of Animal Chaos

We are a family that loves animals and often finds ourselves in amusing situations with them. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work, excited about finding a pine snake. She asked if we could keep it, and I agreed, but only for one night. We had a special tank ready for temporary animal guests, giving us time to admire them and learn more from our natural history book.

I arrived home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting for help. I rushed to their room to find Domino, our cat, with Bianca, a white mouse, in his mouth. Domino was running around, trying to escape with his catch, while the kids waved their arms to stop him. In the chaos, I tripped and fell, noticing the snake was escaping from its tank.

The room was a whirlwind of noise and movement, with the cat, mouse, kids, and even the dog all in a frenzy. I managed to turn off the boiling pot in the kitchen and returned to the room. I caught Domino by the tail and rescued the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse survived three more encounters with Domino before dying of old age.

Feeling confident, I turned my attention to the snake. It was not easy to handle, but I eventually calmed it down. I carefully lifted the snake and took it to the garden, hoping it would choose to live in the shed. However, when I released its head, the snake wrapped itself around my shoulders like a shawl, seemingly content to stay with me.

As we stood in the garden, my eldest child, DJ, explained why the snake preferred me: I was warm, unlike the shed. We gently encouraged the snake to move on, and it slowly climbed the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, summed up our feelings: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

Yet, for me, receiving a letter offers a unique joy that no other form of communication can match. There's the thrill of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it's from, and the enjoyment of reading it. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote home once a week, and so did my mother. Occasionally, my father would write, and it was always a delight to receive his long, funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday events involving my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it's the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away, and we stayed in touch through letters. Instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to strengthen them. I found I could often express myself more easily in writing than in speaking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but how much better to have a year's worth of news! It's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out on a wonderful friendship. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even reported it on the front page. I am pleased that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Alpine Rock Art**

Tens of thousands of ancient carvings at one of France's key tourist sites are being destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 rock drawings in Mont Bego, in the French Alps, are being damaged so quickly that they might not last for future generations. This mountain, once a place for prayer and worship, has 4,000-year-old carvings on bare rock. These include images of horned cows, fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit, the carvings are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think the pictures will always be there because they have been for so long. But if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, wearing away the rock. Some even take pieces home as souvenirs. When visitors can't take a clear photo, they rub the drawings to make them clearer. The weather polishes the drawings, and if the sun is shining, visitors rub and scrape them to make them look fresher. Other researchers report that people use sharp sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.

Experts disagree on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a 'no-go' area, allowing access only through guided tours. He warns that without this, the site will be destroyed, and research will suffer. Clottes disagrees, saying, ""Henry de Lumley's idea is too severe. It might be effective, but it will cause protests from locals. The site is a historic monument, and we must do everything to save it.""

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,"" he says. ""Our department believes the best solution is to let people visit, but the area is large, making it hard to prevent damage. I would prefer everyone could see it, but the main issue is money. We don't have enough funds to hire guards. We might need to charge a fee. Government funding seems unlikely.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—tourists can now avoid the long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase. She believes the area should be roped off with guides provided. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there's no money,"" she says. ""That's not acceptable. Money must be found because this is a historic site. If we don't act, we'll lose the drawings for future generations."""

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says parents care about what their children eat, but their ideas about healthy food aren't always correct. It's important for parents and children to talk about products, as relying only on TV ads gives a biased view. Parents feel frustrated competing with advertisers and having to disappoint their children. The Independent Television Commission bans ads from telling kids to ask their parents to buy things, but the goal of ads is still to persuade. Deciding which requests to accept or refuse is stressful for parents. One mother says her son is critical of ads because they discuss products and labels together, reducing conflict in the supermarket. Parents admit they are inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father, says they refuse sweets for their son while buying treats for themselves. He finds it hard to be consistent, as his decisions depend on his mood. Supermarkets could help by removing sweets from checkouts or offering play areas for children. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without their demands could attract more customers.'"
FCE_65,"Text: 'Climbing Walls Once, climbers only went to mountains. Now, challenging climbs can happen anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is silent. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by just two fingers, is French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events share one feature - The Wall. This is possible because of new and fast-developing technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing angles. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, top climbers needed to stay fit. With cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This kept their fingers strong and helped avoid boredom. Soon, many sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges. These early walls followed the example of Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who, in the mid-1960s, built a climbing wall in a corridor at Leeds University. Robinson's idea was to set natural rock in concrete blocks, which could be part of a wall. Many such walls were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had design issues. Walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have overhangs and angled slabs. Another problem was that once built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the same holds. In 1985, a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, created a material shaped like natural cliff features. These could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French manufacturers also tried panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhangs without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers endless new holds.'"
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. And acting is indeed a risky career. There are more actors than there are roles for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, while others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it's a personal decision, and only you can take responsibility for your ambition. There are no easy paths - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after training, you will succeed. It's about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new faces and talent, and there is always the chance of excitement, glamour, and sometimes big rewards. People often ask me to define talent, which everyone seeks. I think it's natural skill plus imagination - the latter being hard to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you're doing. Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain your reasons. In theatre, the key is the moment of connection between the actor and the audience. This connection drives all actors. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might shrug. They know some things about themselves and techniques, but they take nothing for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly, you get an audition, but even if you want the job, you might not get it. So, actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of competing for roles and possible rejection. Nobody likes rejection. Remember, the possibility of rejection is there from the start. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. And, in many ways, it's up to you, because if you don't care enough, no one else will.'"

FCE_28,"Text: 'It's true - we're all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about a centimetre. More and more tall people are being born each year. Interestingly, this doesn't mean we're evolving into a new super race. Instead, we're returning to our original size from the time of the cavemen. We're overcoming the effects of generations of poor diet, which is having a big impact. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. About 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented, which had serious consequences. Most green areas were taken over by farmers, and now just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has negatively affected human health and physique. Over the centuries, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing of the New World, was actually a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. Despite this, agriculture spread because farmed land could support ten times more people than hunter-gathering. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. Heights have increased, but the world hasn't adapted. Standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Leg-room in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothes manufacturers are constantly updating their products. The question is: where will it all end? We can't grow forever. There must be a natural limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller, an adaptation to the cold. (Large, round bodies retain heat better.) As the climate warmed, we became thinner and smaller, even with proper nutrition. As the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even more. In other words, human growth could be offset by global warming.'"

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London but now runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was made redundant unexpectedly. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a top local hotel. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not in an office anymore, but surprisingly, I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now earns a living as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor was surprised when I said, 'I don't want to go back to where I've been,' because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. We married young, and our children didn't need our support. Moving to the north of England was a leap into the unknown, leaving friends behind. But our friendships have survived, and many visit us now.""

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner with even more hours, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but that never happened. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always too much to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss social interactions with colleagues, but I love being responsible for the product.

FCE_5,"Text: 'Onto a winner Two brothers are discovering that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with bushy beards, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the ancient game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and introduced it to his family. Soon, the family was playing the game every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But Grandpa's pichenotte board, made from old wooden food crates, was not forgotten, and they continued to play regularly. Visitors were often fascinated by the game, as it was unknown in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave set up the old pichenotte board and, seeing how worn it was, decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one. Then a friend wanted another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!' When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched it. He found that it likely started in India with a game called 'carroms'. It was adapted into 'squails', played in British pubs, and brought to Canada by British emigrants a century ago. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. Pichenotte, played by two to four people, is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using one hand's middle or index finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole earns 20 points. Three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight small posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts two minutes. Seeing the game's popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and started making boards. Over 450 have been made so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. As Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to withstand lots of use.' They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will one day house a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they're happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will make them successful.'"
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a piece of waste ground, flat and overgrown with brambles. It was considered worthless land for years. However, the careful planning and hard work of one man, with constant support from his wife, transformed it into the masterpiece you see today. During the construction, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat site into the sculptured landscape you see now. Bulldozers and digging machines helped, but it also required a lot of hard labor. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were brought in to create the lawns, flower beds, and rockeries.

Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be carefully chosen to withstand the salt-laden air near the sea and the severe winter gales in this exposed location. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were sourced from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The entire village was the vision of Colin Sims, who individually made over 100 models over nine years since the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from various materials—stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—to endure all kinds of weather. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how different materials would withstand changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself.

You will notice that a constant scale has been maintained, and even the smallest details on the models have been carefully crafted. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique construction techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used here have been applied in other model villages around England and are even taught in some college courses on modeling.

All the model buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses commonly found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, the latter being the most recent addition.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; a slip could mean hours of repair work for us. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these to make the models operate.

At the end of your visit, we welcome any comments you might have. New models are always being planned, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models do not meet the standard of the rest of the village, as we are continually updating and replacing them. We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it."
FCE_69,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers publish photos that invade people's privacy and violate the newspaper editors' code of practice. Although pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. More often, significant harm is done to public figures when their private moments appear on the front page. Yet, very few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization set up to handle such issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do intimate photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos and, since she was in a hotel—a place where, according to the code of practice, 'there is a reasonable expectation of privacy'—she had a valid reason to complain, but she didn't take action. The fact that the PCC did not investigate is scandalous. It should also examine the recent outrageous story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on this and other shameful attacks? Initially, this seems like a good idea. It would likely result in many rulings against newspapers. These would be reported by their competitors and broadcast on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would no longer be financially viable to spend their days hiding behind trees to photograph unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person involved still refused to act, should it proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royalty might expect any story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the role is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor the entire British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there is the embarrassment factor. No matter how seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they want the further embarrassment of an investigation? I suspect most people just want to move on with their lives. Of course, some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story may exist that they have kept from the press, and they realize this could also become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. One British comedian also suffered from the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again victims of a sneaky photographer during a family holiday. His reason was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'fury', claiming it was just a bit of fun, and that, being a film star who made comedies, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

FCE_17,"Confident people: What's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were born that way, but most will tell you it's a skill they've learned. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it.

A. Jenny: When I left school, I was very shy and thought I'd always be that way. At twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I doubted I could handle it, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life.

B. Michaela: Four years ago, my father got ill, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive, thinking that's how confident people acted. I learned that true confidence is believing in yourself. If work gets too demanding, I don't feel guilty about postponing tasks. When faced with challenges, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear causes a lack of confidence, so I often talk to myself to overcome it.

C. Lisa: People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more terrified I am. In TV, looking confident is crucial. Interviewing people taught me that most of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer with friendly people. My mother once told me, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves.' That's worth remembering. You gain confidence by facing fears. I was nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I'd never be that scared again.

D. Barbara: My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but it's something I've built over time. By learning from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am popular in the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You must like yourself for who you are, not what others expect. My company offers training courses that boost self-esteem and encourages setting achievable goals. Seeing tangible achievements helps more than aiming too high and getting nothing.

E. Kim: After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak up in meetings. Eventually, I gained the confidence to express my opinions. In politics, I was nervous about public speaking. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' Writing notes helped, like a comfort blanket. Everyone feels a bit shaky speaking publicly. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"

'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and I have many more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. Each kite was exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them under the shade of the coniferous trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, watching Malaysia's largest kite festival. In the center of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a line of competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites soared into the sky. Over 500 men and boys had registered for the five-day competition. Each entered four designs judged on decoration, stability, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them requires skill. Visit my home, and I'll show you how.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As evening came, he invited me to return the next day to rebuild his kite, but my plans didn't allow it. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur into mountains covered with rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to ferry people across. Nearby, a sign read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' It would have been helpful to know that most of this path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and bamboo huts. I decided to stay, ignoring the thought of insects under my mattress. The night was pitch black, filled with sounds. A waterfall roared, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a stunning view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained heavily. Wind and lightning hit the treetops, and I got soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the large butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car being swept away and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, muddy but safe.

Children will explore 14 surprising paintings and answer questions about them. The quiz sheets are available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**

The Gallery now has a beautiful still life by the Dutch 18th-century painter Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is in light, bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for such paintings to have two dates because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons. This picture was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. Recently, the Gallery acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. These artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.

PET_24,"Text: 'Little Chefs For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"

PET_21,"Text: 'MONEY What is money? The pound, the dollar, or the franc are like units of measurement, such as a gram or a kilometre. The key difference is that you can exchange money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of printed paper that costs very little to produce. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green the farmer would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to facilitate more exchanges. Eventually, different currencies began to merge, leading to the use of national currencies today.'"

We are looking for talented writers who can create engaging stories. The judges, including novelist Mary Littlejohn, TV reporter Michael Brown, and Keep Writing's editor Susan Hitchins, want stories that are interesting and original. Last year, detective stories were popular, but the winner wrote a love story. You can write about anything, but here are some tips: Write about what you know This is important advice for all writers. Last year, most stories were about love, family, and friendship issues. However, you need to make ordinary situations interesting for readers. Write about everyday things in a new and surprising way. Get your facts right If you describe a place or explain how something works, make sure it's accurate. Don't write about things unless you're sure about them.

PET_3,"Text: 'THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history books. Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured his daughter received the best education possible. This was unusual because most women at that time had few opportunities to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. Although we have no copies of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to assist her work. At that time, many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone associated with it was in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.'"

PET_27,"Text: 'Grass Grass is likely the most successful plant in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses, and they are found in every region on Earth. They are the only flowering plants that can survive in the freezing environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All of these animals depend on grass in some way. Grass recovers quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This allows large groups of animals to live together in one area. Once they have eaten all the grass, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.'"
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion. She recently won the Young Achiever of the Year award at the Asian Business Awards. Since childhood, she has been drawing clothes and designing patterns. She never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked, so she started making her own skirts and tops. Her friends admired her clothes and asked her to make some for them. She then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear label. Kal's parents were not upset about her career change and promised to support her, which made her very happy. Her clothes are now sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns over £500,000. Her designs appear in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she has gained public recognition by winning this award. Her business has grown significantly, and she feels very fortunate. ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

PET_49,"Text: 'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses Australia from the warm northern coast through vast desert to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', mainly because it is known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but frequent flooding made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are tourists. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, although the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship around the continent, would save time and money. Completing a transcontinental railway is rare, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners eager to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here for a boat trip up the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.'"
PET_31,"Each year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Due to its northern location, the weather can be extremely cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his first experience on Ben Nevis. It was February, and my first major winter climb. We took a route up the north face to Tower Ridge, which is 600 meters high and probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowl-shaped areas halfway up the mountain. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are essential because the snow can be so hard it feels like ice. Even though some in our group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety gear, including lights for signaling, helmets, and extra clothing. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous as we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always challenging. The path soon became steep, and my legs felt heavy. Being the least strong in the group, I needed to rest more often. The others sometimes paused to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they moved on. I promised myself to train properly before future climbs. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, which would lead us to the top. It's only about a meter and a half wide, with steep drops on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly. After seven hours, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. However, we weren't so lucky, as a mist had descended. On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as challenging as climbing up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we took turns with the map. That first time, I only truly enjoyed the experience once I was safely in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. However, this new school is one of the first in my country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched the whole process. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, although it meant losing some lovely open space. The noise from the machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are much bigger than those in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings and other events. There's also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and large changing rooms that we look forward to using once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you'll notice there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us—the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside—and the sound too. If we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we're in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is the tree on the school roof. The builders put it there because it's a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It's so big that it can be seen from miles away! We took pictures to put on our website.

Even though we're using the school building, some parts are still being added. For example, we're putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We're very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we'll learn much faster here!"

As I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't luxurious, but it had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be away from the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would do. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally emerged—covered in mud but thrilled with what we had accomplished.'"

PET_60,"Text: 'Sharks Sharks are some of the most intimidating creatures in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can detect movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their prey. Although sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are different. For instance, unlike most fish, sharks need to swim constantly to breathe and stay alive, so they rarely sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can stop moving entirely. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to study sharks, as it allows them to learn more about these fascinating animals.'"

At my first ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around me, asking questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they switched to English, so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very kind to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once because I felt lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are very challenging, and I eat a lot to maintain my energy levels. This makes me confident that I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I've settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when I was surprised by how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy.

PET_55,"Text: 'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to see the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people decided that the dark and cold winter could be an advantage. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be interesting to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide. When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and new parts open each week until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date depends on nature, so plans can change. In spring, as it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Winter clothes like warm overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks, and choose larger footwear to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and the equipment you need when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The store's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the store said: 'The police were informed that a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly filled up, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them inside. Another issue was the long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. What surprised me was that many people decided to leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few meters to the store. This completely blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who managed to get into the store, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained the situation. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen, but I'm not willing to wait in line again.'"

In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history by diving 120 metres into the ocean and returning to the surface without assistance. She had gone deeper the previous year but used a balloon to ascend. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the only woman in any sport to surpass a man's world record. A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. Despite reports of serious accidents involving other divers, some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya disagrees, emphasizing that safety and training are crucial. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine remains consistent. She spends two-thirds of her time on land-based training at the gym, with the rest split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, opting for fast walking instead. When she begins practice dives, she usually travels away from home, aiming for fourteen dives over four weeks, with rest days in between to avoid fatigue. When not preparing for an event, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental causes through research projects or films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Known in some countries, she believes people listen to her on environmental issues. Looking ahead, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Having started free-diving at twenty-five, she emphasizes she has no plans to retire from the sport anytime soon.'"

With new ideas and advanced computer programs, cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. By the late 1970s, the cinema industry thought cartoons were only for children. But soon after, a few directors had some original ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed because it was too scary for children and too childish for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started making a lot of money again.'"

I took a year off to travel before university. While in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to try for the role. She was surprised but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part.

PET_30,"HONEY

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees, containing water and sugars. Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and flavor of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder flavor than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweetener because sugar was very rare. It was highly valued by the ancient Egyptians, who even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed worldwide. Research suggests that honey can help prevent tiredness and improve athletic performance. Besides being a food, honey is also used for sore throats and in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of England's largest towns. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself independently.

Today, Norwich is relatively small compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was England's second city. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as weeks in the year and as many pubs as days in the year. Although there are fewer churches and pubs now, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich in 1964. With a growing student population and success as a commercial center, Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries,' known for their green and yellow colors, though the origin of the name is unclear.

A modern shopping center, 'The Castle Mall,' is one of the city's attractions. For over two years, residents lived with a large hole in the city center as builders excavated the main car park. Nearly a million tons of earth were moved to create a city center park on the Mall's roof, featuring water pools and trees. The local people are pleased that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas thrive, showing that Norwich successfully blends the old with the new."
PET_43,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a desert city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day annual event. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about a dozen hot-air balloons launching from a car park in the city center. Since then, the festival has grown significantly. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the world's countries are expected at its current location outside the city.

What to See

The pilots communicate via radio and light up their balloons' burners simultaneously. These events, called 'balloon glows,' are perfect for taking stunning photos. To see these 'glows,' you must arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, consider taking a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Alternatively, you can take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest such ride in the world, for a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are many other attractions for all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

The Albuquerque Box

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains shield the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control their balloons' direction by ascending or descending.

Practical Advice

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival entrance. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be quite cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you're not using a digital camera, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night photos."

Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to teach children aged three and four, but she often makes exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's students have group lessons, with about twelve pupils in each group, and each lesson lasts an hour, once every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents must also attend the classes, as it is important for them to be actively involved in the lessons. From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not attempt to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a noticeable difference between their playing and their music reading skills. Margaret explains that her method is not intended to produce great violinists, and she often advises students who excel to leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."

Tom Wilcott is now on bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. From the first song, which is a dance tune, it's clear the band is moving away from slow songs. The second track is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later tracks are in the band's usual slow style. These two tracks will surprise many fans, but they could easily become hit singles because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows his talent by hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems, which led to the band canceling their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets need not worry as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates they can create perfect music in various styles, from the slow ones we know to those that will keep you dancing. However, I felt they put their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band.'"

If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't think about enjoying a run while chatting and smiling in beautiful places, like by a river. Initially, they could only run for a minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned about diet and fitness from other runners.

PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people moved there, hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly established, including one called Iditarod, meaning 'far, distant place'. By 1909, Iditarod had grown so fast that it briefly became Alaska's largest city. During summer, essential supplies could reach these towns by boat, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, blocking access. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This route became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to cross Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' for rest and food for both drivers and dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main transport method.

However, in 1925, dog teams had one last moment of fame when a diphtheria outbreak struck Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, across Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold conditions. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot skilled enough for the flight, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail, and took twenty teams just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers, relying on his dog Togo to navigate through the blinding snow. Togo proved to be a dependable guide. The final part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, an experienced dog team driver in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto, who at one point refused to move further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held annually from Anchorage to Nome, retracing the route of the 1925 journey. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights offers tours in a full-size passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica, and back. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**

The flight lasts about 12 hours. After around four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning. During the flight, experts who have lived at research stations in Antarctica give talks on the environment and history and answer questions. A camera near the pilot, connected to the onboard video system, provides a pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, passengers switch to the seat on their second pass. Business and first-class passengers have a window seat for half the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window or next-to-window seat for half the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. Over Antarctica, passengers are encouraged to move around the plane to share the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over points of interest so both sides of the plane can see well.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the satellite cloud images and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them in detail. We do not land in Antarctica, mainly for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Absolutely! All cameras are welcome. We also offer some fun onboard photo opportunities where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"Text: 'Little Chefs For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are for learning serious cooking. These weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora, who is twelve, is having trouble with onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Text: 'Winter Driving Winter driving is dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly as you go over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. A car coming towards you might unexpectedly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, whenever you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to be aware of what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, triple on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London with plans to study law but chose to attend art school instead. He found traditional drawing classes challenging but continued to paint. In his late twenties, he received a grant from the Italian government to study art, which sparked his interest in early Italian artists. This influence is visible in some of his work. Aitchison admired the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the clear light there, which he wanted to capture in his paintings. To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, though he admits he never knows exactly how the final piece will look. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound simple. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he never makes sketches before starting a painting, as he believes that if he did, he might lose interest and not complete the painting. Instead, Aitchison often changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he prefers models who don't ask to see their portraits while he's working. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London, he has not felt connected to the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition but just paints in his own way. However, his work still influences young British painters."

'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued, 'and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Since drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our home with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,"Atlantic College

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a top private school in Wales. This college is unique because it offers students valuable life experiences outside the classroom, along with their academic studies. The students, aged 16 to 18, come from all over the world. They spend their mornings studying and their afternoons doing meaningful activities, like helping on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the remarkable aspects of Atlantic College is its diverse student body, with students from various social backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are PS20,000 for two years, many students rely on grants. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them attend thanks to government support.

""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you don't get along with. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides its students with an excellent education through effective methods."

I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, even though I was earning a decent salary, I was bored with a job that required little thought. I felt increasingly trapped in the job and envied the students at the local university. They seemed happy, carefree, and hopeful, and I wanted to be part of that. However, now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. Still, I am grateful for this chance to study because I know a qualification is necessary for a fulfilling job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out partying. There are also typical student perks like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I often wonder what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage has been a wise decision.'"
PET_48,"Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he didn't enjoy farming. At fifteen, he started working as a mechanic, and in 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet light steel, he created affordable cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', priced at $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars daily. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant limited options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

She sold each jar for £1 to her friends and quickly doubled the £500.

However, Esther continued with her jam-making. After a few months, she began selling it at the local market.

KET_46,"Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler run the farm, where they keep cows and chickens, selling milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She owns 50 sheep, and each one produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the sheep to prevent them from overheating. 

Five years ago, Jenny decided to make sweaters from the wool and sell them at country markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people weren't interested in buying sweaters. So, she switched to making socks. These socks became popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This marked the beginning of Jenny's business. Initially, she made the socks at home, but as her customer base grew to thousands, she had to send the wool to a factory, where machines now produce the socks.

Jenny's socks come in six colors, five sizes for all ages, and are designed for different activities like walking, sports, and skiing. The busiest time for Jenny is Christmas, as Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In Jenny's office, the walls are covered with letters from satisfied customers worldwide."

Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by over 30% compared to last year. He mentioned that 67% of these burglaries happen when people leave without closing a door or window. He added that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually home then. However, he noted that winter afternoons are ideal for burglars because it is dark, making it easier for them to go unnoticed. Additionally, many houses are empty during this time as people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to watch over other houses on the street when people are away and to contact the police if they notice anything unusual. 'We can also advise you on how to secure your home,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This assistance is free of charge.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before agriculture, people foraged in forests for edible plants and fruits. This lifestyle required constant movement in search of food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people began cultivating crops. These early farmers were pioneers of agriculture. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, leading to the gradual expansion of their villages. As a result, some villagers could engage in other activities, such as making clothes, because farmers provided food for the community. However, farming was challenging during adverse weather conditions, leading to food shortages. Today, agricultural advancements enable farmers to produce more food, which can be transported over long distances to reach our homes.'"

A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos at birth, after being inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and can live up to 50 years.'"
KET_4,"Text: 'THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE Today, policemen are everywhere, but in 1700, London had none. A few elderly men guarded the streets at night, earning little money. Around 300 years ago, London began to grow. The city was dirty, and many people were poor. There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people preferred to stay at home. In 1750, Henry Fielding started paying a group to catch thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown much larger and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was established with 3000 officers. Most worked on foot, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all London police were men. Today, London police are well paid, and those who still ride horses earn even more.'"

KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, thousands of people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to experience the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is filled with actors and artists from around the world. They come for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are vibrant with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even watch artists painting on the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues like halls and cafes. Tens of thousands of tourists attend the Festival to see new films and plays and listen to music by famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these performances are quite affordable, and it's often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding accommodation can be challenging, so consider booking your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and thousands of Canadian fishermen visit each weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they fish for the fish swimming under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,"" he says. ""First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then, you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet some nice people here!"""

Hi Anna,

I'm not having a great week! Yesterday, my team played a volleyball match, but we lost. The other team was much better than us. Then, my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called with bad news. He can't visit us during the holidays because he has a summer job. So, we can't go camping together now. This morning, my sister woke up late and took my bike to school without telling me. I'm really upset with her. I hope you have some good news! Please write back today if you can.

KET_11,"Text: 'Madame Tussaud's A very famous tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Visitors can see wax figures of well-known people there. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures of people and opened a museum for them in Paris. Marie assisted him with his work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was imprisoned. While in prison, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous deceased people, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802 she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures are still on display today.'"
KET_14,"Text: 'BICYCLES Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created around 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were costly, so only wealthy individuals could afford them. These early bicycles looked quite different from the ones we see today. As bicycles became more affordable, many people started buying them. People began using bicycles for commuting and leisure. Nowadays, cars are used more often than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still prefer cycling to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making parking difficult.'"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14 Last summer, I visited Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we went to a park near our hotel. It had lovely flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of big white cards. Each elephant received a paintbrush and began painting on its card. Occasionally, the keepers gave them new brushes with fresh paint and took the old ones away. Gradually, following their keepers' guidance, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I was amazed! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the smartest of these animals live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"Text: 'Big Cats There are many different types of big cats, each varying in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest of the big cats, reaching up to 3.7 meters in length from head to tail. Unlike most cats, tigers enjoy water and often cool off in pools when it's hot. Lions are unique among big cats because they live in large family groups called prides. In these groups, several lions may work together to hunt for food. Lions typically inhabit flat, open areas where they have a clear view to track other animals. All big cats require excellent eyesight to hunt smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and very strong.'"

Although ostriches have wings like all birds, they cannot fly. Instead, they use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches are very fast runners, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the size of chickens and take around 3 years to mature into adults. They eat plants and can survive for many days without water.'"
KET_40,"Victoria Jamieson, a British snowboarder, began snowboarding at the age of 20. Now 23, she has won numerous competitions in the sport. We interviewed her last week during a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked why she took up snowboarding. She said, ""I've always enjoyed various sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural progression. It's quick to learn, and you can become quite skilled in just a few months."" 

When asked about her practice routine, she explained, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because it's so beautiful. But free-riding, which is snowboarding outside of competitions, is my favorite thing in the world.""

We also inquired about what is important when learning to snowboard. She advised, ""You can learn quickly, but lessons are necessary. It's also crucial to have the right clothing to stay dry, as beginners spend a lot of time falling!"""

KET_64,"Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. People of all ages have climbed it, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different routes to reach the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest and takes about five days to complete. It is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers manage to reach the top. This is often due to sudden weather changes. At the start, it can be hot and wet, but at the summit, there is ice and snow, and temperatures can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothing."

Otters are excellent swimmers and can move through water at speeds over 10 kilometres per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, otters were rare in Great Britain. The rivers were polluted, causing many fish and insects to die, leaving otters with little to eat. Today, the rivers are clean again, providing plenty of food for otters.'"

KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the top runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she aims to compete in the 10,000 meters—and possibly the 5,000 meters—at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always maintained a cheerful attitude, which endeared her to the people in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of the year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, was also a runner in his youth but had to stop competing due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a bit and sometimes trains with Gail, although it's challenging for him when she overtakes him. Gail trains diligently, doing a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon, but she always takes Sundays off from running. ""I am with her all the time,"" says Mike. ""Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually about cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""

Every day, he writes in his office and in the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' Bill says. His ten grandchildren, who don't live nearby, also read his stories and give their opinions. This feedback helps Bill understand what young children enjoy reading. Bill writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, The Sheepdog, which is about a farmer and his helpful dog. 'I have always liked animals,' Bill says, 'and dogs are so clever, they learn very quickly.' Last year, the book was turned into a film using real animals and actors.

Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived.
