CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Life**
Theodore Zeldin talks about how work can change. Do you feel respected at work? Having a good job is not enough. Many people feel their jobs are not valued. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Before, loving your job was special. Now, you must ask what your job does to you. Does it make you happy? Does it help you grow? If your job makes you boring or too busy, money and status are not enough.
Zeldin wants work to help people grow. Work should not just make money. It should help people find new talents and meet new people. This change will not stop unemployment. People want jobs that are fun and useful. Work should be like art, with happy people at the center.
Many jobs are not as good as before. Doctors are stressed. Accountants worry about ethics. Architects cannot be creative. Managers are unhappy. Companies are getting smaller. New ideas like more skills and rewards do not make workers happy. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company.
Zeldin studies jobs to see how they affect people. He looks at happiness, love, and respect. He wants to find better ways to work. Many experts help companies make more money, but we also need to think about what makes us happy at work. Are we happy at work, or are we just working because we have to?
Hotel workers are an example. Many smart people work in hotels for low pay and long hours. Hotels have not changed much since the past. They are places where people from different countries meet, but they do not talk. Hotel staff are often from other countries and want to learn, but they do not connect with guests. Hotels could be places where people meet and learn from each other. But accountants say hotels should focus on making money.
Zeldin thinks work is about relationships. People want to be independent at work. They should help design their jobs and choose who they work with. They need to talk to people from different jobs. Good communication is important. Real conversation is more than just talking. It helps people understand each other and can change the world a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: A Simple History**
Broadcasting means sending out information to many people. A long time ago, it meant planting seeds by hand. Now, it means sending words and pictures to many homes.
**How Broadcasting Started**
Broadcasting started as a way to send information from one place to many homes. It was like the telephone, but for everyone to hear and see. In the 1930s, people in Britain tried to make TV like a phone, where you could talk back. But big companies wanted to sell TVs to homes, so they stopped these experiments.
**TV in Public Places**
In the 1930s, people watched TV in public places, like theaters. This happened in the USA, Britain, and Germany. But soon, TVs were made for homes, and people started watching at home.
**Why Broadcasting Grew**
Broadcasting grew because it helped governments share important news with everyone. It also helped people feel connected, even if they lived far apart. As people got more money, they bought TVs for their homes.
**Broadcasting and Society**
Broadcasting helped people join modern life. It made it easier for people to learn about politics, culture, and society. Today, broadcasting is changing, but it still helps people connect and learn."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like having many things does not make you feel safe. It is normal to want a home that has what you need. But sometimes, wanting more things can become too much. Advertisements tell us we need more things to be happy. They are everywhere: on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, and the internet. They make us want to buy more and more.
**Caves**
People around the world study caves. They want to know how caves are made and what lives in them. Caves are interesting and make us curious. Many people study caves, both professionals and people who like to explore caves for fun. Studying caves can be hard because you need to move well to get inside them.
**Weather Watch**
A long time ago, people watched the weather with just their eyes. Now, we use satellites and computers to know the weather. Computers help us understand the weather quickly. But people are still important for making weather forecasts. They use their experience to help understand the weather better."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
I used to think opera was mostly theatre. But now, I know music is more important in opera. I come from theatre, where words and actors are important. In music, many people don't know much about it, but they admire the performers. Watching music is like watching sports; we see how hard the performers work.
In theatre, people don't always see how skilled actors are. They think they could do it too. But theatre and music audiences can be the same people. In theatre, performers and audiences are more equal.
Music can learn from theatre. Music performances are full of emotion and can surprise us. But sometimes, music feels too formal. People are trying to make music more open and fun for everyone. I remember a special opera that moved around a town. It was amazing and involved the audience.
I want music to take more risks like theatre. Sometimes, music can be in new places, which can be exciting. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
I do not like sand. Sand is on the beach. It gets in your food and on your clothes. When you are wet, sand sticks to you. It is hard to remove. But when you get in a car or on a towel, sand falls off. Sand stays with you for a long time. I do not want sand.
**Lock and Key**
People want safe homes. Long ago, people used a beam to lock doors. Now, we use electronic locks. Some locks use smart cards. But people like keys. Keys make people feel safe. One company made a lock with both a key and an electronic system.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous to visit the Tate Modern gallery. I do not understand modern art. I like some art, like furry things and big photos. Art should talk to you. The new gallery helps people understand art. It has labels that explain the art. This helps me understand better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Movies and Books**
**Making Movies from Books**
When we make a movie from a book, we often have to cut out parts. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help us see what is important. In a book, we often read about a character's traits many times. This helps us remember them. In movies, we don't need this as much because we can see the characters.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch a movie, we feel like we are in a different world. We forget about real life for a while. But when the movie ends, we come back to the real world. Some people think movies are just for fun and not real art. They like movies but do not think they are important.
**Movie Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around. There were three main doors, but only one took you where you wanted to go. People who worked there knew their way, but visitors found it confusing. The studio made movies that helped people escape from their problems for a few hours.
**Becoming a Film-maker**
Many people want to make movies. There are books and classes to help them learn. Some people, like Robert Rodriguez, made movies with little money and became famous. In the past, film-makers learned by working in studios. They took time to become good directors. Now, people often have to make movies on their own."
CPE_3,C2,"'A long time ago, there were many small houses on the west side of the city. In summer, a factory nearby made the air smell bad. In the morning, a paperboy would walk and wrinkle his nose because of the smell. I don't remember much from when I was little. But I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses. I also remember my mother. She was small and often angry. I didn't know why she was angry. She liked to be alone, even with many people around. She wanted everything to be very clean and proper. She had friends like Mrs. Buddery, who liked the Royal Family, and Mrs. Winall, who didn't talk much. Growing up was the same for everyone. Before age five, you stayed at home. After five, you went to school. My mother didn't take me to school; I went with other kids. I remember summer holidays and meeting a man who told stories about the sea. My mother didn't like people asking for money. She didn't trust politicians. But she cared about my learning. Sometimes, we went to the museum. She liked looking at paintings. Once, she joked about a painting of a soldier.'"
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue. It was getting dark, and the air was wet. I knew this street well. My neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, lived here. Han Kieffer had a grocery store, and my friends lived in the Kring's and Pottses' houses. I used to play here when I was a child. The street went downhill, and the houses changed. Some houses became stores, and some stores became houses.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that was once a curtain warehouse. It has big doors and brick walls. He did not want one big open space. He used a plastic wall to make a hallway and hide his office. The kitchen is in the middle. He has both modern and old furniture.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer. He liked to travel and write about it. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" was very special. He mixed real stories with his imagination. He believed travel could show us new and exciting things.
**Swimming**
One summer, it rained a lot. I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles in the water. I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea. Swimming lets us see the world in a new way. It is like exploring places that are still wild and mysterious."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying had no clear purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for people. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and babies bond. Many think children cry because they feel helpless. But why do adults cry? It is not easy to explain. The sound of crying is less important than seeing someone cry. Crying might have helped early humans trust each other. We can cry for other reasons too. We might cry when we feel sorry for someone. We can also cry when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially with other people. Crying seems to help us connect with others, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,C2,"'The Earth is Getting Warmer
We all know about global warming. But how much warmer will the Earth get? How will it change our lives? Global warming means the Earth is getting hotter. This can change the weather everywhere. It can also change plants, animals, water, and soil. We use these things to grow food and build cities. Changes to these things are important.
In the last 100 years, people have put more gases in the air. These gases make the Earth warmer. Scientists think this is because of pollution. They use computers to study the weather. These computers help us know what might happen in the future. They say the Earth might get 1C to 3.5C warmer by the year 2100. The sea might rise by 15-95 cm. There might be more heatwaves, floods, and droughts.
Changes in weather can change where plants and animals live. It can also change how much food we can grow and how much water we have. Some changes might be good. For example, in Australia, warmer weather has helped grow more wheat. But many changes might be bad. Less water can be a problem, especially in dry places. The sea level might rise, causing floods. Many people live near the sea, so this is a big problem. Some small islands might disappear. This would be very hard for the people living there.'"
CPE_66,C2,"'Trip to Mars Wanted: a married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. They must be strong and healthy. This is the plan of Dennis Tito, a rich man. He wants to send a spaceship on 5 January 2018. The spaceship will go 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. This is important because the next chance to go to Mars is in 2031. New technology is needed for this trip. If the spaceship is ready, it might go. Even if it does not go, the work will help future trips.'"
CPE_44,C2,"'ART AND LIFE Art is important. We see art in paintings, books, and buildings. But sometimes, we forget that art is also about our feelings and experiences. Art is not just a thing we look at. It is something we feel and enjoy in our lives. Some art is very famous and old. People admire it a lot. But this can make it hard to see art in new ways. When art becomes famous, it can feel separate from our everyday life. But art is part of life, like mountains are part of the earth. To understand art, we need to look at our everyday experiences. We enjoy things like movies, music, and comics. These are also art. They make us happy and are part of our daily life. Art is not just in museums. It is everywhere around us. We should see art in the simple things we enjoy every day.'"
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Lions are big cats. People think lions hunt together like a team. They hide and then catch their food. Lions live in groups. They help each other. But, sometimes, lions do not work together. We started watching lions in 1978. We wanted to know why lions hunt and live together. Lions can live for 18 years. We are still learning about them.
**Pop Music Review**
Bedrock is a music band. They made a new album called ""New Life."" This album changed rock music. The music is fun and happy. It mixes different sounds. The songs talk about life and feelings. The album has 16 songs. All the songs are very good.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I liked stories about wise women called ""The Sibyl."" My mother told me a story about a woman who sold books to a king. I learned a lesson from this story. I was often alone as a child. My mother told me to do fun things so other kids would want to join me. It worked. Later, I wrote a travel book. I like to learn about old places.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you send your book to a publisher, it goes in a big pile. A young worker or an older person reads it first. If they like it, they show it to a senior editor. The editor decides if the book is good and if it will sell. They also want to know if you can help promote the book."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising in the 1990s**
In the early 1990s, people working in advertising had a hard time. The economy was bad, and many people lost their jobs. In Britain, in 1991, the economy went down, interest rates were high, and many people spent less money. Many homes were taken back by banks. Businesses like car and building companies lost a lot of money.
Advertising people felt a lot of pressure. They had to do more work with less money. Companies wanted to make sure they sold things people wanted, not just what was easy to make. This made marketing more important, but also harder.
In the 1980s, advertising was very successful. But in the 1990s, it was difficult. Companies wanted to know if their advertising was worth the money. They wanted better ideas and better work from advertising agencies.
The recession made it hard to make good ads. People didn't want to spend a lot on making ads. There were also new challenges, like changes in the population, more power for stores, and new rules for advertising.
Companies wanted to know which ads worked. But it was hard to find help. Many companies were busy dealing with problems and didn't share their secrets. Books about advertising didn't help much either. They often said advertising was always great, which wasn't true."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Kitchen Dream**
When I was at university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not common. Cooking is hard work. Chefs work long hours and do not get much money. But I did not care. I was not happy at university. The work was hard, and I did not like the social life. Being a chef seemed better. It felt serious and honest. I wanted to learn to cook after eating at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I wanted to know how to cook like that. I started reading cookbooks and cooking a lot.
**Learning to Dive**
The swimming teacher was a small, strong man with tattoos. He taught me to dive. First, I sat on the pool's edge and rolled into the water. Then, I stood and dived from the edge. He was strict and always told me to keep my legs straight and look up. One day, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I was scared. I jumped and felt like I was flying. I did not dive well, but I was happy. I felt free like a bird.
**The Traveller**
Some people like comfort. They want a nice bed and running water. But some people like adventure. They climb mountains and sail alone. They eat strange food and live in the unknown. These people are different. They are not like most of us. We like our safe world with microwaves and phones.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who sails. He is afraid of the sea but likes to write about it. He is a good sailor. His boat has a device that tells him where he is. He likes this device but thinks the compass changed how people sail. Before the compass, sailors watched the sea and waves. Now, they look at the compass. Raban thinks this makes the sea less interesting."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer is a time for two fun things: going on holiday and reading books. Books help us feel good about the world. We see our own stories in books, even if they were written a long time ago or far away. Authors write about feelings we all have. They use words we might not find ourselves. This makes us feel connected, even to people from different places or times. Reading and travel help us see new things. When we go to a new place, everything feels fresh. Books do the same. They show us things we didn't notice before, like the color of the sky or a friend's smile.
**Author's Note**
These travel stories were in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made small changes, but not many. Sometimes, I fixed mistakes. In one story about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it didn't. I didn't change the story because I wrote it at that time. Travel is about seeing the world, even if we don't know everything. We learn as we go.
**Ecotourism**
""Ecotourism"" is a word used a lot. It started in the 1980s when people wanted to travel without hurting the environment. Now, it can mean many things, like living with tribes or a short boat trip. The idea was good, but there are no clear rules. This makes it hard for travelers to know what is real ecotourism.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notes from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found them again by luck. They helped me remember my trip. In Transylvania, I stayed in nice houses and didn't write much. I thought I had nothing to say when I wasn't moving. Later, I wrote my book and didn't worry about small mistakes. I let the story be free."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is not just modern. It has a long history. Fashion started to grow in the 1500s and 1600s. As people and technology grew, clothes and their meanings became more complex. Today, it is hard to say what clothes mean. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.
**Writer**
Many people think writers make a lot of money. But most writers have other jobs. Some write in the evenings and work full-time during the day. Others, like me, do different small jobs. I teach, do workshops, and write articles. Sometimes, I use credit cards to help. With help from friends, I finish my books.
**Sudden Fame**
Our small shows were selling out. More security was needed because of many screaming fans. We used secret doors to avoid crowds. On days off, it was hard to go outside without being followed. We became famous very quickly. Fans watched us, and our managers took care of us. I was shy, but fame made me feel confident and confused. I was not ready for this change."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music and Technology**
Technology is changing our lives. Susan Hallam talks about how it changes music in Britain. In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music. They used radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians.
Music is important. It is part of big events and personal activities. Music will be in the 21st century, but it may change. People might still want to learn instruments. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain. Musical skills are important for jobs, especially in media.
Playing music can help people learn other skills. It can improve intelligence and social skills. It helps children focus and behave better. Playing music can teach good habits like practice and being on time.
In the future, music might change. People will listen to different kinds of music. Technology will help people make music. This might mean fewer live shows. More people might want to make music in their communities.
Music teachers need to change how they teach. They should help more people learn instruments. They need to teach different skills and work with many people. Musicians need to inspire and teach all ages. They need skills for community work.
Music is important in our lives. People in music need to show how important it is. They should work together to make sure music is valued."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes people do not like actors. This happens when actors talk too much about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova. When someone asked her what her dance meant, she said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Actors often use big words or talk about gossip. Paul Scofield, an actor, said that acting is only interesting when you do it, not when you talk about it. Each play is new, and actors learn every time. When a play ends, actors feel empty until the next one.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet. He is between being a boy and a man. His acting is simple and strong. He is very good with the words and his body. He is smart and funny. He makes Hamlet both strong and nice. His acting is very good. You can see it in how he moves. Horatio, another character, is also played well. Acting makes us ask: What is acting? What is real behavior? Who makes these characters come alive?
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors listen and think about the words. When it is their turn, they read the words, think about them, and then speak. For example, if the line is ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe and think about a memory. They find a reason to say the line. The director says to have an open mind and trust the process.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre makes you feel important. Going to the theatre is special. The staff should feel this too. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well. The theatre should fit the human voice and body. Old theatres often do this well. They feel like they have history. Plays cannot please everyone. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and exciting."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll music was very popular with young people. It was important because it changed how many people, including older ones, thought about music. This music helped create new rock stars. Paul Simon, a young boy in the US, loved this new music. He listened to it on the radio show ""Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party"" by Alan Freed. Many young people listened to this show. Paul Simon, like John Lennon in England, was excited by the music. He wanted to make his own music.
**Snow Adventure**
I was walking in the snow. There was no path, but I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me. Suddenly, I fell into a hole in the snow. It was about four feet deep. The snow was like a roof over the hole. I climbed out and felt scared. I thought about what to do next. I sat by a tree and decided to stop my plan. I had only walked half a mile in one hour.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books about qualitative research. These books talk about collecting data but not much about analyzing it. Many people do not know how researchers look at their data. We asked some researchers to share how they analyze data. We wanted to understand the process better. This is not easy, so we let them share their work in different ways, like telling personal stories or using formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
My six-year-old son was eating noodles in a funny way. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He saw this on TV. I asked him about dinosaurs, but he didn't remember much. Many people like learning on computers and the internet. But is it good? One father tried a computer program with his son. The father read the words, but the son played with the pictures. The father thought a book might be better. TV is good for fun, but learning is better with teachers or parents. New technology is good, but schools are still important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, many movies were made in Hollywood. People in Los Angeles did not like this at first. But they liked success. Hollywood makes movies that make money. In less than 100 years, Hollywood became famous like New York or Paris. It changed a lot. Before, there were orange trees. Now, it is a busy place. People in Hollywood talk about movies, money, and famous people. Some people work there but live somewhere else. Many people in show-business go to Hollywood.
**Photography**
Photography started in the 1800s. Artists wanted to keep pictures of what they saw. They used light, lenses, and chemicals to make photos. Photos were more real and detailed than paintings. Some artists did not like this. They said photos were not art. But photographers knew they found a new way to show the world. They used cameras like artists use brushes to show nature and people.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, children's books always had pictures. Even books for older kids had pictures. Many children's books were made, but with low budgets. Some art was not very good, but some was great. Old book pictures are interesting to look at. Some are very good and will be shown again in new books or exhibitions. Some publishers might make new books with old pictures."
CPE_68,C2,"'Blogging: Sharing with the World
A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. It said that when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are telling everyone, even people you don't know. This made people think that sharing too much online can be bad. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. We might think we can become rich or famous. So, we share our stories and photos online. But sometimes, we find out that it can be dangerous and confusing.
In the past, some people started sharing their lives online. They were the first bloggers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and became famous before social media was popular. These bloggers learned many lessons. One of them was Justin Hall. In 1994, he started sharing his life online. He was a student and wanted to share his story. He wrote about everything, and many people read his blog. But one day, he had to stop because it made people not trust him.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, wrote about her job. Someone at her work saw her blog and told her bosses. She lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But Heather's story ended well. She got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a famous ""mommy blogger"" and makes money from her writing.
The lesson is: we can say anything online, but we should be careful about what we share.'"
CPE_23,C2,"'Do You Sleep Enough? Many people today feel tired. In busy countries, people often do not sleep well. In the USA, 40 million people have sleep problems. In Britain, some books talk about people who cannot sleep. People are interested in sleep. They want to know how much sleep they need. One sleep expert says, 'People need more sleep. They wake up early to go to work.' A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep. In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects people. They pay students to help with the research. Dr. Louise Reyner works there. She says some people worry because they use machines to study sleep. But they only look at physical things. They have a car simulator to test tired drivers. People drive in the afternoon after little sleep. They try not to fall asleep. Dr. Reyner says coffee can help. Two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. She also suggests energy drinks and tablets. Scientists know some things about sleep. People sleep in cycles. There are four stages of sleep. Dreams happen in light sleep. The brain stops the body from moving during dreams. Scientists think sleep helps the body and brain, but they are not sure. They know women sleep more than men, and older people need less sleep. In the past, people slept differently. In Britain, from 1500 to 1850, people had 'first sleep' and 'morning sleep'. They woke up in the night for an hour. They used this time to think or do things. As time passed, people started sleeping like we do now. In some places, people still sleep in short times. They wake up and go back to sleep. In some tribal societies, people cannot sleep all night because of noise and danger. Many people around the world need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"'I am wearing big cowboy boots. Very big boots. I stood in my expensive cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I wore a cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and knew I was not at home. I flew from Denver in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy from the sky. But at the Phoenix airport, I saw a real cowboy. He wore a dirty shirt and needed a shave. He looked at my new boots and walked away. I used to be a racing driver. I loved driving racing cars. But I don't do it anymore. I can't. I thought, what do I do now? I tried to be a commentator for races, but many others wanted that job too. I tried to sell classic cars, but nobody was buying. Being an 'ex' racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about 'almost' winning. I miss driving fast cars. I miss the excitement and the people. Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked at the sky. There were no big birds, but small birds in a cactus were singing. I realized I have a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
Many people from different countries live in Vancouver, Canada. In the evening, people walk on the streets. You can hear many languages. People like Vancouver because it has nice weather, beautiful nature, and good schools and jobs. New buildings are everywhere, and tourism is growing. Vancouver is a gateway to other places.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists do not write many letters. Some say it is because they do not get paid for letters. Journalists want their writing to have a big effect. Real artists write with feeling. Shakespeare wrote famous lines without thinking too much about the effect.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, a new supermarket opening in Britain was special. Famous people would come to open it. Now, many supermarkets open, and anyone can open them. Last week, people waited to enter a new supermarket. The first five men got aftershave, and the first five women got flowers. People at the front were happy, and people at the back were not."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
Citizen Kane is a famous movie. It came out in 1941. At first, it was not popular. People did not go to see it. Later, TV made it famous. Many people who make movies love Citizen Kane. It was the first movie by Orson Welles. He did not know the rules, so he did what he wanted. He had a great team. Gregg Toland was the cameraman. Herman J. Mankiewicz wrote the story. Linwood Dunn did special effects. The movie is about a newspaper boss. He is a little like William Randolph Hearst. Welles was happy to make this movie. He was the director and actor.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was strange that morning. He said he might be late. He might go to the golf club. Carmel nodded but seemed not to listen. Dermot asked, ""Will you be okay? What will you do today?"" Carmel said she would walk and look at shops. She said it felt lazy. Dermot said, ""Have fun. If I'm late, I won't need dinner."" Carmel said, ""That's fine.""
**Job Titles**
Job titles can be funny. A study says job titles make people jealous at work. Many workers want a better job title more than a pay raise. People do not like to be called helpers. They want titles like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator."" These titles sound better but mean the same thing."

CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art in London**
The Hayward Gallery in London has a new exhibition. It is about kinetic art, which is art that moves. This exhibition shows art from the last 60 years. The art includes paintings, drawings, and films. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied kinetic art for a long time. Visitors can enjoy the art without many explanations.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is a popular artist. Many people like his art because it is easy to understand. Some people like him because he is funny and interesting. Some critics think he is not a great artist. Hockney knows he is not the best, but he believes his art is still important.
**Window-shopping Art Exhibition**
A curator made an art show called ""Window-shopping."" It was in an empty warehouse. The show had different artworks that did not have a common theme. For example, there were knitted cats and a broken video camera. The curator wanted to show that art can be different and still be interesting.
**Art History**
Some people like to look at paintings but do not want to study them. They think studying art can ruin the fun. But knowing more about art can make it more enjoyable. Our likes and dislikes in art can be influenced by society. Understanding art can be both fun and educational."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
A long time ago, people found metals. They liked shiny things. Maybe they found gold in a river. Gold is soft and easy to shape. People wanted it. They also found copper. Copper is good for making tools. People learned how to get copper from rocks. This was important for them.
**St Ives**
We walked with our bags in St Ives. It was very windy and cold. The streets were empty. The houses were closed. We came by train. The weather was bad. I told my friend we would have nice walks and warm evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. We cannot see how people lived. But we can use computers. Computers can make old places and people. We can see how they lived. We can change things like rain or people and watch what happens."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
One day, a big male vervet monkey saw a new male monkey near his group. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the big male might lose his place. The big male had a smart idea. When the new monkey tried to come close, the big male made a loud noise. This noise means ""leopard is near!"" The new monkey got scared and ran back. This happened many times. But then, the big male made a mistake. He made the noise while he was walking calmly. 
**What Cats Catch**
In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: are there still enough birds? The answer is yes. People feed birds in winter, and birds have places to live in gardens. Cats catch many birds, but not too many.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place. They move slowly and make noises. They go to the water and stand there for a long time. Then, they swim slowly, looking tired. They spend the day in the water, eating plants.
**Picasso's Painting**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish in a fishing town. The painting shows a fish table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive. The painting is flat and calm, like underwater. But it also looks like the fish and crab might fight. The painting feels a little scary."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
Photography is a way to take pictures. It started about 150 years ago. People use photography to show many things in life. We can see faraway places and important events through photos. Photos help us understand the world.
Long ago, people made pictures on cave walls. We don't know why they did this. Maybe it was for hunting, magic, or religion. But pictures have always been important to people.
When photography was invented, people thought it showed the truth. The camera works like the human eye. It can take a picture of what we see. This was a big change for art and culture.
Some people thought everyone could understand photos. But photos can mean different things to different people. They are like language. They can be hard to understand if you are from a different culture.
Photos are very common now. We use them to show our family and friends. Since 1839, photography has changed a lot. Photos are now part of history. They tell us about the past and the people who took them.
Photography is not just about taking pictures. It can change how we see the world. It can help us learn and grow. Photos can show us the truth and make us think."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry is not easy. Everyone has their own way. Some people need to feel happy to write a poem. Others write when they are sad. Some people write every day. Others wait for a special idea. All ways are good. The important thing is to listen to your own voice inside. Let it grow and be free.
**The Short Story**
A short story is short. It cannot have too many characters or long parts. Flashbacks are okay if they help the story. Dialogue, or talking between characters, is very useful. It shows different sides of a story quickly. Every word in a short story is important. It must have action and conflict, just like a novel.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you do not know much. You make moves without knowing the end. But with time, you see the whole game. You learn about strategy. In both chess and screenwriting, practice helps you understand better.
**Looking at Writing**
Speaking is natural for humans. Writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons. But writing is different. Writing systems were created by a few old societies. Not all children learn to write easily. Writing is like a tool that we must learn to use. We need to know how writing works and how children learn."
CPE_8,C2,"'I am writing a book, but I am not sure what to call it. It is not a usual story with a clear ending. I write about a man I met sometimes, but I do not know everything about him. I use different names for people in the story so no one knows who they are. The man is not famous, but he might be important one day. My book might help people learn about him. I did not write down our talks, but I remember them well. I changed some words to make the story interesting. I want people to read my book. The people in my story are from another culture. It is hard to know people from other places well. They are shaped by where they live and what they do. I usually write about people from my own country because I understand them better. In this book, I show people as I see them.'"
CPE_4,C2,"**Poetry Readings**
Today, there are many different types of poetry. Some poets like to write poems for books. Other poets like to read their poems to people. This is called a poetry reading. 
Poetry readings happen in many places. Small groups in towns have them in halls or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings.
Some poets write simple poems for these readings. People can understand them quickly. These poets like to perform in front of people. 
Other poets write more complex poems. These poems have deep thoughts and feelings. It is better to read these poems on paper. Sometimes, these poets read their easier poems at readings.
Listening to poets read their work can be fun and helpful. It is good to have the poem text or know the poem before the reading. 
Poetry readings can make people enjoy poetry. They show that poetry is for everyone, not just a few people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians often use spoken stories to learn about the past. But this can be tricky. When someone tells their story, it is not always a clear picture of what happened. The historian and the person telling the story can affect each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The story is shaped by both the historian and the person telling it. Memories can also be mixed with things heard from TV or other people. Sometimes, people remember the past as better than it was or feel sad about things they missed in childhood. Feelings can make a story sound true, but they might come from later events, not the past.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals. One way is to look at how their bodies work, like nerves and muscles. The other way is to watch how animals behave. Some scientists study animals in labs, like rats and pigeons, to see how they learn. Others watch animals in the wild to see their natural behavior. These two groups are now working together more. Even if we know how every part of an animal's body works, we still need to study how they behave. Behavior has its own patterns that we need to understand. Trying to explain a bird building a nest by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
When students start learning about social sciences, they have two tasks. They need to learn the facts and also how to study them. Social sciences are about people and society, but they are more than just common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of social life and uses special methods and ideas. These ideas help scientists understand more than everyday common sense and make each social science different.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. A Roman architect, Vitruvius, said architecture is about order, arrangement, and beauty. He used some Greek words to explain these ideas. Utility, or usefulness, was not the main focus. The origins of classical architecture are complex. Early buildings in Greece and Italy were simple huts. These huts were not artistic but helped shape later architecture. Even if a classical temple looks fancy, it is basically a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,C2,"'Lily and her sister kept her driving a secret from Chen. Lily drove around the area, sometimes making mistakes. Chen found out but was happy. He said, 'You can really drive, Lily? Good job!' Mui thought Chen should be upset, but he was excited. They planned a trip for a Monday next month. Lily practiced driving more. Mui bought a map and got a discount. They drove to see the sea. Lily drove well, and even Mui agreed. Chen clapped for Lily. They parked near the sea. Lily was careful and paid for parking. Chen joked about the van, and the sisters got upset. Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Chen thought about Man Kee's future. He wanted him to have a good education and own restaurants. Chen saw a ship with a telescope. He showed it to Man Kee and said it would take them home one day. Lily and Mui joined them. Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope. When Lily looked, the ship was gone, and she saw seagulls instead.'"
CPE_43,C2,"'THE WELL I read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars in the day. I asked you to help me try this. You watched as I got into the well bucket. I told you to let me down. The bucket was heavy, and you were not strong enough. I fell into the well and hit my head. I saw strange lights. I was scared and angry at you. You asked if I was okay. I stayed quiet. You ran to get help. I climbed out of the well and hid. I saw water drops on the ground from my wet clothes. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was very upset. Father looked into the well. I was scared they would find me. I came out and pretended I found a secret tunnel. I said I swam out of the well. Father did not believe me. He told me not to be silly. Arthur looked at me sadly. I felt bad for lying.'"
CPE_51,C2,"**Moving Day**
Susan is a widow. Her children are grown up. She is leaving her house. The moving van says ""Removers of Distinction."" Fred is the moving man. He is big and careful. His helpers are not so gentle. Susan's house is nice. It has four floors and looks at a small harbour. Susan lived there for many years. Her children grew up there.
When they bought the house, Robert was five. He asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now Robert is an adult. He is helping Susan move. Francesca, Susan's daughter, is also helping. She is careful with the piano. It is a Steinway piano.
Fred says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred says, ""Yes, they cry when everything is in the van. But they are okay at the new place.""
Susan remembers when they moved in. The piano was hard to get inside. It got stuck on the stairs. Peter, Susan's husband, helped. They used a crane to bring the piano in through a window. It cost a lot of money.
Now, Susan is moving out. She is sad but also happy. The movers take the piano out. Susan, Robert, and Francesca laugh. They are happy it is over. They walk down the path together, laughing. Susan only cries tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**
The Internet lets everyone share ideas. You can write about books on websites like Amazon. On Amazon, anyone can say what they think about a book and give it up to five stars. This helps people know if a book is good or not. 
Amazon has many reviews because it is a big online store. But sometimes, people play tricks. Some writers write nice things about their own books using fake names. One writer, Lev Grossman, did this because people said bad things about his book. He wrote good reviews himself until he got caught.
Authors can also write messages about their books on Amazon. But sometimes, people pretend to be famous authors. Amazon checks these messages, especially from famous writers.
When a book called ""We've Got Spirit"" came out, some people in the book were angry. They wrote bad reviews on Amazon, but these reviews disappeared later.
Most people write honest reviews. This helps others decide if they want to buy a book. Writing reviews is a good way for everyone to share their thoughts about books."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art and Artists**
In the past 200 years, people think artists must be different from others. We like art that is new and surprising. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But today, we sometimes say art is too strange. The media often say this, and we agree. We want artists to be special and different. In the past, people asked artists to make art for them. Now, artists work alone, and we get upset if they try to be like everyone else.
**A Painting Question**
Imagine this: An artist picks some words from a book. The words talk about different pictures. The artist asks someone to make a canvas and write the words on it. The words are written in simple black letters. The question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Art**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an art show until June 26th. Artists usually stick to one style, but some change and succeed, like Picasso. Eric Rimmington is trying something new. He used to paint still lifes, but now he paints the London Underground. He made drawings in the 1980s and now has 40 paintings and drawings of the underground world.
**Island Escape**
A person goes to an island with some books. The villagers say only a sick person would go there. The person is alone except for an old woman who cleans the house. The person is not happy or sad. They think about art and how it helps them understand life. Art is a way to see the true meaning of things. It helps artists deal with life's problems."
CPE_63,C2,"'Family Talk'
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school. I had won two prizes: one for Latin and one for doing well in exams. My father talked to my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't good?"" I asked. I knew my father was thinking. He usually talked a lot. ""You will do what you want now,"" he said. ""You have many certificates. I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said. ""Isn't that good?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I didn't know what else to say!""
""And they say you have the right personality. You can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, ""I think you won't want to join the family business now. You will go to Oxford, and then you won't want it.""
I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to try different jobs, but I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't scared of him like Maurice was, but I respected him.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""You won't want to join us,"" my father said. ""It's a pity because you have the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business.
""You could use me as a consultant,"" I suggested. My mother wasn't around to help; she died when I was young. My father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and I took care of him. I loved Maurice.
Because the business was successful, we lived well. We had a big house in London, went to good schools, wore nice clothes, and went to parties and theatres. My father knew many people, and our house was always lively.
""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford,"" my father said. ""Then you can decide. It will give you pocket money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making a decision now. My father controlled us this way.
So it happened. In my last school term and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year. I became a smart student with a little house, a small car, designer clothes, and a special dress for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me. He took me to a village for a meal and a chat. My tutor said I might get a First Class degree in Law. I felt ready and focused.
But my father needed me for one last job. It was important for the family business. ""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on them.""
My father didn't understand. He might think I was betraying him. As he talked, I saw his dedication and energy. He was a sort of genius, and I respected that. My own plans seemed less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello and his wife, Lois, bought a house in Pembroke Square. They thought it was a good idea, but soon realized it was too expensive. Simon had been doing well at work, and Lois got a raise at her job. They wanted a bigger place for their family, with a garden and space for an au pair. They could have found a cheaper house, but Lois wanted a better address. 
To save money, Simon started taking the crowded tube to work. He often thought about his grandfather's house, where his grandmother took care of everything. But times had changed. Lois made it clear that her job was as important as Simon's. They needed both salaries to keep their lifestyle.
One day, Venetia, a colleague, was very angry with Simon. She accused him of knowing about a bribe in a past case and doing nothing. Simon denied it, but Venetia didn't believe him. He felt guilty and worried that his career could be ruined if people found out. He wondered why Venetia was so upset and if she had the right to judge him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought people here would not care about old houses and messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops know me now. The garden next door has beautiful roses. I usually stay inside, but tonight I am watching birds fly. I cleaned the garden a bit, and my hands hurt. My neighbor, Jaz, talks to me from her window. She writes books, and I sometimes read them because I am an English teacher. Jaz asks how her writing is going. I say, ""How's the work going, Jaz?"" She complains about people asking her about her work. Jaz comes to my garden with a drink. She says, ""Cheers,"" and talks about teaching. She asks about my holiday plans. I feel sad about the empty days. I say I am going to Stonebridge and ask Jaz to feed my cats. She agrees. I lie about staying with a friend. Jaz asks about her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans. I like the title. I tell her to write about nice people. Jaz gets upset. I say I keep a journal and write something good every day. Jaz says, ""Get a life, Ann."" I think about my life and remember my old teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who once said, ""I've had my moments."""
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is about feeling connected to the past. We know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about our past helps us understand our future. Heritage is like a bridge from the past to the future. It is part of our culture, like our genes. Sometimes, we may not like everything about our heritage, but it is still ours. Heritage teaches us many things. In the past, we learned from stories. Now, we learn from places and buildings. It is important to keep these places safe to remember our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I wrote a book called ""Waterland"" about a place in England called the Fens. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty. But I found out they are not empty. The Fens are special and different. They are both wild and calm, open and mysterious. I did not visit many places in the Fens, but I imagined them. The Fens are not just a place; they are a feeling.
**Museums**
Museums show us real things from the past. Before, they just put things in cases with long labels. Now, museums try to make displays fun and interesting. They want everyone to see their collections. Museums also lend objects to schools and help elderly people remember. Museums are different from theme parks and books because they have real items. They help us see and feel history.
**Architecture and Environment**
People have always wanted to keep things from the past. Today, towns change quickly, and this affects us. Some people want to keep everything the same, while others think about how towns should be. People who lived through big events like wars want to keep things stable. Planners need to think about this. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in towns show changes in our lives."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone to name a scientist, they might say Albert Einstein. People use his face to sell smart things like computers and books. Many people don't know what Einstein did, but they know he talked about ""relativity."" This is a big idea that is hard to understand. Einstein helped change how we think about science. He looked at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before, people thought space and time were the same for everyone. Einstein said they are different for each person.
**Young Readers**
When we were kids, Lydia and I did not like books that won prizes. We thought they were boring. Our mom did not like this, but our dad gave us money to read these books. He also gave us some good books as gifts. He wrote on them, ""This Book is NOT Literature."" We thought most of these books were for boys, but we did read some good stories and poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm said the start of human language is a big secret. Many people have strange ideas about it. In 1928, Charles Caller said early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when scared. Some people thought these sounds became words like ""malaria"" for ""fever."" Because of these odd ideas, many people did not talk about language origins. But now, it is an important study area. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. People used it to be friendly and for power. Sharing information was not the main reason for language at first."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Reviews are short and often forgotten quickly. They have deadlines and are usually short. When published, they last as long as the newspaper or magazine they are in. People think reviews are not important. Some writers do reviews for extra money or because they can't work on big projects all the time. But writing reviews is a skill. It is hard to write a good review, whether it is short or long. Reviewers need to think about who will read their review. They need to know a lot about many things and write clearly. Many reviewers also write other things, like books. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews when he is not writing novels. He collects his reviews in books. Some people think reviews should not last, but others like to keep them. Kermode, who is a professor, also writes reviews. In English-speaking countries, it is normal for professors to write reviews. This is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It is also good for professors because it helps them communicate clearly. Writing reviews is a secondary job. You can do it well if you also do other work well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. It was dark and quiet inside. Even after three years, he sometimes felt strange when he came home alone. When he first bought the apartment, he was excited to come home. He wondered what the apartment was like when he was not there. It felt like a safe place for him. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment was always waiting for him. Sometimes it was tidy, and sometimes it was messy. Ralph started to see the apartment as part of himself. He wanted it to change, but it stayed the same. Sometimes there were letters by the door or messages on the answering machine. He was glad nothing was broken or stolen. Ralph worked in an office on Holloway Road. He looked forward to being home alone a few nights a week. After work, he felt like himself again on the bus ride home. At work, he wanted to be alone with his things. But when he got home, he felt empty. He thought his job changed him. He read books or listened to music at night, but he wondered why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. He remembered a time when he felt strong. After university, he wanted to make a plan for his life, but he just wanted to survive. He applied for jobs his friends talked about. He followed them, hoping to be happy. He went to one job interview for a local newspaper. He talked to Neil, his boss, and got the job. Neil said Ralph was the only graduate who applied, and Ralph felt good about that."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse. I moved through the crowd to find a good spot. There was a special area for the race. People stood on both sides to watch. Some people tried to keep the goats in order. Goats like to eat many things, so it was not easy.
**Canoe Trip**
The day was ending, and I was scared about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in. We did not see any villages or huts all day. In the moonlight, we could see the cliffs. Our torch was not working well, so we put in new batteries, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. Lesley saw a light, and we were happy. But it was just moonlight on the water. We heard loud water, but we could not see it. We kept moving.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations. But as a managing director, I need to do it for my colleagues and shareholders. How can I get better and feel more confident? You are not alone. Presenting is different from running a company. Many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince others, you must believe in what you say. Show your passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues about hard questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and build to your conclusion."
CPE_64,C2,"""Some things take time. You cannot hurry them. If you rush making mayonnaise, it will not work. If you pull a tangled fishing line, the knot gets tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things we can do fast, like solving puzzles. But some things need time, like thinking deeply. We have three speeds of thinking. The first is very fast. It is like when you react quickly to something, like a motorbike skidding. This is called 'wits'. The second speed is thinking with reason and logic. This is called 'intellect'. It is like solving a problem or doing an assignment. The third speed is slow thinking. It is like daydreaming or being lost in thought. This is important for creativity and wisdom. Sometimes, slow thinking helps us understand complex things better. Scientists are learning more about this slow thinking. It can solve problems that are too hard for fast thinking."""
CPE_29,C2,"**Living in a New Place**
I am in a new place. People are nice to me. There are about 40 people here. They are scientists, students, and other workers. We all help each other. I can speak a little French, but not very well. I cannot talk a lot. I feel shy at meals. I am scared to talk. I smile a lot and feel nervous. I miss talking a lot like I did before.
**Meeting Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was a new writer. He did not notice me. Later, I became a successful writer. Then, Elliot was nicer to me. He invited me to lunch. After that, we saw each other more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
Alfred Hitchcock was a film director. He liked the pictures and sounds in his movies. He did not care much about the story or acting. He wanted everyone to feel the same when watching his movies. He wanted people to be scared at the same time. He was very smart and knew how to make people feel things with his movies."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. 30 years ago, there were not many charts or books. Telescopes were not very good. Now, there are many telescopes and tools. Computers help make charts and share results. This is a good time for amateur astronomy. But, some things are not as good. You may need to travel far to see a clear sky. Airplanes make trails in the sky that can become clouds. This makes it hard to see the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are many new things to buy and do. Technology makes things change fast. This can make people tired and stressed. People want simple things in life. But, it is hard to find simple things when there are so many options. There are too many types of soap and cereal. There are too many software updates and phone plans.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we stay at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother. We do not let anything change this. The people who stay here are like us. They are old-fashioned and polite. I do not like rude shop workers or waiters who act too friendly. I know many guests by name because they have been coming here since they were children. We greet each other politely but do not talk much. It is nice to have privacy and respect."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
There is a play called Othello by Shakespeare. It is now in London. Before, I wrote a bad review about it. I said Ray Fearon, who plays Othello, was too young. But now, I think he is very good. The whole cast is very good. There are many great scenes. One scene is about Cassio and other officers playing games. Another scene is about Iago losing control. A very sad scene is when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The play is very exciting. You should see it.
**Lake Vostok**
In Antarctica, there is a big lake called Lake Vostok. It is under 4 kilometers of ice. The water has been there for 25 million years. Scientists want to study the lake. They want to find out what is in the water. They are planning to explore it soon.
**Scientists**
Scientists are talking about why they do science. They want to know why we want to learn about things like atoms and black holes. Some people think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right. Science is a tool, and we decide how to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Food is important. Cooking is fun and easy. You can make soup with carrots, leek, celery, and herbs. It is better than buying soup. You can make chocolate mousse in five minutes. It is better than buying it. Cooking shows love. We eat together at parties like birthdays and weddings. We do not eat takeaway at weddings.
**In the Elevator**
Alistair's office is messy. Papers are everywhere. He owns an apartment building. He has many books. Mallory is coming to see him. She is always on time. Alistair wonders what she will think of the mess. Mrs. Wilson cleans his apartment. She does not want to clean his office. She thinks Alistair is strange.
**Karen**
Karen wants to be different from her mother. When she was twelve, her brother hit her with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but she was okay. The doctor said she was lucky. Karen felt she had a purpose.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty is a teacher. She is happy and sad. She learned something new. Dr. Bailey is sick. He was her doctor for many years. He was kind and listened to his patients. The village loved him."
CPE_59,C2,"Joanna's Lessons
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She also writes books for children learning the piano. Joanna is very good at playing the piano. She plays many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it for him.
Joanna cares about how children learn the piano. She wrote a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" for young learners. She is very busy with concerts and other projects, but she thinks the first piano lessons are very important. She wants music to be fun and for everyone to enjoy.
When Joanna was young, her mother taught piano to many children. Joanna learned that music is for everyone, not just for those with special talent. She believes everyone should try to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.
Some children learn piano quickly, but others take more time. Joanna is interested in helping all children enjoy music. She thinks some children stop learning because they feel too much pressure to be perfect.
Joanna's books are colorful and fun. They have stories and CDs to help children learn. She wants learning to be fun and encourages children to try different things on the piano. She believes practice is very important. Joanna practices a lot and thinks it is the most important part of her music life. She says it is important to know what you want to do before you practice."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said, ""Easy writing is not fun to read."" Good writing is hard. When I look at my old school essays, I see few mistakes. Now, I would rewrite them many times. Writing by hand was slow, so I was careful. Computers make writing easy, but also sloppy. Many writers spend a lot of time fixing their computer drafts. Emails are not like handwritten letters. They are less emotional. But, many people now write love emails. This is good. But, words on a screen can be boring. People who use computers often write too much. Their words can be unclear. Handwriting has more care and character.
**The CD**
I looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the disc was shiny. Mr. Warriston said, ""CDs are amazing. They hold a lot of music."" He showed me how to play it. ""Some say CDs sound bad, but I like them,"" he said. I asked, ""Do you turn them over like records?"" He said, ""No, you play one side."" He thought about it and said, ""Good question."" He smiled and said, ""Let's find the best place to listen.""
**Books versus Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said if matches came after lighters, we would think they are better. People say electronic text is like the invention of printing. But, changes take time. In 1979, a book said books would disappear in the 1980s. This was wrong. Reading on a screen is not fun, so people don't do it. Computers make people read in small parts. Some say this is a new way to read, but it's not. Many books are not read from start to finish, like religious texts and dictionaries. Computers don't help with reading everything.
**The Office**
Charles walked into a tidy office. The carpet was clean, and the desk was nice. Kathleen was organizing files. She said, ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" Charles liked the room and its old furniture. He didn't want a computer there. They talked about this many times. Kathleen didn't understand why Charles didn't like technology. He was good with computers and wrote a paper about them. Kathleen helped him with that paper. She was very good with computers."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She knew Lancelot did not take sugar because she made him coffee for many months. Lancelot was at work all the time now. He used to meet authors and playwrights for lunch. Now, he was very busy and had no place to park in the morning. ""This came,"" she said, giving him a folder. ""From that man in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Lancelot did not want to see another 'synopsis'. Ian Cuthbert got a lot of money to write this book. Lancelot thought Ian was a talented writer, but Ian did not finish the book. Ian was difficult to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine, but it never came out. Lancelot thought giving Ian the book was a mistake."
CPE_65,C2,"'Breakfast in England
Breakfast is important for health. But, a long time ago in England, breakfast was not common. In old stories, people did not talk about breakfast much. Sometimes, travelers ate early before a long trip, or sick people ate breakfast to feel better. Most people did not eat breakfast, only kings and rich people did.
In the 1500s, breakfast became normal for everyone. Some people say this is because there was more food. But also, work changed. People started working early in the morning for many hours. So, they needed to eat breakfast. Breakfast was not just for rich people anymore.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a person takes a photo, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, ideas, and culture. In this book, we will see how these things change the photo and how people see it. For example, when we look at a photo in a newspaper, we might think about if it shows the real scene or the photographer's idea. Is the moment in the photo important, or does it show something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves. You need to focus if you want to win. Sport is hard, and you have to work for it. Sport teaches me to work hard and be strong, but also to work with others. My sport lets me be good alone, but I also need to be part of a team. Sport is like life - you can do well alone, but remember others are there too. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has shown me new things and places. But you also have to give up some things for these good things.
**Tuning In**
Some memories stay clear in our minds. For me, one special time was in California many years ago. I was awake at night, listening to a bird sing beautifully. I don't have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song kept me awake. The bird's music was like jazz and Indian music. It felt like the bird was making up the music as it sang. I listened and enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always talked about birds. Birds are important to us. Paul Evans writes about this. A small bird, a wren, is hitting the glass of a greenhouse. Is it trying to tell us something? Or is it just stuck? In the past, people thought wrens could bring good or bad luck. Today, we still see wrens in pictures and homes in Britain. Wrens are part of our culture and we like them. A place without wrens feels sad. 
Birds have been important to people for a long time. In the past, people watched birds to know about the weather or find food. Birds were also part of stories and dreams. Our feelings about birds show who we are. We like their flight, song, and freedom. Birds are important for nature. They show us if the environment is healthy. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because we lose not only birds but also part of our culture. 
Some birds, like the skylark and turtle dove, are in poems and stories. They mean love and magic. Losing these birds is sad. But we don't notice the loss of birds not in stories. Stories and legends about birds are important. They help us feel connected to birds. Watching birds is exciting. We can't always explain why we like them. The wren in the greenhouse makes us think about the past and the future. It is a mystery."
CPE_28,C2,"'Maps A map shows where things are on the earth. It helps us see how far things are from each other and which direction to go. Long ago, people used time to say how far something was, like 'a day's walk' or 'a few hours by boat'. This told more about how easy or hard it was to travel than the real distance. People also wanted to know 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. So, written directions were used a lot, like maps. Some maps, like train maps, do not show real directions. Early maps used signs to show important places. These signs were different in each place. To understand old maps, we need to know the signs they used. Making maps got better over time. People used science to help make maps. They used a compass to find direction. They learned the earth is not a perfect circle, which helped make better maps. Maps were not just for travelers. Soldiers needed maps to show land for battles. Other people like archaeologists and geographers also needed special maps. Today, maps show many things like weather and land use. Maps help us understand many things in science. Making maps has changed a lot over time. Sometimes it was slow, and sometimes it was fast. Old maps were often copied, so new ideas took time to be used. Maps show us how people thought in the past. This makes studying old maps interesting and helpful.'"
CPE_35,C2,"'TIM RICE I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber. His room was very nice, with many records and a stereo player. He had nice wine glasses and furniture. Andrew was going to study history at Oxford, but he wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I wanted to be a pop star for money and fame. Andrew played me some of his music, and I thought he was very good. He needed someone to write words for his music. I had written a song before, so we decided to work together. I thought Andrew was very talented and wanted to help him. I was training to be a lawyer, but I liked music more. Andrew had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who helped orphans. I wasn't sure about the idea, but Andrew's music was good. We started working on the musical together. I skipped work to write lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I was changing my career.'"
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
People can talk to each other. Language is very important for humans. It is hard to think about life without talking. When people are together, they talk. If they are alone, they might talk to themselves or to their pets. Talking is natural for people, like making webs is natural for spiders. Spiders do not learn to make webs; they just know how to do it.
**Climate and Weather**
The air around us makes the weather. Weather and climate are important for animals and plants. Warm and wet places have many plants and animals, like jungles. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes because the air moves. The sun makes the air move.
**Coffee**
I worked in a restaurant. I served drinks and made coffee. In Melbourne, coffee is very important. I learned how to make coffee. It was not easy. I learned to make cappuccino. My boss said making coffee takes time and practice."
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why is TV not good at showing art? Painting and sculpture are good for the camera. The camera can show a whole art piece and also the details. But, not many TV shows make art interesting. An example is Robert Hughes's show, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a good critic. He talks about American art. I thought the show would focus on great art. But it was more about American history and culture in art.
**Dealing in Metals**
I worked with metals for 20 years. I was known for taking risks. Metals are not controlled like other markets. With luck and knowledge, you can make money. Risk is normal in this business. But now, more metals are being taken from the earth, and prices are going down. Prices are half of what they were 20 years ago. I was asked to check on a big company using cheap metals.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco is part of the Bahamas. There are 700 islands. Each island is different. To travel in Abaco, you need a boat. If your hotel does not give you a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat. Sailing is very popular. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World.' The waters are good for fishing, diving, and swimming. The beaches are like pearls. At night, the lights of restaurants and cafes shine."
CPE_69,C2,"'Make Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
At the Bamboo Bike Club, you can make your own bike. James Marr and Ian McMillan are engineers who run this club. You get a custom bike frame and a fun weekend of building.
The club is in Hackney Wick, east London. It is the only place in the UK where you can build a bamboo bike. Bamboo is a new trend in bike making. It started in 1894. But bamboo bikes are expensive. They can cost $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes cheaper. They worked in a shed in Wales. They wanted to share the fun of making a bike. So, they started the Bamboo Bike Club. They have jobs too. James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.
The course is not expensive. You learn to pick strong bamboo and make strong joints. You use tools to cut and glue the bamboo. James and Ian help you if you need it. You can choose the look of your bike: plain, black, or mottled bamboo.
On Sunday, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them. This makes the bike strong. Then, you add wheels, brakes, and a seat. The bike is strong and good for long rides. Ian rides his bike to work, and James tested his bike off-road.
Bamboo bikes look different. They are not as neat as metal bikes, but they are unique. They are good for a relaxed ride. The ride is smooth because bamboo reduces vibration. The bike costs less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray. She thought it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione has her own company. His book helps men and women talk to each other. Many people in America like self-help books. These books are very popular. Editors look for books that can sell well. A good title is very important.
**Autobiographies**
An autobiography is a book about a person's life. The writer should tell the truth. But sometimes, they do not. They might feel too embarrassed to share everything. Some writers make up stories to show the truth better. They might call their book an autobiography, but it is not all true. Readers might think it is true, but it is not.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories are about solving crimes. They show problems in society. In Hammett's stories, society is not perfect. The detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is both good and bad. He works with the law but also understands the criminal. This makes his job hard.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. He says writers must know the culture they write about. Science is like its own world. Only scientists can write about it well. Writers should not make things too simple for readers. They can use easy words but must keep the ideas clear. If readers feel they are being talked down to, they will not like the writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in London, it is very cold inside. The gym uses a lot of air-conditioning because it is very hot outside this summer. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic inside the gym. Many places use too much air-conditioning. Instead, they could use other ways to stay cool. For example, they could use natural light and air, and have thick walls to keep the heat out. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun. A long time ago, people used sundials to keep their clocks correct. But then, clocks and watches got better, and sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are interested in sundials again. David Harber makes sundials and says they connect us to the planets. When a sundial starts working, it feels magical. Sundials are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I once saw older women painting china cups with flowers. They were very good at it, and their hands were steady. I wondered who would want to learn china-painting. Would they be good at it too? When I visited a china-painting class, I found it was fun and not scary. The students were there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint quickly like the women I saw before."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price. They would fly from Gatwick Airport and stay in Venice for twelve nights. They would stay at Pensione Concordia. At the travel agency, they learned they would be with a school group learning Italian.
But something went wrong. Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland, not Italy. They stayed at Hotel Edelweiss, Room 212. At Gatwick, a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform checked their tickets. She said everything was fine.
On the plane, they heard people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks. When they arrived, a woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on.""
They thought it was an overnight stop. But the next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist said they could enjoy the lake and take a boat to Interlaken. Keith said there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice.
The receptionist did not know about a mistake. Dawne described the man who booked their trip. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, said there are many holidays with similar tickets. She laughed and said they couldn't end up in a wildlife park.
Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing there. The receptionist was gone. They heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks was kind.
An old man named Nottage talked to Keith. He and his wife slept well because of the lakeside air. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They did not talk about the irony. They wanted to escape the elderly, but their holiday was with elderly people. Uncle had said they needed a break from the elderly."

CAE_15,C1,"'A Special Animal in Madagascar In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue. The aye-aye uses its teeth and long finger. Scientists have studied how the aye-aye finds insects. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied some aye-ayes. He gave them logs with holes. Some holes had food, and some did not. The aye-ayes found the food without seeing or smelling it. They used their middle finger to tap the wood and listened with their big ears. Dr. Erickson thinks they hear echoes to find the insects. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker and a bat because it uses sound to find food. It is also like a squirrel because its teeth grow all the time. The aye-aye can also open nuts with its teeth and finger.'"

Hannah Renier helps people by writing their life stories. She makes a books with at least stories and pictures. These books are about normal people, not famous ones. Hannah started this because she talked to her family and saw that many stories were disappearing. People like to share their stories. They do it for their children and themselves. One man shared his life story. He talked about his divorce and other hard times. He wants his family to learn from his life, but he hasn't let his children read it yet. He thinks they can read it after he is gone. Hannah sees that many people repeat things from their childhood. They marry people their parents like or do the opposite. People still feel sad about things from their past. Hannah listens to their stories and writes them down. She doesn't judge them. People want to be honest. These books are not for everyone to read. They are for family. Each book takes many hours of talking and writing. The books are special and cost a lot of money. Hannah thought more people would want them, but they are expensive. She advertises in magazines for rich people. These people used to have paintings made of them for their family.'"

I have had small children for 35 years. I love being a father. I fed the baby this morning. My children and I like the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. We are close. Now, they are grown up, and I am more like a friend. I do not like hitting. I have hit my children before, but I do not think it is good. I try to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. I do not want them to feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I do not want to do it to my children.

CAE_46,C1,"'Flying Without Gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the young passengers it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135. But inside, it was different. It was a long white tunnel with lights on the walls. Most seats were gone, except a few at the back. The 13 students from Europe and America sat there. They had worked hard for 12 months to be on this flight. The European Space Agency asked students to think of experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight. The plane flew up and down like a roller-coaster. At the top of each curve, the plane and everything inside became weightless for a few seconds. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than the Earth. The plane took off smoothly, but soon it climbed steeply. The engines were loud, and we felt strange. Then the engines stopped, and we floated. For 20 seconds, we moved in silence. Up and down no longer had meaning. After ten seconds, gravity returned, and some students fell. There were 30 curves in total, giving ten minutes for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. A German team looked at metal joins in space. Students from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films. After two hours, we felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. 'It was unforgettable,' said one student.

Jonathon went to New Zealand every year. He liked winter, so he went there in the New Zealand winter. His parents bought land in New Zealand. It was 20 miles north of Auckland, in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was okay for trees. 
Jonathon and his brother and sister planted trees there. They started in 1968 and finished in 1972. It rained a lot when they planted the trees. Jonathon worked with a man who knew how to plant trees. 
They used a bag to carry the trees. They had to plant the trees in straight lines. Jonathon liked the hard work. He thought a lot about life while planting.

I looked inside and saw three small badger babies. They were grey, with black-and-white heads. They were cold and crying. Builders found them after their mother died. I took them to the kitchen to warm them. There were two girls, Primrose and Bluebell, and one boy, Willow. I fed them with a syringe and wiped them with a warm cloth. This helped them go to the bathroom. After a few days, they drank from a bottle. They were happy and warm. But Willow got sick and died. He had a lung infection. I was sad but kept caring for the others. A farmer brought another boy badger. We called him Willow II. He was hard to feed but got better. By five months, they ate cereals, meat, and vegetables. Badgers usually eat worms and bugs. In August, they became active at night. We walked in the orchard. They played and chased each other. We built a home for them on the farm. It had tunnels and rooms. They moved in and were happy. Now, they live in their new home. I see Bluebell and Willow II sometimes. They say hello and then run off. This is their home now."
CAE_67,C1,"'Finding True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet Dr. Toby Clark works at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass changes. Anjana Ahuja writes about it. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for Halley's Comet. But he also studied compass changes, called 'declination'. Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this to use their compasses correctly. Without it, they could not find their way on the ocean. Halley was one of two men paid to do science. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination. The trip stopped early because of problems with the crew. But Halley tried again. This time, he went to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he made a map showing compass changes in the ocean. This map helped sailors for over 100 years. Dr. Clark wants to celebrate Halley's work. He plans to follow Halley's route on the ship Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 first. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led a big trip in Antarctica, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life. Halley was a great scientist and explorer. He also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book. Dr. Clark's trip will also have scientific value. He will take new measurements with better tools. The Earth's magnetic field changes, so new data is needed. This will help improve the model of Earth's magnetic field. Dr. Clark will use satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the U.S. Navy will give him tools. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his work will fill in any missing data. Halley's trip was the first big science trip on the sea. He was the first civilian naval captain for science. Dr. Clark has the experience for this trip. He worked in Antarctica and sailed from Rio to England. He plans to finish the trip in four parts with different crews. Dr. Clark is very dedicated. He says, 'I will give up my life for eight months to do this. Halley and his life give me a purpose.'"
CAE_27,C1,"'PEACOCKS AT WHIPSNADE PARK Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show their big, colorful tails. The female peacocks, called hens, look at these tails. Long ago, Charles Darwin wondered why peacocks have such big tails. In nature, animals need to be strong and fast to survive. But peacocks have big tails that are not useful for this. Darwin thought maybe female peacocks like beautiful tails. His friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, thought the tails show something good about the peacock, like being healthy. Today, scientists like Marion Petrie study peacocks at Whipsnade. They want to know if hens really choose males with the best tails. They also want to know if these males are better in other ways. The scientists watch the peacocks and take pictures. They see that hens like males with many eye-spots on their tails. But they are not sure if these males are healthier. Another scientist, William Hamilton, thinks showy birds have fewer parasites. Marion Petrie is checking if the children of attractive males are healthier. There is another idea called 'Fisher's Runaway'. It says if a female likes a male with a nice tail, their children will also like nice tails. This can make tails bigger over time. This idea supports Darwin's thought that females choose 'beauty for beauty's sake'.'"
CAE_66,C1,"'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS Tom Cunliffe talks about his boat, 'The Westerman'. He likes boats that mix old and new ideas. In London, there is a big boat show with many new boats. These boats have new technology. Tom's boat is different. It is on a small river in the south. It looks old, but it was made last year. Tom likes old boat designs but uses new ideas too. He thinks new technology can make sailing too easy. He likes some comfort, like a warm stove, but he also likes to work with the sails. Tom thinks a boat should not be like a house. His old boat, Hirta, had no electricity or fridge, but it was easy to sail. When Tom hurt his back, he needed a new boat. He built 'The Westerman'. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew it on paper, then used a computer. The boat is strong and has won races. It looks old but is made with new materials. Tom believes you don't need to follow new trends to be happy with a boat."

On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I did many classes like yoga and stretching. The teachers were very good. I felt better every day. They have many treatments like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff were very nice and professional. Henlow will add a new swimming pool this year. You can also ride bicycles or walk in the garden. I felt happy and full of energy after my stay. I want to go back. Marcella B. SHRUBLAND HALL This place is calm and relaxing. When you arrive, you get a medical check-up. They check your weight and blood pressure. I found out I had a shoulder problem, and they helped me with it. Everyone gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry. A typical menu was grapefruit for breakfast, salad for lunch, and fruit and soup for dinner. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. Liz C. CAREYS MANOR Careys is not a health farm. It is a nice old manor with a gym and pool. The food is very tasty, but not for people who want to lose weight. There is a spa bath, steam room, and sauna. They also have a sports injury clinic. I got help for my shoulder injury. Careys is comfortable and relaxing. Beverly D. CLIVEDEN Cliveden is a big country home and hotel. It has health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a pool, and more. There are nice walks and gardens. The restaurant has very good food. I enjoyed a facial and a massage. Cliveden has many things to do if you want to be active. Kay E. SPRINGS HYDRO Springs Hydro has very good carrot cake. It is delicious but has many calories. The aromatherapy massage is also very good. I slept well after it. The place is modern and has many treatments. There are many guests, like football teams and friends. I would like to visit once a month. Eve'"
CAE_22,C1,"**Natural Talents**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means we are not very different from animals. Many things we thought only humans could do, animals can do too. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with sounds for different animals like 'leopard' or 'snake'.
Art is one thing that seems different between humans and animals. But, humans did not make art for a long time. The first clear human art is from about 35,000 years ago, like cave paintings and statues.
People say human art is special because it is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinct. Human art does not help us survive like animal behaviors do. Birds sing to find a mate, but humans make art for pleasure. Human art styles are learned and change quickly, unlike bird songs which are the same for many years.
Some chimpanzees, like Congo and Betsy, made paintings. They painted for fun, not for a purpose. Their art was shown in a gallery in 1957, and many paintings were sold. This shows that the line between human and animal art is not always clear. Some human art is also made just for personal satisfaction, not to communicate with others."
CAE_39,C1,"**A Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert is in western China. It is a very dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived. 
There are not many big adventures today. In the past, stories had brave explorers. They traveled to unknown places. Now, we do not see many explorers like that. But Charles Blackmore is one.
Blackmore led a team across the Taklamakan Desert. The desert's name means ""once entered you never come out."" Local people call it the Desert of Death. Blackmore talked about the dangers of the trip at his home.
The team had four British people, one American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers were actually truck drivers. This was a mistake that could have been very dangerous.
The team traveled 1,200 kilometers across the desert. Blackmore wrote about their journey. He was leaving the Army after 14 years. He wanted to do something fun and prove something to himself. His wife, Tina, was worried. No one had done this route before.
The trip took 59 days. The team faced many problems: sickness, hot and cold weather, and not enough water. But they found water when they needed it. They did not face sandstorms or very cold weather.
Blackmore was worried about his physical strength. On the first day, the desert was very hot. He was scared but knew they had to start.
Towards the end, the team was tired but strong. Blackmore felt proud of the journey. He thought about his family and how important they are to him.
Blackmore still wants challenges and open spaces. He finds modern life difficult."

CAE_49,C1,"'Why do we sleep? People sleep for about one-third of their lives. Sleep is very important, but we are not sure why. Scientists have three main ideas. The first idea is that sleep helps our body stay healthy. When we sleep, our body fixes itself and gets ready for the next day. The second idea is that sleep helps us learn. When we sleep, our brain remembers what we learned during the day. The third idea is that sleep gives us energy. We sleep to get more energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"'ECCENTRICS An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many people have small, unusual habits. Some like to enter newspaper contests, collect beer mats, or write letters to newspapers. Eccentricity means being unique. Inside us, we have two forces: one wants to be different, and the other wants to fit in. Most people want to fit in because they want to be liked and accepted. People with unusual hobbies or ideas often find others like them. They make clubs and have meetings to share their interests. They feel better in a group. We all feel a pull between being different and fitting in. Sometimes, we want to show we are unique. For example, someone might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as I am."" We can choose to be different and show our personality. Some people become famous by doing this, like Bob Dylan, an American singer. He said, ""When you know what you want and go for it, people might not understand you."" But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. If a singer wears strange clothes to get attention, or a person says shocking things to be noticed, they are not eccentric. But if they keep doing these things until it becomes normal for them, they might be eccentric. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care what others think. They are different from people who want to impress or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives without worrying about what others think.'"
CAE_58,C1,"'Books About Nature We asked four nature experts to tell us about the book that influenced them the most. A Geoffrey Lean It was easy to choose the author. As a journalist, I met many important people in the environment field. Barbara Ward was the most important. She was very involved in environmental issues in Europe after the war. She wrote about her experiences and ideas. As a young journalist, her work helped me understand the environment. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But The Home of Man is her most important book for me. It talks about the growth of cities and important themes like sustainable development. I have read many books since, but none are as good. B Linda Bennett When I read Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I remember the sounds and smells of herring gulls. This book explains how animals communicate. After reading it, watching a gull colony makes sense. You can see which birds are partners and where the boundaries are. Niko Tinbergen wanted to explain his findings to everyone. He worked with artist Eric Ennion to make this book. Ennion's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and another is calm. This is true art from a nature expert. C Lee Durrell My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a great husband and a career in conservation. I read it while researching animal sounds in Madagascar. I was having a hard time, but this book made me happy. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty together. Many say humans are bad for nature, but Gerald saw the world as a family. We need to understand this. D Bruce Pearson I found The Shell Bird Book by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. I loved the 48 color bird paintings by Eric Ennion. I already liked birds and had bird books. This book made me want to draw birds to help identify them. It had chapters on bird migration and birds in music, literature, and art. It showed me that my feelings about nature are as important as scientific facts. I was better at art than math or science, so this book opened a door for me.'"
CAE_37,C1,"'DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five British publishers if reviews help sell books. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are very important for publishers. Many people buy books because of reviews. Authors and publishers feel sad if there are no reviews. Bad reviews can still help sell books because people want to decide for themselves. Publisher B Publishers and newspapers both like book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain readers. Publishers want their books reviewed well. Reviews are better now than 40 years ago. Reviews help people know about books and authors. A good review can help sell books. Publisher C Reviews are very important for us. We publish books by new authors. Good reviews help sell books more than ads. Reviews can help start a book's success, but other things like word-of-mouth and marketing are also important. Publisher D In the US, one review can make a book popular. In Britain, it is different. Sometimes, books with bad reviews sell well. It is hard to predict. Publisher E Publishers and writers want good reviews. But sometimes, if reviews are too detailed, people do not buy the book. The reviewer's name used to matter more. Now, a fun or interesting review can make people want to buy the book.'"

Nicholas Evans is a British writer. He wrote a book called ""The Horse Whisperer."" Before the book was even in stores, it was very popular. Nicholas was a screenwriter and wanted to be a director. But things were not going well for him. A movie he was working on did not happen, and he had no money. He was worried about paying the bank.
Instead of getting a job, Nicholas went to America. He wanted to write his first book. He got the idea for the book from a man he met in Dartmoor. The man told him about a horse that was very wild. A gypsy talked to the horse, and it became calm. People like this gypsy are called ""horse whisperers.""
Nicholas traveled in the US to learn about horses. He was alone and worried about money. He wrote the first part of his book and showed it to a friend. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought he might get $30,000 for it. Nicholas needed more money than that.
In October, he sent the first part of the book to publishers. Soon, his agent told him that someone offered $75,000. But they waited, and the book sold for much more. It was a big success. Many people wanted to make a movie from the book. Nicholas was happy but did not want to write the movie script. He wanted to write another book instead."

This means you can set two wake-up times, one for workdays and one for weekends. This model also has a cassette player, which is nice for the price. You can listen to your own tapes. The radio quality is good, but it is big. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case. This model was the best-looking and the winner. Paul Bridges liked it, but the clock sometimes stopped at 16.00. I liked the digital display. The snooze bar is easy to use. The clock has a backup power, so you don't need to reset it if the power goes out. But it is hard to set up. Tom Granger said the model with a lamp is 'tacky'. The lamp is hard to use. The radio is hard to tune. The buzzer is loud. This model is popular with young people. It has bright colors. Tom Granger and I liked it. It is easy to set up. But the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges did not like this. The simplest model is cheap and small. Tom Granger liked it because it is easy to set up. It has old-fashioned tuning.

CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Do you buy more than you want when you go to a store? Stores use tricks to make you buy more. Here are some tricks:
**A. Fresh Look**
Supermarkets know people like fresh food. They put fruits and vegetables at the front of the store. They might also have a bakery with fresh bread smells. The store might use green colors to look fresh. Most things they sell are in packages, like frozen food.
**B. Product Placement**
Where things are in the store is important. Supermarkets know where people look the most. They put expensive or fast-selling things there. Shelves at eye level are popular. Special offers are in big bins. They put things that go together, like salad dressing near salads.
**C. Staples Spread Out**
Supermarkets put cheap things like bread and tea far from the entrance. You have to pass other things to get them. Stores put popular items far away too, so you see other things on the way.
**D. Less is More**
Some stores show fewer items to look special. Next stores do this. They make clothes look exclusive, even if they are not.
**E. Total Price**
People care about the total bill, not each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some things cheap to get you in the store.
**F. Price Tags**
In chainstores, people notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference.
**G. Lighting**
Stores use special lights. Chainstores want natural light for clothes. Supermarkets use lights to make food look good.
**H. Walking Paths**
Stores use different carpets to guide you. Some stores use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas.
**I. In-Store Ads**
Supermarkets use big pictures of food to tempt you. In the US, some trolleys have screens with ads. They show ads when you pass certain items. This is for people who buy on impulse."

CAE_8,C1,"**A Simple History of the Apple**
**Old Apples**  
People have eaten apples for a very long time. In old times, people in Britain and near lakes in Switzerland and Italy ate small wild apples. These apples were not like the apples we eat today.
**Apples in Britain**  
Around 1000 AD, the French learned to grow apples from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. British monks worked on making new kinds of apples. These apples are the ancestors of many apples we have now.
**Popular Apples**  
In the 1200s, some apples became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a dessert apple. The Costard was a cooking apple. But then, fewer apples were grown because of bad times like droughts and wars. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII asked Richard Harris to learn about apples in France. Harris brought back new apple types and started a big apple orchard in Kent.
**Apples Around the World**  
By the 1700s, apples were very popular in Britain. People took apples to new places like Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. In America, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees.
**New Apples**  
In 1850, a farmer in Iowa found a new apple and called it 'Delicious'. It became very popular. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith found a new green apple. It became known as the 'Granny Smith' apple.
**Today’s Apples**  
Today, apples are grown everywhere. But most apples come from only a few types. People want more different kinds of apples. We need to protect and grow many types of apples for everyone."

Richard has been coming to Kenya for three years to train. But this time, he trains with Kenyan runners. He also runs in a race in Kenya. The race is in Nairobi, and it is the first international race in Africa. Many Kenyan runners finish before Richard in the race. Richard learns that Kenyan runners train very hard. They live and train at a place called St Mark's College. It is high up on Mount Kenya. The runners wake up early and run three times a day. They eat simple food like bread, eggs, and a dish called ugali. Richard thinks the simple life and hard training help Kenyan runners become the best in the world.'"
CAE_7,C1,"'Advertising Problems
Advertising is not doing well. It is not just because of the bad economy. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the economy got worse. The problem is bigger and is happening everywhere. Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now markets are smaller. Ads for big brands should focus on small groups, but they often do not. This is where advertising is wrong.
Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you buy many things. Most are not advertised. You might buy a few advertised brands. In a year, you might buy a few hundred brands. For big items like cars, you buy even less. You do not buy many clothes, and most are not advertised. Even with other things like candy and medicine, you do not buy more than 400 brands a year.
There are 32,500 advertised brands. Let's look at the 9,500 brands that spend a lot on ads. Most people buy only 400 of these brands, not all because of ads. That is about 4 per cent. So, 96 per cent of ads are wasted. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for things you buy. For most people, it is about 1 in 16. The rest are wasted.
People think they do not listen to ads, but they do. Most people do not buy the brands they see in ads. Waste is part of advertising. Not everyone will buy what they see in ads. People only notice a few ads. But advertising can still work. It talks to many people to find the few who will buy. Ads are a cheap way to talk to many people.
Advertisers can try to waste less by targeting better. But they can never know who will buy. Even direct mail does not get everyone to buy. This is different from selling face-to-face. A salesman might sell to everyone he talks to, but ads cannot do this. If advertisers knew who would buy, they would not need ads. They could talk to people directly.
If an ad gets one million new customers, it is doing well. For soap, the top brands would be happy with a million new buyers. Any ad that gets 2 per cent of people to buy is very successful. This is a small part of the population. To reach them, ads need to be more focused.'"

Charles Clover visits a special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This house is very good for the environment. It is called the 'autonomous house' and was made by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle waste to make garden compost. The house stays warm with heat from people and electrical appliances. 
The house looks normal from the outside. It has a clay roof and is near an old church. The house is very quiet inside because it has special windows. You must take off your shoes when you go inside. The house has a special way to let air in and out. Even the cats, Edison and Faraday, have a special door.
Robert and Brenda teach architecture at Nottingham University. They care about the environment. They wrote a book about green houses in the 1970s. They wanted a house that does not harm the environment. They do not use mains water. They collect rainwater and use it carefully. They do not have a dishwasher because they do not want to use strong soaps.
The house does not have water bills. It uses very little electricity. Soon, it will have solar panels to make more electricity. The house has a small wood stove for very cold days. In winter, the house is warm enough without extra heating. 
The house is simple and easy to fix. It was cheap to build. Many builders do not want to make houses like this."
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera and the fairies Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man. But in 1920, he saw photos of fairies in a garden and believed they were real. He published the photos and wrote about fairies as amazing creatures. In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them with flowers. The photos looked nice, but they were not real. This shows that cameras can lie. Today, we can change photos with computers, but even in the past, photos were not always true.'"
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
A long time ago, blacksmiths were very important people. They made weapons, armor, and tools for farming. People thought they were like doctors. Blacksmiths also made beautiful art. They made ironwork for big buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. 
In the 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths in Britain. Big factories did not need them anymore. But now, blacksmiths are becoming popular again. People like nice designs in their homes. Some blacksmiths make things that look old, like Victorian-style gates. 
There is a group called the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). They have an exhibition at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says blacksmiths can now use power tools. This makes their work easier. They can make many things, like bookends and staircases. 
Alan Dawson made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says working with steel is like drawing with metal. Susan May, a jeweler, likes how iron is soft when hot and hard when cold. Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles. She likes how steel feels strong and lasting. 
Iron is a special metal. It can be used to make beautiful things. People will probably use iron for decoration for many years."
CAE_14,C1,"'THE DAY I STOPPED SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my friends was very angry. 'Why didn't you stop years ago?' she asked. I don't know how to explain. One afternoon, I smoked a lot, and four hours later, I stopped. It was strange. I went to a stop-smoking session two months and three weeks ago. It was a mix of group talk and hypnotherapy. I didn't plan to stop smoking. I liked smoking. It made me happy. I went to the session to write an article about people trying to stop. I said, 'I won't try to stop. I'm here to write, not to stop.' The counsellor looked at me. We could smoke as much as we wanted. The room was full of smoke, so we opened the windows. I noticed that when they told us to smoke, I didn't want to, and others didn't want to either. The stop-smoking ideas made sense. The idea of stopping felt good. It was a secret feeling just for me. Could I do it? It was easy in some ways. The need for nicotine went away after a minute or two. It lasted only four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't. The hardest thing was being at home on weekend mornings. Smoking was something to do when I was bored. I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Doing things without smoking is new for me, like eating out or waiting for a plane. These are times I used to smoke.'"

CAE_56,C1,"'Margaret and her special skill Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground with a forked stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a business to drill wells. They use machines, but to find water, Margaret only needs her stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time. This skill is called dowsing. Some people think it is like a 'sixth sense'. There are many ideas about how it works. Some say it is because everything vibrates, and water vibrates more. Dowsers, like Margaret, can feel these vibrations. In recent years, Margaret has been very busy because of dry weather. She helps farmers, people with holiday homes, and golf-course builders. Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and not near waste. The well should also be near electricity to run the pump. Margaret starts by looking at a map with a pendulum. The pendulum swings over places with water. Then, she walks with her stick to find the exact spot. When she is over water, she feels something special. The stick moves up when water is below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If Margaret and her husband do not agree on the spot, they keep looking. Margaret's skill is not common, but it helps her family business. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This skill helps her find water and keep their business successful.'"
CAE_36,C1,"'We changed lives for a day! Have you ever wanted to live someone else's life for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to do something different? We helped four people do this - read their stories. Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant. A. Amanda's story I had never been in a place like it before. It was dark and noisy with many people. It was very different from my home. Being a mother is busy, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but the drinks fell off my tray and crashed on the floor. I was so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. By 11.30 am, people were waiting outside, and I felt nervous. I was worried about remembering orders, but everything was automated. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn't get used to the loud music. I had to say 'Pardon?' a lot, which was embarrassing! By 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to rest my feet. I couldn't believe it when a waitress said it was a 'quiet' day! I never knew waitressing was so tiring. I thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be friendly and calm. I'm shy, and I don't think I could work on a busy Saturday night. I wasn't happy with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me! I was glad to go back to my children. It seems easy after waitressing! B. Cindy's story I was nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was excited too. I was told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. I was wrong! After Amanda left, I had to get the girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have some peace. Wrong! Amanda left a note saying I had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing. At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home, the real trouble started. They jumped on the sofa and screamed loudly! I thought they would get tired, but they didn't. I thought I had energy, but they beat me! After much persuasion, I got them to bed by 8 pm, but then they wanted water and to watch TV. It was tiring to spend all evening making deals with them. I never knew looking after two small children was so tiring. You don't have time for yourself, and the responsibility is big. Even so, I enjoyed the day. Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school. C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I get up at 5.30 am, so sleeping until 7 was nice! I didn't know what to wear. I couldn't wear overalls and boots! Looking at about 400 pupils at assembly, I hoped I didn't stand out. After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, which was different from when I was at school. Then I helped with a nature project. By lunchtime, I was tired and wanted a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There's so much to do before classes start again. I went to a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a reading lesson and then a French lesson. This was fun because the children wanted to practise on me, which showed my rusty French. Finally, we went to the school hall for Physical Education. I was tired, but the children had lots of energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Teachers may get more holidays, but I think I'll stick to farming! D. Hilary's story I arrived at the farm at 8.30 am, only to find Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's farm has 100 cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep! She makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream, which is sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk and making ice-cream. It was hard not to taste the goodies! At lunchtime, it was time to check the sheep. I picked up a sheep that had fallen over. If sheep are left for more than 12 hours, they could die, so they have to be checked every day. After feeding the calves, I started the milking. It took two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, every day! I found it lonely. I missed the children - animals don't talk back! The worst part is not being able to get away from work. The cows always need milking, so it's hard to plan time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems nice, but the reality is different. The income is irregular, and I'd hate to depend on the weather.'"

His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, who was a trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. Bo saw that Hakan had talent.
Hakan became very good at playing the trumpet. He did not want to play in an orchestra. He wanted to be a solo artist. He liked a French trumpet player named Maurice Andre and listened to all his records. Hakan's parents helped him follow his dream. At 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud also thought playing in an orchestra was not for Hakan.

CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Be a Good Leader**
A. What is a good leader? A leader is someone who helps and guides others. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, a writer, says leadership is about 'making things happen with people who are excited like you.' A good leader should speak clearly and with confidence.
B. John van Maurik, a teacher, says, 'Many people can be leaders, but they don't know it.' We all have some leadership inside us. We just need the right time and place to show it. We can see big leaders like Mahatma Gandhi or Richard Branson, but leadership is also important at work.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you had. Both may have been good at planning and meeting goals. But the best boss made you feel good and helped you. The worst boss made you feel small and blamed you when things went wrong.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to follow rules. Leaders make new paths. A good manager keeps things running. A good leader can change a team or company for the better.
E. You can be a better leader. Here are some tips:
- Find what you love and lead with energy.
- Think of yourself as a leader.
- Sometimes you need to lead strongly. Try different ways to lead.
- Set goals and try to do better than them.
F. Leadership takes practice. You need to take risks and learn from mistakes. Learn to share work and motivate others. Be open to new ideas and keep improving your communication. You don't have to lead all the time. Know when your help is needed and help others become leaders too."

In some places, print sales are not falling much. The World Association of Newspapers says global print sales went up 1.1% last year. In Asia, print sales are growing. News magazines are also doing well. They had a 5.4% increase. Books are similar. E-readers like Kindle are popular, but physical book sales are almost the same.
Young people still read newspapers. Nearly 5,000,000 people aged 15 to 35 read national newspapers. In Europe, print sales are different in each country. In Britain, print sales dropped 10.8%. In Germany, the drop is 7%. In France, it is 3.1%.
Online ads do not make as much money as print ads. Many US newspapers have paywalls. They sell print and online access together. Print is important for selling online subscriptions. Print ads make more money than online ads. Keeping both print and online is hard and costs a lot. But print is still important for newspaper brands.'"
CAE_32,C1,"**Taking Photos of People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is often more interesting than one without. But, taking good photos of people can be hard. You need to think about how they move and their expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act differently.
**A. Group Photos**
When taking group photos, don't make people stand in straight lines. Ask them to stand at different angles or levels. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces.
**B. Posing for Photos**
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. They can fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. Taking Photos**
Don't pretend you are not taking a photo. Most people will agree to have their picture taken. But they might feel shy, so you may need to guide them.
**D. Eye Contact**
A photo is strong if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. Remind them before you take the photo.
**E. Looking at Something**
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the photo. This can make the photo interesting.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures show a lot about a person. A smiling child makes us happy. A sad face makes us feel sad. Look for familiar expressions like a thumbs-up or a wink.
**G. Backgrounds**
A background can make a photo more interesting. Make sure the background is not too busy. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger than the background.
**H. Interaction**
Photos of people talking or working together can be good. Look for eye contact or a handshake. Show how people react to each other.
**I. People and Places**
Many photos are taken on holiday. To show people and the place, use a wide-angle lens. Ask people to stand close to the camera. Make sure both the people and the place are clear in the photo.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want the photo. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose. But family photos can be more fun if they are not posed. Candid photos show real moments."

CAE_61,C1,"'Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman talks about 'people skills' that are important for success at work. A The way we work is changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or our training, but also by how we handle ourselves and others. This is important for getting jobs and doing well at work. These skills are called emotional intelligence. They include social skills and personal qualities like being able to understand others and adapt to change. B In today's world, job security is not guaranteed. Personal qualities are important at work. Emotional intelligence means understanding and managing our own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, motivation, and empathy. It is not just about being nice, but also about managing feelings well. C Many businesses see emotional intelligence as important. It helps people work together better. In jobs that need teamwork, emotional intelligence is very important. D Unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. We can get better at handling emotions and understanding others. This is called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned and is important for job success.'"
CAE_52,C1,"'Can the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and phones make it easy to take photos of news events. Social media has changed how people share these photos.

But people still talk about if this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people would take a photo or video of a news event. This means these photos are important for the media. But, to keep a good relationship with people, the media should ask for permission and give rewards for these photos.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Acupuncture: An Old Chinese Medicine**
1. **What is Acupuncture?**
   - Acupuncture is a very old Chinese medicine, about 2,000 years old. It uses small needles to help with pain. It is part of a bigger system that also uses herbs, massage, and exercise.
2. **How Does It Work?**
   - In Chinese medicine, health is when the body's energy, called Qi (say ""chee""), is balanced. Qi moves in the body along lines called meridians. If Qi is blocked, you might feel weak or sick. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulse, looks at your tongue, and asks about your health to find where Qi is blocked. They use needles to help Qi flow better.
3. **Where Are the Needles Put?**
   - There are over 300 points on the body for acupuncture. The needles might not be near where you feel pain. People say they feel a small ache or tingle when the needle is used.
4. **Does It Really Work?**
   - Some doctors think acupuncture helps with pain because it might block pain signals or release natural painkillers in the body. Many people with long-term pain, like back pain or headaches, try acupuncture.
5. **Acupuncture in Surgery**
   - In China, acupuncture is sometimes used instead of medicine to stop pain during surgery. This started in the 1950s. It is used in many operations, like heart surgery. People say it has fewer side effects than regular pain medicine.
6. **Is It Always Helpful?**
   - Not everyone feels better with acupuncture. But many people say it helps with pain after a few visits. It might take six or seven visits to feel a lot better.
7. **Choosing an Acupuncturist**
   - Some doctors learn traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific ideas. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. They should tell you to see a doctor if needed."

CAE_5,C1,"'Handwriting and What It Can Show Some people think handwriting can show a person's character. In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. Companies use handwriting to see if you are right for the job. This is called handwriting analysis or graphology. Some researchers say handwriting can show if a person is sick or has emotional problems. Big companies use graphologists to look at handwriting for important jobs. But many doctors do not believe in graphology. Patricia Marne is a graphologist. She says handwriting can show if a person is smart, honest, or has health problems. She thinks it can also show if someone might be a criminal. She says criminals often have messy handwriting. She also says handwriting can show if a person is under stress or has health issues. For example, if handwriting changes a lot, it might mean something serious is happening. Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to read handwriting well. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a real science. But some doctors say handwriting only shows how a person learned to write and does not mean anything else.'"

CAE_38,C1,"'Chewing gum is popular. Americans chew 12 million pieces every day. Chewing gum has less than ten calories per piece. It is a food and must follow American food rules. Today, gum is mostly made from man-made materials. It has pine resins and softeners for taste and texture. Long ago, the Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the mastic tree. American colonists chewed resin from spruce trees. In the 1800s, people sold spruce gum in the United States. Modern gum started in the 1860s with chicle from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Chicle made gum smoother and more elastic. But growing sapodilla trees is hard. Now, gum makers use man-made materials. Few people still gather chicle. They work in tough conditions with dangerous animals and insects. They climb trees to collect sap. They boil it and make bricks. Life is hard for them. Before, the U.S. bought a lot of chicle. Now, they buy very little. Gum makers use man-made materials to save money. Gum is said to help relax, give energy, and reduce tooth decay. Chewing gum for 20 minutes can help your mouth make more saliva. This helps protect teeth. Gum makers are always looking for new flavors. Most flavors are man-made, but some need natural help. America grows a lot of mint for gum.'"

It was the year when the storms came early, before winter, even before November ended. Before that, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon snow began to fall. In one day, it was 15 centimetres deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we felt only strong gusts of wind; trees moved but the branches stayed strong. We knew we had to worry. The snow and wind were a problem, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which was usually gentle, that was the biggest danger. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams. Soon the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds over the hills. They moved and warned us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow was washed away as more rain came from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was almost too full. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a big waterfall, as the water went over the dam and into the stream. The river was wild near our home, just a couple of metres from our cottage. It was deeper than we had ever seen it, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes came true as the dam held and the waters went down. Many times before the dam was built, the river flooded the nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river and usually all is well; the water from the hills stays behind the dam with just a little overflow sometimes. We can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel the power of the river. Thanks to the dam, we feel our home in the valley is safe.'"

FCE_27,B2,"'Miss Rita Cohen, a small girl with pale skin, came to Seymour's factory one day. She looked very young, but she said she was older than Seymour's daughter, Marie. Rita wore overalls and big shoes. Her hair was curly, and her face was pretty. Seymour was surprised that she was at the University of Pennsylvania. She was studying the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. Sometimes, people called or wrote to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. He sometimes helped students by answering questions or giving a short tour. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class. Marie's class visited the factory once. Seymour showed them how he made gloves. He showed them the table where men shaped and pressed gloves. The table had hot brass hands that looked flat. Marie called them 'pancake hands' when she was little. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour said, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' Rita took notes and asked more questions. Seymour liked that she was interested. He told her about the tannery, where they make leather. He said it was an old industry, with remains found in Turkey. He said his father knew a lot about leather. Seymour asked Rita if she had seen anything made before. She said, 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' Seymour laughed. Rita reminded him of Marie. She was smart and eager to learn. Seymour said, 'We will make you a pair of gloves. You will watch them being made. What size do you wear?''"

She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. When you work for a pop star, you travel a lot. Raquel loves her job and likes her boss. But she has one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a long flight to California, I take sleeping pills to help me relax,' she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde. 'It felt very closed in with small windows.' When not flying, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does paperwork, organizes the diary, attends meetings, and makes travel plans. She didn't apply for the job. She met a pop group manager by chance and got a job. She also took secretarial classes at night. Five years later, she got the PA job. B. David Brown David Brown was an accountant and a golf caddy; a person who carries a golfer's bags. He liked being a caddy more. You would too if you loved golf. But there are problems. You get a small fee and a part of the winnings. He earns between £25,000 and £35,000, but spends a lot on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first worked for golfer Greg Norman. 'You don't just carry bags. You give advice and try to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were noticed by European Tour Productions, and they made him a data administrator. He collects and studies golf statistics. TV commentators, golf magazines, and golfers want his results. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a newspaper. One of his easy tasks is to try food in top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? 'If people can pay, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember than buy a microwave.' His cooking talent got him a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, then a creative director at an ad agency, it was extra money. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant earning 50% less,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job.' He still cooks at home and keeps fit by cycling to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. 'Before that, I loved words and wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about foxes killing chickens. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'It's not easy, I have to work on them,' he says. 'I usually do this in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I type out my morning notes with one finger on an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and I enjoy this part of being a writer. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help.'"

One afternoon, Michael and his friends climbed to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs over the edge and looked at the lake. Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and he jumped off the roof onto the sawdust. He laughed and said, 'I dare you all!' His friends were scared, but one by one, they jumped and laughed too. Later, they went back up to the roof to jump again. Everyone jumped except Michael. He was scared and stayed on the roof. His friends laughed and shouted, 'Come on, Mike!' But Michael was too scared to jump. He stayed on the roof for a long time. The sun was setting, and his clothes were wet from sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped. He fell on the sawdust and lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. Michael felt ashamed and walked home slowly. He was late for dinner. His stepmother was not happy and said, 'You should be home on time for dinner.' She was a kind woman, but Michael did not listen. He was thinking about his friends laughing at him.'"
FCE_44,B2,"'Job Help Are you not happy with your job? Do you want to change it? Kitty Doherty has some advice. Many people go to a careers adviser for help. You write about yourself and take some tests. The tests are called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a report with job ideas and training you might need. I tried Career Analysts, a big company for job advice. The test felt like a school exam. I was with ten people, answering questions quickly. The tests had things like finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the test, I talked to an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts. I agreed with most of it. I was not good at science and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse. But I was happy to hear I made a good choice with journalism. Changing your job does not mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to try Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to think about my skills and interests,' says Donna. She found out she was good at design. But she had to think about the cost of learning design. Other ideas were taking a year off and working in the Far East. 'I used my skills and now work in Public Relations. Career Analysts helped me see what I wanted to do,' she says. She told her friends about it, and they are happy too. Some people need help to find a new job. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services. She worked at a bank for six years and wanted a new challenge. She took tests and found she liked sciences. She had four meetings with an adviser. After the meetings, she decided to study geology. She is happier now. But job advice does not help everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, is a sales representative. She wanted new job ideas. She got many ideas but did not like them. They needed a big pay cut or a lot of training. She felt a friend could give the same advice.'"

Jerome says, 'Many people only go to the dentist when they have pain. They are scared.' To help with this, he tries to make a place where people are not afraid. He does not wear a white coat because it makes people think of pain. Jerome wants people to feel relaxed and happy at the dentist. He uses virtual-reality headsets to help people relax. Patients watch a film about underwater animals while he checks their teeth. Then, they see a video of their own mouth. Most people like this. The office smells nice, like oranges, not like a dentist's office. Jerome says smell is important because the usual dentist smell can make people scared. Jerome is serious about his work. He uses warm water to clean teeth, not sharp tools. It feels strange but not painful. Jerome learned new ways to help patients in the United States. He thinks making it easy for patients is good for everyone. A patient comes in, and Jerome offers him tea and asks what video he wants to watch. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a dentist's office.'"
FCE_39,B2,"'Chocolate is a big business Chocolate comes from South America. Now, people all over the world buy chocolate. At Easter, people in Britain spend a lot of money on chocolate. They spend over £230 million. People buy a lot of chocolate at Easter. They buy more only at Christmas. Chocolate is made from cacao beans. The cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan people in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant. It grows in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree is big like a melon. It has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans. In English, they are often called cocoa beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl. This means 'bitter water' in the Aztec language. The Aztecs used spices in their chocolate drink. The Spanish liked it with cinnamon and sugar. In the late 17th century, people in Europe started to drink chocolate. In 1826, a man from the Netherlands, CJ van Houten, made chocolate powder. In 1847, a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, made the first chocolate bar. They mixed cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, and sugar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate. In 1905, the English company Cadbury made the Dairy Milk bar. Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies try new ideas to sell more chocolate. They make chocolate ice cream, drinks, and desserts. Cacao farmers have problems because the price of cocoa beans went down in the 1980s. Many small farmers had to stop farming. Think about them when you eat your next chocolate bar.'"

I went to meet Kira at her agency. The receptionist said, ""Kira will be a little late."" I thought about models. Are they difficult and vain? Will she be late for a long time? Maybe she won't come. But Kira came in smiling. She was with her mother. Kira wore a simple black dress and trainers. She was friendly and pretty.
Kira is a model because of her sister. Her sister sent Kira's photos to a model competition. Kira did not want to enter. But she became a finalist. She was at school when she got the call. She won the competition. Now, a model agency in London gives her work.

I was under 25 years old, so I could travel for a whole month in Europe. Sleeping in a train corridor is different. The train rocks you to sleep. I carried my things in a backpack. I sometimes threw away socks and books. This is the Inter-Rail way. You do not need to think too much. You just need a ticket. This ticket lets young people travel fast. On my first trip, my friends and I did not know how special the ticket was. We thought it was a cheap way to go to a camp-site in France. But we wanted to travel more. There was always another country to see. And it cost us nothing extra. We liked culture, but this was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans. We only saw easy-to-reach sights. We did not want guided tours. We wanted something different. I liked seeing the view from the station. We wanted to have fun. We were like other Inter-Railers. We shared food, water, money, and music. Travel is exciting. A city is just a name until you see it. You see Europe by watching the landscapes and people. You understand Europe better this way. Other people's holiday photos are boring. The train trip is a personal experience. Europe is big. Inter-Rail helps you see this. But it took us some time to understand."
FCE_37,B2,"'It is very sad to arrive at an airport in another country and find out your bags are not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a place with a different climate and have the wrong clothes. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens. Even good airlines make mistakes, and they cannot promise your bags will be on the same flight, especially if you change planes. 
Airlines ask you to check in early so there is enough time for your bags to get on the plane. Sometimes, flights are late because of extra security checks or air traffic problems, and this can cause bags to be lost. Also, people can make mistakes, or the label on your bag can fall off. Big airports, called 'hubs', have many bags to handle, and problems can happen. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had many passengers changing planes. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have problems sometimes. 
To avoid losing your bags, try to take direct flights and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline and give yourself more time between flights. Label your bags with your home and holiday addresses and flight numbers. If your bags are lost, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a report before you leave the airport.'"

There are old stories about kingfishers. One story says a moon goddess became a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew high and got its blue color from the sky. 
Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. Their feathers reflect light. This makes them look blue or green. 
Charlie James likes to watch kingfishers. He hides and waits for them. He used an old blanket to hide. He waited near a kingfisher's favorite place. The bird came close to him. 
Charlie took many years to take a good picture of a kingfisher. He spent a lot of time near streams. He missed school to watch kingfishers.

FCE_50,B2,"'MUSIC SCHOOLS FOR SPECIAL CHILDREN What can you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents do not see their child's talent until the child becomes upset. Regular schools may not have the right help for children who are very good at music. These children might do well at a special music school. In Britain, there are five special music schools. These schools help children aged seven to eighteen to get better at music. They learn from professional musicians. Children at these schools spend a lot of time on music. They have lessons, play in groups, and practice singing and instruments. They also learn subjects like English, maths, and science. These schools are private, and classes are small. Most children live at the school. This means they are with other children who love music too. There are some problems. The schools are expensive, but they try to help with money if the child is very talented. Also, some parents do not want their young children to live away from home. Some school directors think it is not good for very young children to be in such a strict place. They want to help children become happy and balanced people. Being away from other children can be hard. Some children lose interest in music as they grow up. The schools watch the children closely and help them if needed. Some children feel they do not learn enough other subjects. Many smart children want to learn more than just music. It might be better to wait until the child is older to decide about a special music school. Some children can do well in regular schools with good music programs. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges. But this is hard for families who do not live near big cities.'"

There is a train from Cannes to Italy. It goes by the sea. The view is always beautiful. You can see nice houses and gardens. The people on the train are fun. There are tourists and local people. They all enjoy the trip. Raj Patel - Explorer I like many train trips. My favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip. I was too young and stayed with my aunt. I first saw a big train station in London. It was amazing. Betty Cooper - Novelist I love the Blue Train. My husband and I took it on our honeymoon in France. He gave me a pink dress on the train. I love pink now. The trip was nice. We went to Egypt by boat. It was a great way to relax after our wedding. Martin Brown - Journalist We were on a world trip. We had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The train did not have a set time. Many people got on the train. Some even rode on the roof. The view at night was beautiful. It was like a dream. Arisu Mezuki - Actress I did not see many trains as a child. I lived in Singapore and Cyprus. I saw more trains as a teenager. I made a film in Yorkshire with a train. The train was old but nice. I love steam trains now. When I went back last year, everything was the same.'"
FCE_8,B2,"'Do you want to publish your story? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I wrote a story. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice writing. To sell your story, you need to know about the writing world. Read a lot to learn what publishers like. Visit your library and bookshops. Publishers always want new writers. If you want to write love stories, find magazines that publish them. Read these magazines to see what stories they like. Writers often ask, 'My story was rejected. Should I keep trying?' I say yes, but maybe the story is not ready. Many new writers send their work too soon. If you wrote only one story, it might not get published. Success usually comes after many tries. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Each story will be better. Don't throw them away; improve them. Don't show your work to others too soon. Remember, all writers face rejection. Try to join a writing course or group. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day.'"

It was the last day of a bad year. I was at the Baltimore train station. I wanted to take the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were many people at the station. The benches were full. Many college students sat on the floor with their bags.
A man with grey hair was talking to people. He looked rich. He wore nice clothes. He asked a woman, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said no. Then he asked a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I wanted to talk to her too. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""No, I am going to New York."" The man said, ""Thanks,"" and moved on.
I was going to Philadelphia. But the man did not ask me. He thought I looked unreliable. He asked an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Wilmington."" He moved on. He looked worried.
He asked a woman reading a book, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Yes."" He asked her for a favor. I listened. The man said, ""My daughter is flying today. She forgot her passport. She is in Philadelphia. Can you take her passport to her?""
The woman asked, ""Why don't you go?"" The man said, ""My wife is in a wheelchair. I can't leave her alone."" The man had a big envelope. It looked strange. I thought, ""Be careful, lady."""

My chance was to run a restaurant. When I found the restaurant, it was not in good shape, but it was perfect for me. I remembered my childhood. My mother worked in a factory, and I was sad because I was alone. So, I wanted time for family. My wife took care of the children and helped with the business. We lived above the restaurant. We always ate meals together. This was good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. They talked to our customers from a young age. Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into a bath like a pool and got hurt. When he was older, he worked for pocket money. He did small jobs and worked in the kitchen. He had a lot of money at school. He was disciplined. He woke up early. It was nice to see him help in the family business. Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. At 15, he was as good as the other workers. He sometimes was in charge. He made many meals. I knew he would work in cooking. When he needed work experience for school, I sent him to a friend's restaurant. Gary now plays the drums and has a band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if his music becomes popular. I told Gary to focus on one thing. He understood when I said, 'Gary, you need to succeed by 30.' Gary went to cooking school at 17. On his first day, he finished his work quickly and helped others. I am very proud of Gary. His TV show is very successful. I always told him to work hard for what he wants. He listened to me sometimes, and I am happy about that.'"

Jo was the only one going to Dublin. Jo's mother wanted her to stay in the hostel. Her father hoped it was warm. Her sisters thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo saw an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own TV, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to her work at the post office. Jo hoped it was nice and not too expensive. There was no line for this flat. It was more like 'Third Girl Wanted.' Jo thought it might be too fancy because it had a TV. The house was red-brick and had a basement. The flat was upstairs. A girl was leaving and said, 'Desperate place. They're both awful.' Jo went up. A girl named Nessa said, 'Did you see that girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' Jo asked, 'What did she do?' Nessa said the girl just looked around and made a face. Pauline, another girl, wore a very colorful shirt. Jo was surprised. Pauline was a punk. Jo said, 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office.'

Dolphins are smart and can feel human emotions. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But real life is hard for dolphins. The seas are dirty and have too much fishing. One type of dolphin, the North Sea harbour porpoise, has lost many of its kind. We think dolphins are safe, but they are not. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, we see striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. Striped and common dolphins live far in the sea. We do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be near the coast. Now, they are only in a few places in Scotland and Wales. They have skin injuries and are stressed. Dolphins have complex lives, so it is hard to know why their numbers are going down. Overfishing is a big problem. Dolphins need fish to eat. If there are no fish, dolphins cannot find food. They can also get caught in fishing nets. Many dead dolphins are found on beaches in France and Cornwall. They have marks from nets. Pollution is another problem. Waste in the sea can make dolphins sick. Pesticides can build up in their bodies. A baby dolphin can die from its mother's milk if it has too many pesticides. Noise is also a problem. Dolphins use sound to understand their world. Noise from ships and oil wells can disturb them. We do not know how much this affects them.'"

Exercise helps you sleep better and feel less stressed. There are many types of exercise like jogging, lifting weights, and aerobics. Be careful not to exercise too hard at first. If you are not sure, ask your doctor what is good for you. Good posture is important too. Stand up straight and imagine a balloon pulling your head up. This helps you breathe better and look slimmer. Stretching is also important. It makes your body flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching four or five times a week is good. A good exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, working out, and cooling down.'"

FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
When you meet someone for the first time, they quickly decide what they think about you. They look at your clothes, eyes, body, and how you talk. Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She said, ""I worked hard for my degree. I was very confident when I finished school."" She tried to get a job at a school. She had an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I saw a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she said. ""I wanted to change, but I didn't want to be late. Being on time is important."" Mary did not get the job. Her friend said the Head Teacher thought, ""If she doesn't look her best for an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look after themselves will look after their jobs. In an interview, you should look your best."" Some people forget this. Janet Goodwood worked for ten years in an office. She wanted a better job but did not get an interview. She asked why. The boss said she did not look like a manager. He told her to dress better next time. Janet was surprised. She thought her work was good, and clothes should not matter.
How you move and your face also matter in an interview. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian says 7% of our message is words, 38% is voice, and 55% is face. If your face and words are different, people believe your face. So, make sure your face and words match. Do not look too eager for the job. Sheila Rice, a marketing expert, got a job offer in an interview. She was very happy. But because she was too excited, the boss gave her less money. She thinks she could have got more if she was calmer.
What you say and how you say it is important. David Artesio, a job agency manager, says to learn about the company before the interview. Talk about something you like about the company. This shows you are interested. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, says to have some questions ready. Speak in short sentences, not long ones. She says, ""Good communicators use short sentences."""

FCE_33,B2,"**Shopping with Children**
Shopping with children can be very hard. One mother says, ""They want everything. They see cereal, videos, and comics. I can't buy all these things. I feel bad when I say no, but I also feel bad when I buy them. I try not to take them shopping, but then they don't learn how to choose things. I can't win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, mostly on TV. These ads make children want things. Parents find it hard to explain why they can't buy everything. Ads make things look very nice, even if they are not healthy.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Parents care about what their children eat. They have ideas about healthy food, but ads give children a different view. Parents don't like competing with ads and saying no to their children.""
TV ads can't tell children to ask parents to buy things, but they still make children want them. Parents feel stressed deciding what to buy. One mother says her son watches ads but they talk about them. Now, he doesn't ask for things she won't buy.
Parents sometimes say no to children but buy treats for themselves. Mike, a father, says, ""We say no to sweets for our son but buy chocolate for us. It's nice to buy good things, and children want that too. But I get annoyed by their asking. It depends on my mood. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to always say the same thing.""
Supermarkets can help by not putting sweets near checkouts or having play areas for children. Parents might buy less, but more people might shop there because it's easier without children asking for things."

FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating is very old. People have skated for thousands of years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. Later, they used iron skates. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was important. 
In 1924, a girl named Sonja Henie changed skating. She made it more athletic. Now, skating is both art and sport. It is beautiful and hard work.
When you start skating, balance is important. You need to control your body. Your legs should be a little bent, and your knees should be soft. Relaxing is very important. To start, your heels should be close, and your feet should point out. Push with one foot and move the other foot a little. 
Falling is normal. Even good skaters fall. To fall safely, stay relaxed. To get up, use your hands and knees, then stand.
There are different types of skating: figure skating, freestyle, speed skating, and more. First, learn figure skating. Then, try freestyle. 
Good skaters look relaxed. They move easily. To be like them, do exercises. Warm up your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to stay loose.
Skating helps balance, coordination, and relaxation. It is good for your heart and lungs. Skating with swimming or jogging is great for health."

FCE_29,B2,"""We are getting taller. Chris Greener was 14 years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole?' because Chris was already very tall. Now, Chris is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain. People in Europe are getting taller by about 1 cm every ten years. More tall people are being born. This is not because we are becoming a super race. We are becoming like our ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Long ago, people ate many different plants and animals. About 9,000 years ago, farming started. People began eating mostly wheat, rice, and corn. This was not good for health. People became less healthy and shorter. Now, in places like Europe, the US, and Japan, people eat better again. The average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. But there are problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less space in planes and trains.

We see them happy on game shows and wonder - who are these people? Some people think studio audiences are not very important. Even TV workers sometimes do not respect them. I thought studio audiences were people who wanted to be famous. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of jobs and backgrounds. TV wants different people for different shows. Some people like to watch TV at home and do not understand why others go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio to watch what you can see at home? Some think people want to be on TV for a second. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She came because she wanted to be on TV. Others are curious to see behind the scenes. But many just come because a friend gave them a ticket. Few people have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit with strangers and see signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This is true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager says, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a difference between watching in a studio and at home? Claire thinks sitting in a studio is 'more exciting'. Charlotte liked being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were far away, so I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch TV, but that is not important. For most people, it is fun and free entertainment.'"

I have written letters all my life. I started with small notes to my mother. She always told me to write thank-you letters for gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy. When I was 18, I moved to London to study. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote to me. My father also wrote funny letters sometimes. The letters talked about everyday things. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more. I also got letters from boyfriends. Writing letters made our relationships better. I could say things in writing that were hard to say in person. I like letters with birthday or Christmas cards. It is nice to get news from the whole year. I also get letters from friends in other countries. I have a friend in Sri Lanka, one in Australia, and one in Canada. I also have a friend in France. We met in a restaurant and started writing to each other. She writes in French, and I practice my French with her. We have visited each other. My biggest letter-writing success was meeting my American friend in Texas. We wrote letters for 29 years before we met. People were surprised our friendship lasted so long. My children also write letters. They have penfriends in Texas. I think writing letters is important. Do not let it disappear.'"
FCE_54,B2,"**Title: Tourists Damage Old Rock Art in France**
In France, there are very old pictures on rocks in the mountains. These pictures are 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and gods. Many people visit this place to see the pictures.
But, some tourists are not careful. They write on the rocks and damage the pictures. Some people even take pieces of the rock home. This is bad for the pictures.
Jean Clottes is an expert on rock art. He says if people keep damaging the pictures, they will be gone in 50 years. Some people want to close the area to protect the pictures. Others think people should still visit but with guides.
Annie Echassoux, another expert, says the area is easier to reach now, so more people visit. She thinks guides and ropes can help protect the pictures. She believes money must be found to save the pictures for the future."
FCE_32,B2,"**Shopping with Children**
Shopping with children can be hard. One mother says, ""They want everything. They see cereal, videos, and comics. I can't buy all these things. I feel bad when I say no, but I also feel bad when I buy them. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn to choose.""
Research shows children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, mostly on TV. These ads make children want things. Parents find it hard to explain why they can't buy everything. Ads make things look fun and exciting.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Parents care about what their children eat. They have ideas about healthy food, but ads give children a different view. Parents don't like competing with ads and saying no to their children.""
TV ads can't tell children to ask parents to buy things, but they still make children want to buy. Parents feel stressed deciding what to buy. One mother talks to her children about ads and food. Her son now thinks ads are not true, so they have fewer problems in the store.
Parents know they are not always fair. Mike, a father, says, ""We say no to sweets for our son but buy treats for ourselves. It's normal for children to want nice things. I say yes if I'm in a good mood. It's hard to always say the same thing.""
Supermarkets can help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less, but they would enjoy shopping more without their children's demands."
FCE_65,B2,"'Climbing Walls Long ago, climbers went to mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, inside or outside. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. The National Indoor Arena, where the event is held, is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both have a big wall. In the past, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they walked or climbed in Scotland. To stay fit, they used brick or stone buildings to practice. Later, sports centers built special climbing walls. Don Robinson, a teacher, made a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s. But these walls had problems. They were only straight up and down. Real cliffs have different shapes. In 1985, Francois Savigny from France made new climbing shapes. These could be put on walls and changed when needed. French companies also made panels with steel frames. These were lighter and could be moved easily. Climbers could have new challenges all the time.'"

Some friends might say you are crazy, but others might not. Everyone will give different advice. It is your choice, and you must be responsible for it. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee you will get a job after training. You need luck and talent. People want new faces and talent. Acting can be exciting and glamorous. Talent is natural skill and imagination. It also needs courage and belief in yourself. Why do people want to act? It is hard to say. In the theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is important in all acting. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job. Disappointment is hard for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work. Then, you get an audition, but you might not get the job. Actors do not talk about their chances. They find ways to handle stress and rejection. Nobody likes rejection. From the start, you say you are ready and talented for the job. It is up to you. If you do not care, no one else will.'"

The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole?' because Chris was already very tall. Now, Chris is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain. People in Europe are getting taller by about one centimeter every ten years. More tall people are being born. This is not because we are becoming a super race. We are becoming like our ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Long ago, people ate many different plants and animals. About 9,000 years ago, farming started. People began eating mostly wheat, rice, and corn. This made people less healthy. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became less healthy. But farming could feed more people. Now, in Europe, the US, and Japan, people eat better again. The average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. But there are problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less space in planes and trains. We cannot grow forever. Scientists think we might stop growing taller at 193 cm.

They put new soil on top to make grass, flowers, and rocks. Many trees and plants were put in the village. These plants had to be strong because the village is near the sea and it can be very windy. Some plants came from far away places like Canada and New Zealand. Colin Sims made the village. He made over 100 small buildings in nine years. He used stone, wood, and plastic to make them strong. At first, he needed help to learn about the materials, but soon he became very good at it. The village is very popular because it looks real and is well made. The small buildings show British styles.

FCE_69,B2,"'Every week, British newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. Pop stars sometimes pose for photos, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people because they show private moments. Few people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC is an organization that helps with these problems. These pictures do not help the public. For example, a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony does not help anyone. The actress was upset about these pictures before, but she did not complain. The PCC did not investigate, which is surprising. They should also look into a story about a pop star's love life. The pop star did not complain either. Should the PCC do something about these attacks? It seems like a good idea. It would stop newspapers from publishing such pictures. Photographers would not make money from these photos. But if the PCC acted like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would they decide to investigate? Should they ask the victim to complain? If the person does nothing, should the PCC still act? Celebrities might expect the PCC to help them, and be upset if it doesn't. The PCC cannot watch all newspapers and magazines. Also, people might not want more attention from an investigation. Most people want to forget and move on. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story they want to hide. Even the PCC could become a problem. A British comedian was photographed on his honeymoon and family holiday. He did not complain because he feared the newspaper would make fun of him. People think they will be targets if they challenge the newspapers. This is a difficult problem to solve.'"

We are not talking about people looking for a temporary job or leaving a bad job quickly. We are talking about people who want to move up in their career. You have some skills and know what you want. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. Do you want to be an expert in one area, get more responsibility, or try something new? Choose your second job carefully.

Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to forget my fears. C Lisa People think I'm confident, but when I look calm, I'm scared. In TV, you must look confident. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous. My mom said, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone worries about themselves.' I remember this. You gain confidence by doing things that scare you.

If the line breaks, the finder keeps the kite. I have many more.' He showed me a pile of kites. They were all 120cm wide and long, made of paper and bamboo. We sat under the trees near the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan. We watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms. Helpers held the kites, and people waited to fly them. When the whistle blew, the kites went up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition. It lasts five days every year. They entered four different kite designs. The kites were judged on decoration, how well they flew, and how stable they were. 'Flying kites is easy,' said Adnan, 'but making them is hard. Come to my house, and I'll show you.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to fix his kite, but I couldn't. I explored the south of the state. I drove towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with rainforests.

After university, she moved to London and worked in advertising. She needed nice clothes for work events but could not buy expensive ones. So, she made her own skirts and tops. Her friends liked them and asked her to make clothes for them too. A small shop in London agreed to sell her clothes. They sold well, so she left her job and started her own clothing business with a PS20,000 loan. Her parents were happy and supported her. Now, her clothes are in over 70 stores, and her business makes over PS500,000. Her clothes are in fashion magazines, and she designs for pop stars. She is happy to win the award and says, ""I love my job, but I worked hard for it.""'"

The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cold south. People call it the 'famous Ghan', but it is often late. A train line from Adelaide to Alice Springs was made in the 1920s, but there was a lot of flooding. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The train is not very fast and most people on it are on holiday. The Ghan is not a luxury train, but the food is very good. The railway was first made to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia through Darwin and the train would save time and money. The Ghan says it is the world's first north-south railway. When I waited to get on the Ghan, everyone was excited. Most of the people on the train were older Australians. Our first stop was Katherine, where the train waited for four hours. Some people took a boat trip. I got off at Alice Springs and went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. We walked around the rock and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop here. After Alice Springs, the view is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land and cattle. On the third day, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My trip was over. The train did not do everything the ads said, but it took me to some amazing places in Australia.'"

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, my first big winter climb. We climbed the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters up - the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain. We had tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need them because the snow is very hard, like ice. Some people in the group were very good climbers. We took safety things like lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, with no strong winds, but we were still a little nervous. Ben Nevis in winter is always hard. The path went up and my legs felt tired. I was the slowest in the group, so I stopped more. The others waited for me, but when I got there, they started again. I told myself to train more next time. After 200 meters, we started Tower Ridge. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain is very steep on each side. We had to stay calm and watch every step. After seven hours, we got to the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we saw mist. Going back down to camp is also hard. You need to read a map well. A wrong turn can be dangerous. I was happy we took turns with the map. I only felt happy when I was safe in the tent. But I made it to the top.'"

This week is very exciting. We moved to a new school building! The school is made of wood, like our old school. It is special because it is good for the environment. It took a long time to build. We watched the builders work. It was noisy, and sometimes they stopped because of the rain. We thought it would never be finished.
Now, we have five big classrooms. They are bigger than the ones in our old school. We also have a room for town meetings, a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We will use the changing rooms when the new sports field is ready.
When you come to our school, you see there are no heaters. The heat comes from us, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside. When we sing, it sounds like a concert hall!
There is a tree on the roof. The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We saw it yesterday. It is very big and goes around fast. We took pictures for our website.
We are using the new school, but some parts are not ready yet. We have to go to the old school hall for plays. The new hall will be ready next year. We are happy with our new school. Our teachers say we will learn faster here!"

Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would be outside for the weekend, but we did not know what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning, and the others went rock-climbing. Then we changed at lunchtime.

But for the first day, it was open for 24 hours. However, the shop closed after 30 minutes. A police officer said: 'We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside were angry. They thought everything would sell before they could enter. They did not want to wait quietly. Also, many cars were trying to get to the car park. Some people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop.

New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod. This town grew very fast in 1909 and was the biggest city in Alaska for a short time. In summer, boats could bring things to these towns, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dogs to pull sleds. They took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for the dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when planes started to be used instead. But in 1925, a disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine was far away in Anchorage. Planes were new, and it was too cold to fly. The only good pilot was not there. So, they used dog teams to take the medicine. The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, from Norway, traveled the first 400 kilometers. His dog Togo helped him in the snow. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dogs in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. Balto saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Now, there is a dog sled race every year from Anchorage to Nome. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.'"

He went to see Maria and saw her playing football. He saw she was very fast. 'He talked to me about running. I did not know what he meant. I only knew football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard, and my legs hurt.' Jose talked to her parents and said she could be successful and help her family. They agreed to let her train. In 1991, she went to the United States to train. She did not want to go before because she would miss her family. The girls in the US were different from her. She says, 'They were good at sports, but I worried about my family having food, and they worried about clothes and make-up. They did not know much about me or my problems. But I was happy to be there. The trainers were very good, and I learned a lot.' Today, Maria still runs and lives in South Africa with her mother for most of the year.'"

It was fun to watch, but I liked it best when my band played! We have a good jazz band at my school, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to join get in. But anyone who wants to play can come to practice before school. We also listen to jazz after school. We go to jazz camps in the summer, too. I have been to a few and learned a lot. Adults are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher says pop music is not hard enough for people who love music. I like jazz because it is new and old. You can make your own music and feel part of jazz history. My school is lucky. We have great teachers and parents who help us. Without them, we could not play music!'"

'Okay,' we said, 'but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are hard to move, Ben's band friends came to our house with their guitars and other things. So, for a few hours each week, the house is loud with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby is good for us: when the band plays, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music sounds strange, they are nice and polite boys. I don't know if they are good at music, but they play in local clubs for young people. We worry they won't study enough because of the band, but this hasn't happened yet.

In the afternoon, they do useful activities like helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution. Students come from different countries and backgrounds. Not many can pay the PS20,000 fees for two years, so there are grants. A quarter of the students are British, and many get government help.

Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house break-ins have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of break-ins happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. He said that night-time break-ins are rare because families are usually at home then. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange.

Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling movies to other countries. Indian actors make more movies each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they do not get as much money. This is why most Bollywood movies only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood movie costs more than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years.

A young man from England named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he is already famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about many good restaurants in France. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked this so much that he decided not to buy many clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! Why did he open a restaurant? Because he loves cooking. Was it easy?

About 300 years ago, London started to grow. The city was dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who took money in the streets, so people stayed at home. In 1750, Henry Fielding paid some people to stop thieves. They were like police and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London was very big and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force started with 3000 officers. Most men walked, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all police in London were men. Today, London police get good pay, and the few who ride horses get even better pay.'"

They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish under the ice. Bob Marvisch has come here for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,' he says. 'First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I like to have some chocolate or other snack! Today I have caught twenty-five!
