CPE_15,C2,"'Garbage in, garbage out Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have their rubbish collected regularly. They put their rubbish bags or bins outside, and a special truck takes them away. Usually, this service is paid for through local taxes, so everyone pays the same amount, no matter how much rubbish they have. But the more rubbish people throw away, the more it costs to collect and dispose of it. Economists think that if rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much. One solution is to make people pay for each bag of rubbish they produce. This might encourage them to throw away less and recycle more. However, two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea does not always work as expected. They studied several American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags for rubbish bags. Only bags with these labels are collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, people had to pay 80 cents for each tagged bag. The number of bags collected fell by 37%, but people just packed more rubbish into each bag. The weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In other towns without this system, the weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying. The good news was that recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be because of the fee, as many people were already recycling. In another study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that higher prices for rubbish stickers only slightly reduced the amount of rubbish. A 10% increase in price reduced rubbish by just 0.3%. This is because people would need to buy less of everything to reduce rubbish a lot. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important as price. In richer towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, should we stop charging for rubbish? Not really. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. We need detailed economic models to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect.'"
CPE_19,C2,"'Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. Does it help your mind, character, and relationships? This is important. If your skills make you boring or too busy to learn new things or be creative, then no amount of money or status will make up for it. I am exploring how work can help us grow as people, not just be shaped for business needs. Work should be more than making money; it should help us live better, find new talents, and meet different people. But this doesn't mean ending unemployment. As people get more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and useful. Work should be like art, with happy people at the center. Even jobs like doctors and accountants are not as appealing as before. Doctors are stressed, accountants worry about ethics, and architects can't always be creative. Middle managers are losing confidence. Companies are getting smaller, and new ideas like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't made employees more committed. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match their company's values. I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I look at what people can do and how courage is made. I focus on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts work on making companies last longer and earn more money, but we also need to think about what kind of people we want to be and who we want to work with. Are we really alive at work, or are we just working because we have no other choice? For example, hotel workers often have low pay and long hours, even though they are smart and lively. Hotels haven't changed much since the old days. They could be places where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could do more than just basic tasks. If hotels cared about their staff's dreams, they could offer more services. But accountants say hotels should focus on one main thing to make money. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one. Work is a relationship. People want jobs that let them be independent and choose their colleagues and customers. They need to talk with people from different fields. Communication is important, but real conversation is more than just talking. It's about understanding each other and creating respect. This kind of conversation can change the world a little bit each time it happens.'"
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand. This is an agricultural metaphor, but it also represents modern ideas of growth and spreading information. Broadcasting involves central resources that spread information widely, like seeds growing into a harvest.
When television was invented, it was organized as a central 'mass' medium, even though it could have been a two-way communication tool like the telephone. This centralization matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Although there were experiments with different ways of organizing television, they remained just experiments.
In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain tried two-way television as a replacement for the telephone. Magazines like Radio News showed how to build TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. This ended the chance for television to become a more equal and widespread form of communication.
In the USA, television was seen as a competitor to the film industry and was often watched in public places. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was common in the 1930s. Although public reception of TV was a threat to home-based viewing, it did not last. Manufacturers saw the potential for selling TVs to homes once prices dropped. As people gained better living standards, the idea of the home as an entertainment center became possible.
Broadcasting was important for governments to reach citizens with information and to create a sense of national community. It became the main way to organize radio and television. Broadcasting also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information for political and cultural participation.
Today, television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. It may only refer to a specific way of organizing technology during a certain time in history."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much you are influenced, try not to read any advertising signs next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages affect us in strong ways without us knowing. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, especially how they form, their water systems, and their living organisms. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature. They make us curious and eager to learn, so a lot of research has been done on them. In places where caves have affected our lives, they have been studied even more. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many people who watched the weather without any tools started the study of weather, which has become a very technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now give us weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Weather science uses many long words that are hard to understand for most people. But simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience is key to turning computer data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can still give important information to weather experts."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
Until recently, I thought opera was mainly theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. However, I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the audience usually speaks the same language as the performers.
At musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, like me, do not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A great singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match. We know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when running, but they are much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand an actor's skill and are not as impressed by something that seems close to what they could do. They are not usually amazed when an actor delivers a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences. Many people attend both. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play is.
The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes. Music in live performance is full of passion, humor, and emotion. It can go wrong, and it reaches into the listener's imagination. However, music often feels hierarchical, with strict dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists. Also, audiences sometimes interrupt performances by clapping at the wrong times, which can disrupt the flow of the music.
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to bring new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience and life-changing for many in the audience, who also participated.
I wish music had more of the risk and excitement that theatre can have. Sometimes, using unusual locations can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists into unexpected places. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe music conventions can and should change. I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete. However, I don't like sand in its natural form. For me, it is a difficult barrier between the car park and the sea. It blows in your face, gets in your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, when you step onto a towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more comes out when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. I don't like sand at all.
**Lock and Key**
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security. In the past, they used a beam behind the door, but now we have electronic locks with many combinations. The need to keep out 'bad guys' is still strong. Locks and keys are comforting. Some companies have tried using computerised locks with smart cards, but people don't like them. At work, it might be okay, but at home, everyone prefers using a real key. So, when a locksmith company made a new electronic system, they included a real metal key.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because I don't understand modern art well. I like some of it, like furry things, neon lights, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more, I would have more opinions. But art is not about writing essays; it's about letting it speak to you. This idea sounds great, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels. They explained the art and what it was trying to say. Instead of just staring at the pictures, these labels helped me understand."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
When books are turned into movies, a lot of the story is often cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also be interesting. While working on a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still keep the main idea. This doesn't mean the original book was bad. It's just that books and movies tell stories in different ways. In books, certain details are repeated to help readers remember them, like character traits or who is speaking. In plays, which are mostly dialogue, this repetition can be more stylized. Some modern plays use so much extra language that it's hard to understand what is really being said.
**Watching Movies**
Watching movies can make you feel like you're in a different world. For the time the movie is playing, you forget about real life. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, you return to reality. In the past, some people thought movies were just for fun and not real art. Our parents and teachers often said this. They liked movies but didn't see them as art.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were no clear signs or main entrance. There were three main entrances, but only one led to where you wanted to go. Visitors were rare because the studio didn't want them. But the people who worked there knew their way around. Together, they made movies that brought romance and adventure to people, helping them escape from everyday problems for a few hours.
**Film-makers**
Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores have many guides on how to write scripts and make films. Universities offer courses, and there are contests to win cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his film El Mariachi. This film cost $7,000 and made him famous. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his first big film before he turned 25. In the past, filmmakers took longer to succeed. They worked in different jobs in the studio before directing their first film. John Huston was 35 when he made The Maltese Falcon, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without studio support, new filmmakers have to be more independent."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of small, dull houses made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose as he walked up to a house. I have forgotten most of my early life. But I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, I have other memories - faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the big mansion at Earlham. My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I knew she was different. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, alone even in a room full of people. She also had a strong sense of proper behavior, which was unusual in West Earlham. This sometimes led to furious cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. I didn't understand this as a child, and I still don't fully understand it now. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules. Over time, other people appeared in these early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and not fully approved by the others. Later, I realized they were not good company. They talked about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I was part of. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders. I felt I had to grow up quickly to escape it. This was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat in an armchair. After your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. Some lucky children had a mother with a bike and a child seat. I think my mother let other children take me to school. If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays. Those days, you sometimes saw the world outside West Earlham: an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about the Merchant Navy, a charity event at a house far away where a woman gave out lemonade and talked about the League of Pity, a junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying they were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about people wanting money, and she had no respect for politicians. She thought of the House of Commons as a place where rich people took money from the public. I might exaggerate. I might ignore her good qualities and focus on her faults. But my mother had little kindness left in her. To be fair, she did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me in my 'good clothes' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn't mind this activity and even started to have opinions on the paintings. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was the only time I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid, turning into a light drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Even if I didn't know everyone by name, each house was special to me as a child. I remember the little rain channels in the cement that I would pass on my roller skates or scooter. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get smaller, and the front yards became tiny. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brick and big doors. Gilbert didn't want an open space because it was hard to separate work from home life. So, he used a large plastic sheet to divide the space. It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen. He wanted the kitchen to be a place for both cooking for friends and making coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel, he used light wood for the floors. His flat has both modern furniture and sentimental pieces from his parents or markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer known for his adventurous life. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was exciting like a thriller and imaginative like a novel. Chatwin often mixed fact with fiction to make his stories more interesting. He believed that through travel, one could discover fascinating histories.
**Swimming**
During a summer rainstorm in 1996, I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles on the water, and the storm's noise covered the birdsong. It was then that I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in a pool. Many places today are labeled and explained, but activities like walking, cycling, and swimming help us connect with nature. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear reason. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children bond. Many think tears in children show they need help. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the look of it. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and connection. Tears can also happen for other reasons. We might cry to show we care about someone facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially when with others. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but not everyone knows its effects. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are important.
The problem is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. In the last 100 years, human actions have increased certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate now and will continue to do so. We know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years, showing they are related. Evidence shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this is partly due to human pollution.
Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These programs use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, and other factors. However, they are not perfect and can be slow and costly. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know they are complex. Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before.
GCMs suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes will impact the environment and humans. Climate change can affect where plants and animals live and how they provide benefits to humans. This includes food, water, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some changes might be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat production since 1952.
However, many predicted effects of climate warming are not good. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry areas or places with pollution. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed. Another effect is changes to glaciers, which will impact ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making transport and exploration easier but increasing iceberg dangers.
The most visible effect of global warming may be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and ice melts. With half of the world's population living near coasts, rising sea levels could cause severe problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island countries could disappear, causing devastating effects for their people and cultures, and challenges for countries that take in displaced people."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This is the profile for the first astronauts to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to send a capsule on 5 January 2018 are successful. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, because saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are in the right position is in 2031. It is a big challenge, but the race is on to create new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the work to reach these goals will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**Aesthetics**
Sometimes, the existence of art makes it hard to understand theories about it. This is because art, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, exists physically. People often think of art as just these physical objects, separate from human experience. But real art is about what these objects do in our experiences. This misunderstanding can make it hard to truly understand art.
Some art pieces are so admired and perfect that they create traditions that block new insights. When art becomes ""classic,"" it often gets separated from the human experiences that created it and the effects it has on our lives. This separation makes it hard to see the true meaning of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often seen as something separate from other human activities and achievements.
A key task for someone writing about the philosophy of art is to connect art with everyday life experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how mountains are connected to the earth. Similarly, those who study art must show how it connects to everyday life.
To understand art, we sometimes need to step away from it and look at ordinary experiences that we don't usually see as artistic. We need to start with the basic experiences that catch our attention and give us enjoyment. Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without thinking of them as art. But these are the arts that are most alive for the average person today.
When art is only seen in museums and galleries, people look for enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Many people who disagree with the idea of art being only in museums still think of art as separate from everyday life. The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often think of lions as amazing hunters working together like a team. In the evening light, a group of lions quietly moves and surrounds their prey. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, like catching their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. We started our research in 1978, hoping to learn why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare away rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its young survive, then working together might not always be best. If an animal is too helpful, others might benefit more. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could find the answer in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are often inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand them.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a new trend in rock music in the country. The old style of serious music with loud guitars was replaced by a lighter, more melodic sound. The album mixed social themes with fun sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. It was full of humor and irony, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting different styles and writing songs. They sang about typical English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its deeper, more emotional songs like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" ""New Life"" was a high-quality album with 16 great tracks and no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from ancient times. I first heard about them from a story my mother told me. An old woman offered nine books to the King of Rome for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three books and offered the rest for the same price. He refused again, and she burned three more. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I learned a lesson about salesmanship and life from this story. I was often a lonely child and wanted to play with others, but they refused. My mother told me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something meaningful to me. I'm not a big traveler, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to visit. I like exploring ruins because I enjoy traveling through time in my mind.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript to a publisher, it usually goes into a pile called the ""slush pile."" This pile is sorted by a junior editor or an experienced person who works part-time. They don't have much power, but they want to find something original. The junior editor wants to make a name for themselves, and the experienced person wants to keep their job. If they like your novel, they will show it to a senior editor. Then, it will be discussed at a meeting. The editor must explain why your novel is good and if it can sell well. They also consider if you, as an author, have a future and if you can help promote the book. Publishers often want to meet new authors before making a final decision."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising Challenges in the Early 1990s**
If you worked in advertising during the early 1990s, it was likely a very tough time. The economy was in a recession, which was worse than expected. In Britain, for example, the economy shrank, interest rates were high, people spent less money, many lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. Every business felt the impact, especially car and building companies, which saw a 30% drop in business.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They had to support their companies' profits while working with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies started to focus more on making products that customers wanted, not just what was easy to produce. This change meant that marketing was finally getting the attention it deserved, but it also added more responsibility to marketing professionals.
Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, and since about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising, the pressure was on advertising people. The 1980s were great for advertising, but the 1990s started with a big downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because companies began to question the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money.
Client companies wanted better strategies, creativity, and media placement from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce great work. This meant that advertising professionals had to find ways to do more with less, just like their clients.
Other challenges made advertising difficult, such as changes in population, the power of retailers, changing consumer needs, more legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising in other countries. These issues forced advertising professionals to think about how to make more of their advertising effective.
Help for advertising professionals was hard to find. Companies and agencies were too busy dealing with these challenges to share their strategies. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often didn't provide practical advice. They sometimes made it seem like all advertising was high quality and good value, which wasn't always true."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job. Chefs have difficult lives: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But this did not stop me. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard, and the social life was not enjoyable. Being a chef seemed like a good change. It offered seriousness and honesty that I did not find in college. My wish to cook was not just because I was a student. It was also about a love for beauty. I first felt this when I ate at a famous London restaurant. The meal was amazing. I still remember my starter. After the meal, I wanted to thank the chef. I felt happy for days. After this, I wanted to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life to prepare for a career in cooking. My history degree felt empty and distracted me from my real goal. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making fancy meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and strong, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict and always corrected me: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes!' The next week, I went to the high board. It was very high, and I was scared. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt calm. I moved my arms as I was taught, tried to look up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I did not dive well, and my legs went everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, 'That's what they mean by ""free as a bird"".'
**The Traveller**
For those of us who like a comfortable bed and running water, the idea of a traveller is strange but interesting. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone in rough seas. They might eat insects if there is no other food and live in the unknown for months. It is easy to think of them as unusual, like hermits or writers. They live in a world different from ours, which we can ignore. We can return to our safe world with microwaves and phones, where the biggest risk is crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is why he spends a lot of time on it. He does not say he is a great sailor, but he is good at it. He sails because he likes to write about it. Sailing gives him exciting stories to tell. Raban's boat has a device that shows his exact location anywhere on Earth. He likes this tool, but he has mixed feelings about other sailing aids. He thinks the compass changed how people relate to the sea. Before the compass, sailors had to watch the waves and feel the sea. Now, the ocean is just a space to cross. The helmsman can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods. This might be why Raban has time to look closely at the waves."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or far away. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us. They express our thoughts clearly, which we might struggle to do. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves. Reading and travel help us escape our daily routines. Our eyes are most open when we are in a new place or reading a great book. Books help us notice things we ignored before. We become aware of the sky's colors, a friend's behavior, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were first published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes, but not many. I corrected a few mistakes, but only small details. I did not rewrite the articles to predict future events. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. I wrote the article based on what I knew at the time. The real story of travel is about people exploring the world with just a ticket. I believe that even simple postcards can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to avoid harming the places they visited. 'Ecotourism' became a popular marketing term. Now, it includes anything from living with remote tribes to short boat trips. Any tour with cultural interaction, nature, or adventure is called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, travelers often feel lost in the ecotourism world.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in welcoming homes for weeks. When I stopped traveling, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only made short notes. I worried about the order of events when writing this book, but then decided it didn't matter. I let the story tell itself without too many explanations."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the growth of business in the 1800s and 1900s. However, many fashion historians say that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the market and trade growth in the 1500s and 1600s. As societies have become more complex, and as more types of clothing and accessories have been made, the meanings of clothes have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can mean different things in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Newspaper stories about publishers fighting over new books give a wrong idea of what life is like for most writers. For those of us not on the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smart ones write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs, so they are safe even if their book is not a hit. People like me, however, do different small jobs, like teaching, workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I never got anything like that. Somehow, by doing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often with help from friends, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places we were playing at around the country started to sell out, and extra security was needed to control the growing number of screaming girls. We had to use secret entrances to the halls and ballrooms to avoid being mobbed by fans. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by followers. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I felt a strange confidence that only shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Challenges**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music performances and jobs for musicians. Music is important for many reasons. It is part of big national events and personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn instruments.
The music industry is important for Britain's economy. Musical skills will still be needed for jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA shows that music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. In Europe, group music lessons have helped with social skills and concentration in children. Playing an instrument might also help develop skills like good study habits and organization. Because of these benefits, people will still want to learn instruments in the short term.
In the long term, music might change in two ways. First, people will listen to more types of music. New styles will mix different genres. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music. This will make composing music easier but might reduce the need for live performances. More people of all ages might want to make music in their communities, reflecting their traditions.
To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. The way we teach and assess music will need to adapt. Musicians will need to inspire and teach people of all ages and work with large groups. They will also need skills in communication, social interaction, and management for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods. It is also important to show the value of music education.
Finally, we need to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is crucial, but often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes people make fun of actors. This often happens because actors talk about their work in interviews. They should answer like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" But instead, actors often use boring phrases or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when they are performing. Talking about it makes it seem empty. Acting has no strict rules, except maybe being loud enough. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's ideas. When a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next one. This emptiness is clear when discussing theatre work.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as someone between a boy and a man. His performance is simple yet exciting. He handles the text well and shows great control, making him a top actor. Lester plays a young man full of hidden anger, who is smart and funny, making him both strong and likable. His performance is very skilled, even if it seems understated. Watch how Lester's body moves, like he is waiting to come alive. Handy, who plays Horatio, gives a similar feeling. This raises questions about acting and behavior. Is acting just copying real life, or is it something more? Who or what brings these characters to life? This is a key question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors sit quietly, listening to others speak and feeling the words' effects. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, think about the words, and wait for the urge to speak. For example, if the line is ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought come, and imagine a scene. They find the reason to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or inside. They look at the other actor and think about their character's situation. The director says ""dropping in"" helps discover what's happening. Don't plan too much. Go in with an open mind and trust something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre makes you feel your presence matters. Going to a live performance is special, and the staff should feel this too. It's not good if it seems like just another job for them. The theatre should connect the performer and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well and feel involved. The size of the theatre is important. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it doesn't work well because drama is about people. Many theatres from the late 1800s got it right by making spaces that fit the stage. I like theatres with a sense of history, like old stone steps in a church. You can't please everyone with plays. You can't guess what the audience wants because they don't know either. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising, or you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular with young people. However, it also had a big impact on middle-class and older people. It helped create the next group of rock stars. These young musicians listened to rock and roll and felt it was important to their future. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting new music was on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was very important for many future rock stars. Like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to making his own.
**Snow Adventure**
There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I fell through a thin layer. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what I would do if the hole had been deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.
**Understanding Qualitative Research**
There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. These books often talk about how to collect data but not much about how to analyze it. Many people find data analysis mysterious. So, we asked different social scientists to talk about how they analyze their data. The goal was to share ideas and understanding about data analysis, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden processes more clear. Although this sounds easy, it is not. We let our contributors present their work in different styles, like personal stories or more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show he watched recently. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, and he didn't remember much. Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these new people. But in the end, they accepted it because of success, which is very important in America. Success in Hollywood means making a lot of money at the box office. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: a film that might make a star, but must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in a way, it is still like a village - small and focused on one thing - films. People there talk about how much films have made, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: they work there but live somewhere else. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.
**Photography**
Photography was invented by artists in the nineteenth century as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images that were more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists, and after their first excitement about the new images, art critics said photography was not art. They believed that because photography depended on machines, it couldn't be a creative act. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists used brushes and pencils - to show their vision of the world and the people in it.
**Book Illustration**
During the time when book illustrations were in black and white, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also included many novels for older readers, although this became less common as time went on. Children's publishing was very active, but it was often done on a low budget, which led to a lot of average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of ordinary and great work, a great place for research or browsing. The real treasures will come back to public attention, either through reissues of books or new publications about the artists. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and the process of appreciating this artistic period is underway. An enterprising publisher might see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either in reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"'Blogging: Sharing with the World Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of public check-ins - telling everyone online where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, 'Hey, I'm here' - but you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This made people realize that sharing too much online can be risky. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering dreams of wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we find out that the internet can be dangerous and confusing. Is this sad? Maybe, but don't lose hope. There is a guide for this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the problems of being famous - all before social media existed. These early users, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. If we don't learn from history, we might repeat it. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the 'WWW', as it was called then. The web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few young people like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people came to see a young man exploring this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. It was the work of someone who liked attention, but it also had a beauty that some might call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it gone, replaced by a video called Dark Night. His story came out; he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He had shared his life online, and Hall said, 'it makes people not trust me'. The blog ended, but the problem remains. Sharing online is fun. But if you think it will make people like you, you might be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Sometimes, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to all the vice presidents at her company - including some she had made fun of - and she lost her job. People who study online behavior have a term for this. They call it the 'online distribution effect': the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online lives are connected to our real lives. If we forget this, we can make big mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. She was upset and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started her blog again, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful 'mommy blogger' and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned something important: the web lets us say anything, but that doesn't mean we should.'"
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and rich countries, more people have trouble sleeping and feel anxious. In the USA, 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books talk about people who can't sleep or about sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, why we need it, and what happens when we can't sleep. A main idea is that people need more sleep. A sleep expert says, ""People sleep less when they are busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.""
A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to sleep about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting.
In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and how dangerous it is to drive when tired. They find volunteers in student newspapers. Volunteers are paid and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put electrodes on their heads, but they only study physical things.
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Volunteers come at 2 pm, after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many say they won't fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one who does. At first, he is alert, but then he starts blinking and nodding off. The car goes off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for a short time. She suggests tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum for shift workers.
What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans sleep in cycles like other animals. There are four stages of sleep, from light to deep. Dreams happen in light sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injury. Scientists know women sleep half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850, people in Britain went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poor enjoyed this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours, changing sleep patterns for everyone except some country people.
Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some places, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for danger make continuous sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"'We are talking about big boots here. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. It wasn't working. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I was not at home. I flew in from Denver just after dawn and thought I might look like a cowboy. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a dirty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a dirty bag. He saw my new cowboy boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without looking back. 
I wished there was an outfit for an ex-racing driver that made me feel normal. Something to wear so I wouldn't feel like I was from another planet. I loved being a racing driver. I am addicted to it, and it's all I know. But I don't do it anymore. I can't, even if I wanted to. I looked at the mountains and thought, what do I do now? A racing driver should have other plans for when he stops racing. I thought I did, but they disappeared. 
How about being a commentator at the racetrack? 'We have fifteen former drivers in line for that job. We'll call you.' Or maybe selling classic cars? That idea lasted almost all winter with meetings and phone calls. But nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealers. So I left before there was nothing left. Being an 'ex' anything is hard. How much do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. Even if I was the champion, you would only listen for five minutes. Last year's champion is last year. I don't want sympathy, and I don't get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and kept enough. But I miss driving those fast cars. Zero to one hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. I miss the danger and the people who cared about what I said. Being famous, even a little, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Little boys wanted my autograph. Now that I don't drive, the phone rings only twice a week. I have a lot of free time. 
I looked at the blue sky. No buzzards. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But some small birds in a cactus were singing. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in designer boots has a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people like to walk down the city streets. If you walk with them, you will probably hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and the mountains, clean and safe environment, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about the many new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Even though the name is not used much now, Vancouver is still a gateway.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists, like me, are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we try hard to make our writing have a big impact, so writing a simple letter feels difficult. Real artists, who don't focus on the effect of their words (even if they rewrite a lot), don't have this problem. I think a real artist knows how to use words effectively. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that famous people are not needed. Why pay a celebrity when anyone can open it for free? Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy store didn't care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel happy and those who came later feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941, there was a lot of talk about it. Its release was delayed because the distributor was afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who the film was supposedly about, might do. Even though the reviews were mostly very positive, the film did not make much money. It was television that made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most inspiring film for people who want to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film was successful because he didn't know what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a film about a newspaper owner who was like Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor. He took the opportunity with great energy.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped at the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head both times, but it seemed like she wasn't really listening. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And like I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.
**Title Race**
Tea boy? No, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.
Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would rather have a better job title than a pay raise. If our desire for fancy titles is stronger than our desire for more money, we are in trouble. Today, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. Taking photos was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how one picture could show the true feeling of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo. As long as I had film in my camera, I kept looking for that moment. Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well that became famous. It was on the cover of Time magazine. After that, I became a freelance photographer. But things didn't go as well as I hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. Still, I was happy to be taking photos and getting paid for it. I got the Vienna job by chance. I had taken photos of London for a book called Four Cities in Four Seasons. The book also included Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the job in Vienna, so they asked me to take his place. I was free, and they liked my work. I was glad to go because things at home weren't good. I stayed at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in January, it was different. I felt excited as soon as I arrived. The first day, I just rode the trams around the city to feel its mood. I hadn't seen Schussner's photos from other seasons. I wanted to make my own Vienna. A photo captures a moment, and I waited for the right moment. The next morning, I went out early. Snow had fallen, and Stephansplatz was white and empty. The cathedral was hard to capture in one photo because it was so big. But in that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always seemed magical to me. Even when you know how it works, it still feels mysterious. That's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't really surprise me.'"
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**
Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place full of wonder, not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves or explores movement has been an important, but often unnoticed, part of art in the 20th century. The exhibition includes paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, collected by curator Guy Brett, who has studied this art form for a long time. There are not many explanations, so visitors can enjoy discovering things on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art is popular with many people, even those who usually do not like art. People might like his work because it is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing scenes. Some people might be interested in Hockney himself because he is funny and interesting. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist, but others argue that he might seem less important because he is so popular. Hockney knows his limits and does not claim to be a great artist. He believes only time will tell how important his work is.
**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**
Recently, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some good and some not so good. I do not like shows that try to push a certain idea or trend. As a curator, I wanted to create an exhibition that was different. I worked with seven artists to use a space in an empty warehouse. The exhibition, called 'Window-shopping,' was a collection of individual artworks that were only connected because they were all art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera work flickered on a monitor. These works did not fit into a specific theme, but they worked well together. I did not make any big statements about contemporary art, but I believe art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who love paintings sometimes do not want to analyze them because they think it will ruin their experience. Some say that art historians focus too much on theory and forget the joy of looking at art. This is like saying that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. Understanding more about art can actually make it more enjoyable. Our enjoyment of art is influenced by our society and its values. While it is important to enjoy art instinctively, thinking about art does not take away from this enjoyment."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for a fish or just relaxing. One of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It didn't feel like a normal stone, but it was pretty. This is how gold might have become important to early people. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it quickly became popular. Copper might have been found by accident too. Once people saw how useful copper tools were, they looked for copper ores and ways to get copper from them. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.
**St Ives**
We were quiet as we carried our bags down the winding, cobbled street to the center of town. We bent over against the strong wind and tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and the windows in every house by the water were shut tight against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. As the dark grey skies came in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn't seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and hard times are long dead. The reasons they moved or stayed, and how they formed families and cities, are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. But maybe we can. Computer modelling lets us recreate old landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change things like rainfall or population to see how this digital culture reacts."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male saw a strange male monkey in nearby trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To stop this, the dominant male used a clever trick. When the stranger tried to cross the open ground to join the group, the dominant male gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. The stranger quickly returned to the trees. This happened several times during the day. However, the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the leopard alarm call while he was calmly walking across the open ground himself.
**What Cats Catch**
In the English village of Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw these numbers and estimated that cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide places for birds to nest, keeping bird numbers high. The survey showed that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly and with groans. They move towards the reed beds beyond the open water. They stand on the edge of the platform, complaining about the hard day ahead. Finally, the leader steps into the water, and the others follow. In the water, they seem to forget their plans and stay there for a while. Eventually, they start swimming, looking tired and almost drowning. They spend the day among the reeds, eating green shoots at their eye level.
**PICASSO, Pablo**
In 1940, Picasso painted several fish still lifes while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The fish and crab look alive. Picasso used overlapping and interlocking transparent shapes, giving the painting a calm, underwater feel. However, there is tension in the painting. The fish show their teeth, and the crab has open claws, suggesting a fight. The sharp shapes and the chain around one fish add a sense of danger. This gives the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography
In the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown in its ability to show moments in time and space. It lets us see quick moments and both big and small things. Photography has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth and in space, as well as the complex and difficult parts of modern life. It is a powerful way to show what it means to be human.
However, using pictures to record events is not new. The first pictures go back to about 35,000 years ago in the Upper Palaeolithic period. We do not know exactly why early cave paintings were made. They might show real hunting events, be used for magic to help with hunting, serve as religious symbols, or simply make living spaces more interesting. But pictures have always been a part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate pictures are and their importance in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given pictures a special place. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record. The camera, like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we see. This was a big achievement, as artists had worked for centuries to create such images by hand.
Because cameras seemed so real, people thought everyone could understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said even a person living far away could understand a photo of the sky. But with the growth of global communication in the late 1900s, we need to ask if photos can really be understood across different cultures. Is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Are we so used to photos that we overlook the skill needed to create them?
Photography is often seen as clear evidence, making it hard to tell the difference between real life and photos. It is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming part of history. Photos now tell us about the people and society that made them, not just the subject in the picture.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography can inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 1400s was influenced by new ways of showing perspective in art. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the tough realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a field with hidden dangers. You need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can cause problems. It's risky to act like you know everything, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination and spirit be free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem, while others write to escape sadness. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are correct, as long as they are not just copying others. It's important to find your own voice, listen to it, nurture it, and let it grow. One day, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary. A good way to use flashbacks is through a memory in the main character's mind. This memory can help move the story forward but should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a question quickly. It also keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it should not be so short that it feels like a summary. A short story needs conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must be important.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players don't know much, but they know enough to play. They make moves without knowing what will happen next. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. They notice patterns, like openings and endings. The more you play chess, the more you understand its complexities. The same is true for writing screenplays.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, but they don't naturally write. Language is found in all societies, but writing is not. Languages change but don't get better. English today is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children don't have a language, they create one. Writing, however, was invented only a few times in history and improved slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write. Even today, many struggle. Children are naturally good at speaking, but writing is a skill that must be learned. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it to children."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I only want to write what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story made-up names, and I have tried to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong and kind character will influence others, and people will realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, with its limits, will be a useful source of information for my friend's biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I have written are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words in the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I have done this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book interesting. The smart reader will see where I have used this trick, and he can choose to ignore it. Another reason I am worried about this work is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not only themselves; they are also the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you have to live them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters briefly. You give the reader a general idea and let him imagine the details. In this book, I don't pretend that my characters see themselves as I see them; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see the patterns and importance of different writers. Today, there are many different styles of poetry, ways of presenting it, and ideas about the poet's role in society. Generally, there is a debate between two groups: 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their poems in front of an audience. This division is not strict, and public poetry readings have become more common in the last twenty years. These readings happen in many places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals.
For 'pop' poets, who write their poems to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand when heard. However, on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique can be seen. On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, trying to include deep passion, thought, and rhythm, may not be appreciated by an audience hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that they might choose to read only their simpler work to connect quickly with the audience.
Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm of the poems. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or know the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make people associate poetry with enjoyment, not just something for a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are using more oral evidence, but it has challenges. It's not simple to think that someone's story is a perfect picture of the past. In an interview, both the historian and the person telling the story affect each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence changes how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is influenced by the historian's position and how they understand history. Historians help create new evidence, so they must be careful. Also, the person telling the story is not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with other information, like from the media, or changed by feelings like nostalgia or later life experiences. These feelings can make the story seem convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animal science: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body works, like nerves and muscles. The whole animal approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually study learning in animals like rats and pigeons in labs. Ethologists study natural behavior in wild animals. Although these fields are different, they are now working together more. Physiologists believe their methods are more basic, but understanding behavior also needs studying it as a whole. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
Students studying social science for the first time face a challenge. They need to learn both the content and the methods of the subject. This means understanding the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. Social sciences might seem like common sense because we all live in society, but they go beyond that. Each social science focuses on a specific part of social life, uses special methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts are the basic ideas that help social scientists go beyond common sense and make each discipline unique.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek words for some of these ideas, showing they came from earlier Greek sources. Utility and function were not part of his main definition, though he did talk about the best designs for different uses. The focus was on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. Before it, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These simple forms still influenced later architecture. Despite its appearance, a classical temple is basically a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,C2,"
The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, railway line, and gasworks. She once made a mistake by jumping a small bridge, but Chen found it amusing when he found out. He was happy about Lily's new skill and planned a trip with her. They chose a Monday at the start of next month, a quiet day, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose customers. Lily practiced driving around the allotments in the meantime.
Mui, despite her worries, bought a road map and got a discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills. An hour after leaving home, they reached the English Channel. Lily drove very well, even overtaking some slow cars. Chen applauded her. They drove through a seaside town and parked near the sea. Lily was unsure about the road markings, so she paid for parking to avoid trouble.
Lily locked the van doors carefully. Chen joked that no one would steal the van, which upset the sisters. Chen then took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. He decided to give Man Kee a good education and hoped he would own many restaurants one day. The sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future.
Chen saw a ship through a telescope and showed it to Man Kee, saying it was special and would take them home one day. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily tried to see the ship through the telescope, but it was gone by then. She only saw seagulls in the distance."
CPE_43,C2,"**The Well**
I had read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I convinced you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough. You held the handle, but when I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. I saw strange lights, like stars in cartoons when characters get hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back, but you called again, sounding scared, and I stayed quiet. I watched you through my eyelashes. You ran to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I saw the wet trail I left from the well to where I hid. I was scared they would see it. Father shone a flashlight into the well. I couldn't believe no one noticed the water drops. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I realized my prank had gone too far and could lead to serious trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. I decided to act like I had just escaped. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and tired. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after me, so no one could check. Father looked at me with disbelief. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me with pity, seeing through my lie. His look made me feel ashamed, realizing the seriousness of my actions."

**MOVING DAY**
Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it. Fred, the removal man, and his team were packing everything from the house into boxes. Fred was careful with the fragile items, but his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house that overlooked a small harbour. She remembered the years spent there with her children growing up.
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was an adult and was helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping. She was very particular about the Steinway piano, insisting that only she could handle it properly.
Fred noticed that Susan wasn't crying. He said many people cry when they see their house being emptied. Susan could understand why. She remembered when they first moved in, and the piano got stuck on the stairs. It took a long time to get it inside. Her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to lift the piano into the house.
Now, Susan was worried about the piano again. The banister rails were still not perfect from the last move. She thought she should have warned the movers, but it was too late. Fred reassured her that they just had the piano left to move. Susan was nervous, but Robert and Francesca were there to support her.
As the piano was moved down the stairs, Susan felt emotional. She realized how much the things in the house meant to her now that they were being moved. But when the piano was safely outside, Robert started laughing, and soon all three of them were laughing together. They walked down the path arm in arm, and the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Book Reviews: Fun for Everyone?**
When the Internet started, the idea was that anyone could share their thoughts online. In the beginning, you needed some technical skills to do this. But one area that became open to everyone was book reviews. Amazon.com, the first big online bookstore, allowed anyone to write a review for a book. People could rate books from one to five stars and share their opinions. This was great because it let buyers see what other readers thought, not just what publishers or professional critics said.
Amazon was the biggest online bookstore, with over 80% of the market. It had many reviews, but this also led to some problems. Many reviews were submitted every day, so it was hard to check them all. Amazon had rules: no single-word reviews, no personal attacks, no spoilers, and no bad language. But since reviewers were anonymous, some people broke the rules. For example, some authors wrote fake positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, did this until he admitted it in an article, and then Amazon removed his fake reviews.
Authors could also comment on their own books through a special link. Most authors used this to encourage people to buy their books. However, Amazon did not always check if the comments really came from the authors, except for famous writers. For example, a fake comment pretending to be from the famous author John Updike was removed.
Sometimes, readers used reviews to express their anger. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, some people in the book felt upset and wrote negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days.
Despite these issues, Amazon liked that people spent time writing reviews because it was good for business. They watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were more common on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired a funny review that compared the book to Internet technology.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious and gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books could be boring. But with everyone able to write reviews, it made the process more interesting and fair."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people often think that every artist must be different from others. Art is admired for being unique, new, or even shocking. We like to praise artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to today's art, we sometimes feel unsure and say an artist has gone too far, that it is not art anymore. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be new and different. We forget that today's art also has old themes and methods. We think artists should be special and different from us, with talents that cannot be controlled by rules. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and it was part of everyday life. Today, we let artists do what they want and get upset if they try to be more like us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June
Usually, when a painter finds success in one style, they stick to it. Collectors expect this, and trying something new can upset people. Gallery owners like safe choices, and the public likes things to stay the same. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, change styles and succeed. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He has always liked railways and started drawing them in the 1980s. His new show, ""Underground Encounters,"" has 40 paintings and drawings showing the magic of the underground world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would come to such a remote place to heal. I am here to heal myself. Apart from an old woman who comes to clean the house, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in memories. I talked about how art seems useless but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of my work is that in the quiet of painting or writing, reality can be changed and shown in a new way. Our everyday actions hide the true meaning of life. For artists, art is a way to deal with what hurts us in life, not to avoid it, but to fulfill it with imagination. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. He talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I guessed what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. He usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand a lot of information quickly, you talk well, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see in TV dramas.""
""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other careers open to me, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""
My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need.
That was not all. As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he worked, the dynamic energy, the perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which was not ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency with a higher salary of thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted a better address for their social status. 
To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where his grandmother took care of everything so his grandfather could relax after work. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as Simon's. They needed both salaries to maintain their lifestyle.
Now, their situation was at risk because of Venetia. She came to their office very upset, accusing Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a past case. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied everything, but his denial seemed weak even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered being punished as a child. He wished he had been prepared and said something different. Venetia's anger and disgust confused him. He wondered why she was so upset and if she had the right to ruin his career. If the rumors spread, he knew his career would be over."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous here. I believed people wouldn't care if the houses were old and the gardens were messy. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to forget about summer, but tonight, I am watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I have cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She writes books that haven't been published, and sometimes I have to pretend to like them because I am an English teacher. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she replies. Then she says, 'I'll bring something to drink.' I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I see now that it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in a chair. 'Cheers,' she adds, 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. 
I feel worried about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and feeling lonely on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, feeling nervous. 'Of course,' Jaz says. 'If I'm around,' knowing she will be. 'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning her manuscripts. I decide to be honest. 'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks, upset. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: less about yourself, more fiction...' 'Teachers!' Jaz says, like a student unhappy with a grade. 'I keep a journal,' I say, 'where I write something good about each day.' My words sound old-fashioned. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 
Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes and come home, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and their stories. But there is also a need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel part of history. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture from past generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. But now, because of changes in society, many of these stories are lost. Instead, places and buildings help us remember the past. It is important to protect these links to honor our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner, wrote about a place I have no personal connection with. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good setting for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not really flat or empty. They are as English as any other place but also very unique and mysterious. It is interesting that in the middle of England, there is a place that feels foreign to many English people. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open and mysterious. While writing, I did not visit many places in the Fens. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine places rather than rely on facts. The Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels. Now, displays should be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide boxes of objects for teachers to use in class or for helping elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real items, not replicas. They show things that existed and had meaning in history. This is what makes them different from heritage centers and theme parks. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by making people want to see the real things.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but now changes in our towns happen quickly and affect many people. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the future of towns. People who have lived through big events like world wars may care more about preserving things because they value stability. If there is a need to preserve, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, like our population, welfare, and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell smart products, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem different from everyday life. Einstein was part of a big change in science, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying matter and natural forces. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people believed in Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I didn't like prize-winning books because we thought they would be boring. Our mother didn't like this attitude, but our father would give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also give us better books as gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. We often thought these were 'boys' books', but sometimes we found some good short stories and once, a famous book of poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that the origin of human language is a wonderful mystery. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were in danger. This sound is sad, and people in dangerous places made desperate noises. Some words today, like malaria (meaning ""fever"") or the Latin mors (meaning ""death""), might come from these sounds. Because of these strange ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for odd thinkers. But now, the origin and evolution of language are important research areas. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, even though philosopher John Locke said language was a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from a writer's point of view. Most reviews are written quickly and don't last long. They have deadlines and are usually short. Once published, they are only read for a short time, like a day or a week. People often think that writing reviews is not important work. Many writers do it because they need money or because they can't work on their big projects all the time. However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It's different to write a short review for a newspaper than a long one for an international journal. Reviewers also need to think about who will read their reviews, from casual readers to those very interested in the topic. A good reviewer knows a lot about many things and can write clearly and enjoyably. Reviewers often write other things too. For example, the American novelist John Updike writes reviews between writing his novels. He collects his reviews into books, even if they are short. Some people think only famous writers should keep their reviews, but others believe anyone can if they think their reviews are good. I feel this way about my own work. I am mainly an academic, and my serious books are academic. In the English-speaking world, it's common for people to both review and study literature. In the past, some academics didn't like professors writing reviews, but now it's more accepted. There is more reviewing work now, so many people can do it. I think this is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It's also good for professors because it helps them communicate better with non-professors. In the end, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, quiet hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a little unsure about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, often as early as possible, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or a blinking light on the answering machine when he returned. He was glad the windows hadn't been broken or the flat damaged, but he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the office and started his bus ride home, he felt more like himself and didn't need to be alone anymore, though he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his things, but once home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that working in a job he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now he wondered why he did these things. His thoughts and feelings seemed unclear and disconnected. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own worth. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends and followed their paths, not imagining he could find a job that would make him happy. He went to one interview and didn't think much about the job itself, which was an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was just happy to have a nice conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would have later. Neil offered him the job right away, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I moved through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A part of the area was marked off for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch the goats. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they like to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I thought about the night ahead and felt scared. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were low. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley said she saw a light, and we felt hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see it. Time seemed to stop, and we kept moving.
**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and shareholders. How can I get better at presentations and feel more confident?
You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues to think of difficult questions the audience might ask. Also, start with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They need their own time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly to mayonnaise, it will curdle. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things it does very fast, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But some things cannot be rushed. If we try, they will fail, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line. Sometimes, trying to think fast is not helpful, like trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three different speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted quickly to keep me safe. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also reacts quickly. This fast intelligence is called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself, which involves figuring things out and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine or a student working on an assignment uses this kind of intelligence, called ""intellect."" Someone good at this is called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is a slower way of thinking. It is less clear and more relaxed. When we are lost in thought by the sea or just waking up, we are in this mode. This slow way of thinking is just as important as the faster ones. Thinking slowly is important, especially when life is busy. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Recent studies show that slow thinking is good for complex situations. Fast thinking works well when the problem is clear. But when we don't know what to consider, we need the slow mind. If the problem is managing a difficult group at work or changing careers, it is better to think slowly. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long known the limits of fast thinking. Scientists are now studying slow thinking. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can do many important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than fast thinking."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It's a friendly and well-supplied base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My school-level French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure about which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, anxious like I was in the first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not because of missing company or communication, but because I have lost the social advantage that my ability to talk has always given me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him again, he shook hands with me warmly, but didn't try to become friends. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, people from different countries should react the same way. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with guesses or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy over the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, you can buy many types of telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can stay in the sky for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the newest product or service. Technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. People are now looking for 'simplexity' - simple things that give meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and now it is very important to us. Nothing can change this ritual. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the bad manners of shop assistants today, and I do not like waiters who try to be too friendly. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for privacy is rare in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
A special version of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a review I wrote when the show first started last spring. I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still think it's not right to ignore the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but I was wrong about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The whole cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include Cassio's games with other officers that become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The pace and tension are great throughout. Don't miss this show.
**Lake Vostok**
In the middle of Antarctica, there is no movement. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except in a huge hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, at the coldest place on earth. The water has been without air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting topic on the radio last week. It seems that some scientists are very excited about what makes them want to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the old search for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know if what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the important thing is not why we do science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Our relationship with food is very important and satisfying. Many people think cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by just putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs into water. This is much better than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with preservatives, you can make a tasty dessert in five minutes that everyone will love. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important in our lives, which is why we celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other events around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were stuffed in drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She was always punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had vandalized the office. He could pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her with hope, but she wasn't interested in cleaning his office. She only took care of his apartment, which was her responsibility. Mrs. Wilson thought of him as someone from another world, not from her familiar Brooklyn streets.
**KAREN**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story of strength. A key moment was when she was twelve, and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the doctor said the bone protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles, she felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking across the village green, feeling both excited and sad. She had just learned something important, which was exciting in her quiet life. But she was also very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years and helped her with her yearly throat problems. She appreciated how he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"Joanna's Lessons
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. But she also writes books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is known for her amazing piano skills. She plays many styles of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it, making the boy happy.
Joanna is different from many top pianists because she cares about how children learn the piano. She has written a piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" She did this even though she has a very busy schedule. She is involved in many music festivals and runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She also likes to work with other artists.
Joanna believes the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks music should be for everyone, not just for those who want to be great musicians. She grew up with many children learning different types of music at her home, where her mother taught piano. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.
Some children learn piano quickly, but Joanna is interested in those who take their time. Many children stop learning because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations. Joanna wants music to be fun and enjoyable, not just about achieving goals.
Joanna's books are colorful and have stories to make learning fun. They come with CDs that have music for children to play along with. She believes learning should be fun and encourages children to improvise and explore the piano.
As children progress, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. Joanna understands this because she also relied on her ear when she was young. She believes practice is very important. She didn't practice much until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she learned difficult music that required practice. Now, she practices eight hours a day and finds it very important.
Joanna says the key to practice is knowing what you want to achieve. She suggests playing the whole piece, even with mistakes, and mixing hard and easy pieces."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is often difficult to create. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there are not many mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard work. Writing slowly helps the brain to think carefully. When it is hard to change or erase something, we write with more care. Using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing their computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Also, emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. Some people say emails have brought back the art of love letters. Many love emails are sent now, where before there was only small talk. This is good because at least these emails are written in some form of English. But words on a screen can feel boring. People who write on computers often do not understand the power of words and can exaggerate. Words written quickly on a computer lack the care and character of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed and gave the disc to him carefully. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi. He pressed a button, and a small drawer came out. He put the disc in and pressed the button again, and the drawer went back in. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused, then thoughtful. ""I don't know. You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my chair. ""Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches were invented after lighters, we would think they were better. Many people say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. For example, a book from 1979 said that books would start to disappear in the 1980s. This was not true. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so most people don't do it. Computers make it easy to read small parts of text. Some people say this leads to new ways of storytelling. But reading parts of a text is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. What is new is that computers do not encourage reading a whole text.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything in perfect order. The carpet was clear, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen tried to close the filing cabinet and then spoke to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He did not think about computers or any other machines, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he knew her, they had this conversation many times. She could not understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even written an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. She could use a keyboard to change any software into something new."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She usually forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that if he stayed away, things would go wrong. He thought about how he went from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to someone always trying to prevent problems, with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, and Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from friends. Ian was proof that friends can be unreliable. Lancelot skipped the introduction and read the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and put it aside. It seemed Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt like it had no real conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death. The author was paid chapter by chapter. But Ian had already received a large advance. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre quickly, but Ian seemed even more talented. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he knew them. But Ian's talent stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian became more difficult. He was chosen to edit an arts magazine but never published it. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little except stories about his high salary. At meetings, Ian criticized others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to admit that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"'England's breakfast change The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts. However, breakfast is quite new in England's history. In medieval times, breakfast was not common. There are some mentions of travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became normal for everyone. Some say this was because there was more food available. But they might not have thought about other big social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working for set hours, often very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary and was not just for the rich.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and cultural norms. In this book, we will see how these factors affect the style and meaning of a photo, and how people react to it. For example, when we look at a photo in a newspaper, we might think about whether it shows the scene as it really was or if it shows the photographer's opinion. Is the exact moment important, or is the photo a symbol of something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just a game. The best people in sport believe in themselves completely. You need to focus if you want to succeed. There is only one way to be the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's all or nothing. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but also how to work as part of a team. My sport lets you shine individually, but it's also a team game, and you need to balance both. It's like life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened doors and shown me things around the world that others may never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences stay very clear in our memory. For me, one such moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To understand the bird's song, I thought about my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird's performance was like an amazing improvisation. I reacted with surprise and joy as each new musical variation came through the window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 
In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is hitting the glass. Wrens are seen as special birds in British culture. In the past, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their future luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens are still loved. A forest without wrens feels empty. 
This connection with birds comes from old stories and beliefs. For example, in the 1500s, red kites were common in London and were seen as helpful birds. Later, they were seen as pests and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, they are protected and are a symbol of conservation in Britain.
Our connection with birds is deep and goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds to learn about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which are important to us. Some people think these feelings are old and not needed now, but they are still part of us. 
Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad because it means losing cultural symbols too. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have special meanings in literature and folklore. Their loss is felt deeply. 
Folklore is important because it keeps stories and feelings about birds alive. These stories connect us to the past and help us understand our feelings about birds. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the excitement we feel is hard to explain with science. Birds are fascinating, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their messages. The wren in the greenhouse is a mystery that connects the past, present, and future."
CPE_28,C2,"'Maps The purpose of a map is to show how places and features on the earth relate to each other. This is done using distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like 'a day's walk' or 'a few hours by river'. This told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The way maps were made depended on their purpose and where they were made. To understand old maps, it is important to know the conventions used at that time. The history of map-making is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details to maps. Map-making has used other sciences to help. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass. Instruments were created to measure angles accurately. As people explored more, they tried to map the world. Astronomers found that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but slightly flat at the poles, which changed how large areas were mapped. Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Soldiers needed accurate maps for planning battles, especially with the use of artillery. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also had their own needs. Modern map-makers have developed ways to map things like geological layers, climate, and land use. Today, maps are important for understanding many scientific phenomena, leading to a modern revival in map-making. However, the progress in map-making has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid development. Sometimes old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Map-makers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since it was easy to copy old maps, publishers were sometimes slow to accept new ideas. Therefore, maps should not always be seen as accurate evidence of what people knew at the time. The many maps we have today show a lot of human effort and thought. They are a valuable record for studying human history. This makes the study of historical maps both interesting and educational.'"
CPE_35,C2,"
I was invited into a young man's living room. It was a nice and organized space, unlike the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, and the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across. It was surprising to see a teenager who spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. 
My own dreams were just as crazy. I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me. But when Andrew suggested I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I decided to give it a try. This was because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed. I could tell he was very good. He played more music from shows he had written at school, reminding me of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and a single song I had written that an unknown pop group had recorded. We promised to meet again and write something together. 
I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I knew I had met someone with rare talent and determination. I thought it would be a mistake not to work with him. Even if we didn't succeed in musical theater, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The next day, back at my desk where I was training to become a lawyer, my excitement about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for groups needing a vocalist and write simple songs, but it seemed likely I would become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. My father predicted I would grow out of pop music by the time I was twenty-one, which worried me. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to write musical lyrics instead of pop songs. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football team. 
I wasn't convinced by the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was clear, and he said he had all the contacts. I soon returned to his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. His story was worthy, but it didn't excite me. The hero was too perfect, and the project was not original, similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar, there's room for two. We could be the second one. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which his previous lyricist had thought of. I skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important in our lives that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders did not learn web-spinning from a teacher, and they do not need special skills to do it.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, created by the air around us, greatly affect where animals and plants live. Climate can change the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow, which have many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which make up the climate over time, happen because large masses of air rise and mix. The atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the earth spins, and the air does not move as fast as the earth. The sun is another important reason for air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee and how to clean the espresso machine. I also learned how to make a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee was not easy, and I thought I might be given simpler tasks. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He said, 'Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it.'"
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be easy for the camera to show. The camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in to see details. But there are few TV series that show both the joy and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on great artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a risk-taker. Metals are less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a big part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, free-trade economists who said the market would keep metal prices high have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are going down. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. These islands stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own personality and offers something special. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"'Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
The Bamboo Bike Club, started by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a course where you can build your own bamboo bike. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the UK's only bamboo bike-building workshop. The course includes a custom-designed bike frame and a fun weekend of building.
Bamboo is becoming popular in bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have brought back this method, first used in 1894. However, their bikes are expensive, with frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for everyone. They spent years developing their idea in a shed in Wales. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell frames.
The Bamboo Bike Club is more like a community project. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so they run the club alongside their full-time jobs. Their courses are popular and affordable, offering a custom bike frame and a weekend of building.
On the first day, participants learn to choose bamboo for strength and make strong joints. The frame starts with the front triangle, then the seat and chain assembly. Metal tubes are used for parts needing extra strength, like handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian help with every step, ensuring quality.
Building the bike is part of the fun, especially for engineers. Mistakes are okay; you can try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece is checked for quality, and you can choose the look of your frame.
On Sunday, participants build the lugs using hemp bindings and epoxy resin for strong joints. A final coating makes the bike waterproof. The finished bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. It's as strong as metal bikes. Ian has used his for a year on a long commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months.
Bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they are unique. They are great for a relaxed ride. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making them fun to ride. The price? Less than £500.'"
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the title would make it a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very successful, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on communication between men and women is very popular in the self-help industry. This industry is growing and helps people who want to improve their lives. It also supports the publishing world in New York. In Britain, the self-help genre is also becoming popular, but many books are not published because they are too similar to others. Editors look for books that can sell well. Dione Reverend says that a catchy title is very important for a book's success.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an agreement with the reader that the truth is being told. However, writers often do not tell the whole truth. They might leave out things that are too embarrassing or not important. Sometimes, writers change the truth to make their story more interesting or to show a deeper truth. Some writers might even call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This is not always done to deceive readers.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They often show the conflicts in society. In these stories, a crime represents human desires like greed, and solving the crime shows how society can work well again. In Hammett's stories, society is shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is both a part of the law and a bit of a criminal. He sometimes feels connected to the criminals, and this affects his work.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a well-known science writer. He believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the culture of science. Only scientists can explain science well because they know the rules. Gould advises not to simplify the argument too much when writing. You can make the language easier, but you should not treat the reader as if they are not smart. If readers feel they are being talked down to, they will lose interest."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in the City of London, the air feels very cold. This gym is popular with workers during lunch. To handle the very hot summer, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. This is an example of how people often use too much air-conditioning. It is now a big part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls that keep out heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can work well and reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are again interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm and romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I used to think china-painting was for serious, older women who painted flowers on teacups perfectly. I saw this at an arts and crafts show long ago. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners also be so talented? But the class was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups quickly like I remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, staying at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk said the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
When they arrived, a woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was part of the plan. It was almost midnight when they reached the hotel, and they were too tired to ask questions. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist said they could enjoy the lake and take a steamer to Interlaken.
Keith calmly told the receptionist there was a mistake. ""We were meant to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" The receptionist said he didn't know about a mistake. Dawne described the travel agency clerk who made the booking. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, came over. Dawne explained they were in the wrong hotel. Mrs. Franks said there are many holidays with similar tickets and labels, and sometimes people follow the wrong group.
Keith insisted they were not supposed to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she would check and left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne whispered that Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, remembering everything that happened at the airport.
An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, spoke to them. They said they had a great night's sleep because of the lakeside air. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of their situation: on their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up with a group of elderly people, when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had said this when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American business leaders are looking at the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. In America, however, he is only now becoming well-known. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing great interest. Books about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being written and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and learn lessons in leadership and communication from his story. They even use the term 'speaking Shackleton' among themselves. Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become an example for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has used Shackleton as a role model for years. His company deals with communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, when a company's plant explodes or when half the workforce must be let go. MacGregor says, 'Even if a company handles its crises well, it can still cause problems by communicating poorly.' Shackleton is a model for management because he was a great leader and communicator. He had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his credibility for future expeditions: the lives of his men were most important. This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole when, 97 miles short of their goal, with delays using up their supplies and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, MacGregor says, people want to know someone is in charge. Today, managers often avoid responsibility, but Shackleton was ready to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and was eventually crushed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'We will all reach safety if you continue to do your best and trust me.' From the diaries and accounts kept by his men, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to start over when something was lost. We've created a set of principles here that Shackleton demonstrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in difficult situations is to do nothing, especially in America, where people want quick solutions,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and the interest rates change, you should wait, and eventually, you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a big loss. Also, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product is bad, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying if he didn't wear them, he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, says: 'The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism today. Everything else fades away, and he remains the true example of the ideals we long for now.'"
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar's Forests In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to scoop out the insects. Scientists have known about the aye-aye's feeding habits for over a hundred years, but only recently discovered how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He tested if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood, like holes where insects might have entered. Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several holes. Some holes led to mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, without needing to see the surface holes. They didn't use smell or sound to find the insects either. They could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent. Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes could sense empty spaces in the wood. They tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their large ears. Dr. Erickson thinks they use echo-location, like bats, to find hollow spaces. They might also hear insects move when disturbed by the tapping. The idea that aye-ayes take the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also look for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role might not be empty. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat combined. It also acts like a squirrel because its teeth grow continuously, and it can gnaw through nut shells to get the nut inside.'"
CAE_19,C1,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories often don't tell us everything. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they still don't tell the whole story.
Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted, about ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves.""
The promise of privacy helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" He did it for his family, but hasn't let his children read it yet. He thinks they might learn something, but he prefers they read it after he is gone.
Ms. Renier notices that many people repeat patterns from their childhood. ""It's amazing how parents influence their children,"" she says. ""People often marry someone their parents would like, or the opposite as a rebellion."" Many people still feel disappointed about things with their parents, even 60 years later.
Ms. Renier is more of a recorder than an investigator. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy,"" she says. People sometimes share things and then wonder if it should be included. She includes it, but they can remove it later. Most people want to be honest.
""It's not about showing off,"" she says. ""Things are changing fast, and we are losing touch with the past. This is a way to connect with our ancestors."" Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story. Modern technology helps her produce everything except the book cover. The books are not cheap, costing nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost stops many people. ""I thought it would be more affordable,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often wealthy, the kind who would have had portraits painted for their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, nothing here is original. All sculptures are accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together here. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.
**B. Cambridge Darkroom**
Cambridge Darkroom is a photography center with community darkrooms and a gallery showing different photography exhibitions. We often run courses and workshops for all ages and skill levels, including a Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows members to use our darkrooms. We also help young photographers (aged 12 to 16) improve their skills with our Young Members program, led by our resident photographer. We sell photographic books, magazines, and materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**
The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all over the world and from all geological ages. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, made by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting items in their original early 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, added a lot to the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, showing major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern use.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**
There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos throughout Great Britain. The photos are interesting as they show the landscape and human activity from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. The photos cannot be borrowed, but copies can be bought. These are made to order and usually take about a month.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world. It is a unique tourist attraction. You can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, called facsimiles, to preserve the originals and make brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, used as memorials instead of statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed in revolutions, but most of the remaining brasses are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"**From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**
I have had 35 years of small children because of my unusual personal life, and I have loved every minute. I fed the baby this morning, and for me, that is what being a father is all about. I am very lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I have become more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical violence. I have slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been a very attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here if they need me, but I let them call me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't been in touch, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**
I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I might have forgotten: music, youth culture, clothes. This has been very helpful for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy with my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I am sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising awards with us without feeling shy. I think it helps that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.
**C. The Politician**
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events where my kids can come with me. This way, they know what I do when I am not with them, and there is no feeling of Daddy disappearing. I have noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the need to involve our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**
My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about being a father. I tried hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even lived next door to each other for a while, so the kids could come and go as they wanted, but I think they found that confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too liberal. I think I could have been more organized. Instead, I was very relaxed. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**
I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep buying new sofas when we could have a kid instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are. But you also become just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. I sometimes feel annoyed, but one look at her takes that away. A baby's smile is the best way to make a grown man feel better."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science Defying Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a normal aircraft. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, similar to a Boeing 707. But inside, it was different. The 13 students from Europe and America were about to have an amazing flight. Inside, it was a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except a few at the back, where the nervous students sat. For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight. The European Space Agency challenged them to suggest creative experiments in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, like a wild roller-coaster ride. For two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, going up and down. At the top of each curve, the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters. The plane went higher by its own momentum before gravity pulled it down again. In those few seconds, everything inside became weightless, and the students felt closer to the moon than Earth.
The aircraft took off smoothly, but soon the pilot made it climb at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies floated in the cabin. Then the engines stopped, and we were weightless almost instantly. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence. The floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us towards the ceiling. We floated aimlessly; directions like left or right, up or down, no longer made sense. Gravity helps us understand where we are. After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned suddenly, and some students landed with a bump. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They used a device to turn it belly-down with radio control. During another curve, a student accidentally landed on it. Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by no gravity, thinking about future space stations. Students from Utah State University tested making solar sails from thin liquid films in microgravity. They believe these sails could use the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.
After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I wanted to become an astronaut before, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology."" He talks to Danny Danziger about his experiences in New Zealand.
I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand. So, I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.
I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs. So, the idea of planting trees sounded nice, and I was excited. My family became enthusiastic as we continued. We started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres.
In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. It was a very happy time, even though it rained almost every day we were planting. I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for so long. Every morning, we had to prepare for planting. We would get out of the Land Rover, warm and dry, but the rain would start, and our clothes were still wet from the day before. Our boots were soaked, and our hands struggled with slippery laces.
In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles, and plant along the line. I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs. You develop a regular process: take the tree from the bag, dig a hole, plant it, stamp it in, and move on.
Mentally, it was interesting. My mind started thinking about life and the natural world. Many ideas that have influenced my life began during those days. I've returned to New Zealand four times since then to see the trees grow, which is satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand. But the trees are now 20 years old and doing well.
In 1984, I took a break from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" there. I stayed in a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. The connection between me and that area is still very strong. It's the place where I feel most connected to the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Bringing Up Badgers**
""What now?"" I thought when a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset, where we care for orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange, like a mix between a laugh and a bark. Inside, I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between January and March and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. These cubs were found by builders who accidentally destroyed their home. The mother was dead, and the cubs were still with her. They were healthy but cold and crying. After cleaning them, I placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. I fed them with a syringe and used a warm cloth to mimic their mother licking them, which helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they ate every four hours. Soon, they drank from a bottle and moved around a bit. They seemed happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.
Three weeks later, Willow seemed tired but still ate normally. I didn't realize it was a warning sign, and the next morning, he was dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, or liquid can go into the lungs. This caused Willow's infection, which was hard to treat. I was sad but continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He was cold and hungry, so we named him Willow II. He was about two weeks younger than the females and difficult to feed. I had to move the bottle around in his mouth to get him to drink. After a while, he would finally drink as if he hadn't all day.
By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and other foods. Willow II was different. He gave up the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods. At nearly five months old, they all ate cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were lucky because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.
By August, the cubs became more active at night. We often walked through the orchard, where they played and chased each other. Derek joined us sometimes but didn't learn to avoid their playful bites. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food, as badgers are territorial and can be aggressive. We were warned they might attack our cubs, so we made their pen more secure. The local press took pictures of me with the badgers, and we started a project to build a home for them on the farm. With help, we designed a sett with tunnels and a viewing area. As it took shape, the badgers explored it and eventually moved in. The cost was high, but a local bus company and other businesses helped. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home.
One evening, they moved into their new home. I checked on them later and saw them sleeping peacefully. Now, I don't walk with them as often because they are active late at night. We see Primrose sometimes, as she joined another group, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before heading out. This is their territory now, a place they know well and have accepted as home."
CAE_67,C1,"**In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was to map the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors could not correct their compasses, making it hard to find longitude and navigate the oceans.
Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was stopped early because of problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a map in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.
Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. Halley was not only an astronomer but also did research in geophysics and led expeditions. He even helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.
Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements like Halley did, but with more accurate tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field.
Dr. Clark explains that measuring the direction of the magnetic field requires knowing true north, which they can find using global positioning satellites. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the expedition. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.
Halley's Atlantic journey was the first scientific sea expedition, and he was the first civilian naval captain focused on declination. Dr. Clark has the experience needed for this journey, having spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. The expedition will have four stages with different crews.
Dr. Clark is willing to dedicate eight months to this project, showing his passion for Halley's work. He says, ""Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,C1,"**Power Dressing Every Summer**
Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display is a mystery that puzzled Charles Darwin. In a world where animals compete to survive, how did peacocks evolve such extravagant tails? Darwin thought that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the strongest and smartest survive. But the peacock's tail seemed to be a problem, not a help. So, Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection.' He believed females chose males for their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a good reason. Maybe these males had other qualities that helped them survive. Today, scientists like Marion Petrie are studying peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if peahens really choose the males with the best tails and if these males have other advantages.
Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails. But it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways. Some scientists think that showy males might be healthier and have fewer parasites. Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the attractive ones have healthier children.
There is another idea called 'Fisher's Runaway,' proposed by R.A. Fisher. It suggests that if females start choosing males with slightly better tails, over time, this preference will grow. This could lead to peacocks having such long tails, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with new technology. Most of these yachts are based on a design change from 25 years ago. My boat, however, is different. It sits quietly on a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. Some might think I am a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but modern technology made it easier to build.
Modern technology is important in boat design and building, but it can also make sailing too easy. Many people go to sea to experience the challenges of sailing. I don't think sailors should suffer, but I like my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. If every sail works automatically, why go sailing? Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of the fun. Also, why move the steering from the back to the middle of the boat? This change makes more room inside, but I think a boat should feel like a boat, not a house.
I once had a boat called Hirta, which I used to sail around Britain for a TV race. The previous owner said it had comfort but no luxury. Hirta had heavy sails, no electric water pump, no fridge, no central heating, and no electronics, but it was the nicest boat I ever sailed. However, old boats need a lot of care. After I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a new boat I liked, so I decided to build one.
The Westerman has been great. Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his assistant, used computers to help design it, but Nigel first drew it on a napkin. He then made a model, like in the old days. We looked at the model and made changes on the computer. The final design was perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. It looks timeless, sails well, and feels peaceful inside. It was designed as a sailing boat, not a floating house. This shows that you don't need to follow trends to be happy. Built with treated wood, it is waterproof like a fiberglass boat but feels like a traditional one."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**
I was happy to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors are very good, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff are friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to add a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles or walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt better and more energetic. I want to visit again. This is a great break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me! - Marcella D'Argy Smith
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**
The calm atmosphere of this stately home was clear from the moment I arrived. The Hall has a beautiful library and conservatory. On arrival, everyone gets a medical check-up. We were called patients, which was strange because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem during my check-up, and we worked on it in fitness classes. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry and had a headache on the second day. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit with yoghurt. If you are not on a diet, you eat in the main dining hall where the food is tasty. You get a massage or water therapy every other day. Extra treatments are well-priced. - Liz Gregory
**C. CAREYS MANOR**
Careys is not a health farm. It is a lovely old manor with log fires and a big lounge. If you are watching your weight, you might skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and desserts. The hotel has a gym and pool to help burn calories. There is also a spa bath, steam room, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on my shoulder injury. Careys is comfortable and luxurious. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around. - Beverly D'Silva
**D. CLIVEDEN**
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, and horse riding. There are beautiful walks and gardens. Waldo's restaurant has amazing food. The dinner menu is long, and the meal was wonderful. I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has fitness assessments and beauty treatments if you want them. - Kay Letch

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is delicious but high in calories. The aromatherapy massage is also great. I chose relaxing oils and had a good night's sleep. The place is modern with many facilities and luxurious rooms. There are many therapists, so it is easy to get appointments. They offer treatments like manicures and facials. Guests include football teams, families, and friends. I would like to visit once a month. - Eve Cameron"
CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still more than 98% the same as chimps. On a big evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is a recent change. Our ability to make art and do other human things must come from a small part of our genes. This is a lot to expect from just a few genes. 
Studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are not. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences between us and animals, except for art.
If human art comes from a special genetic gift, it's strange that our ancestors didn't use it for most of the 7 million years since they split from chimps. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't know because those materials don't last. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings and statues, only appears around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.
If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from animal art? Three differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it's made for beauty, and it's learned, not instinctive.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" Human art doesn't help us survive or pass on genes, unlike most animal behaviors. For example, birdsong helps defend territory or attract mates, which helps pass on genes. By this measure, human art is different.
Second, human art is said to be motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, so they probably don't sing just for pleasure. Again, human art seems unique.
Third, human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, inherit their songs and would sing them even if they never heard them. It's like a French baby raised in Japan singing the French national anthem without learning it.
The role of learning in human art is clear in how quickly styles change. Geese honked 2,000 years ago as they do today, but human art changes fast. Even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, they might mistake the works of two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and most were sold, which many human artists can't claim.
These paintings by chimps blur the lines between human art and animal activities. Like human art, the ape paintings had no practical use and were made for the painter's satisfaction. You might say human art is different because it's meant to communicate, but some famous human art was also made for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,C1,"**A Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. Today, you don't find such people in stories or real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey at his family home. The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and could have ruined the expedition.
This group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least friendly desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote an interesting account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a big risk. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back because nobody had ever done that route; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'
Anyone reading his story of that crossing will wonder why he used the word 'kind'. The team suffered many hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never faced the raw, biting desert cold that would have stopped us completely. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against challenges the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were very hard to climb, for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.
'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. 'I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment, I was a very scared man.'
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and strong despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'
Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How aware was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that measure, the desert does not compare.'
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"
CAE_18,C1,"Susan Harr decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and save time. But Susan thinks we might be too dependent on technology. She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which was expensive to fix. This made her question if gadgets are worth the trouble and cost. 
Susan started letting her household gadgets go when they stopped working. She wonders if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets. When her sewing machine broke, she decided to sew by hand. She found it relaxing and enjoyable. She can sew while listening to the radio or talking with family and friends. 
Susan also returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change made her family spend more time walking the dog, reading, and talking. She realized that doing things by hand, like sewing, can be satisfying and calming. It slows down life and gives her time to think. 
Now, Susan looks around her house and wonders if she really needs things like the freezer, microwave oven, or electric lights. She thinks she could save money by living with fewer gadgets."
CAE_62,C1,"'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from making beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man who is always busy. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he greets me quickly and says, 'Well, fire away then!' It's not clear if he is really in a hurry or just a bit shy. But when you look around his workshop, you can see he is very busy. The workshop is full of half-made furniture and pieces of wood in many natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. His schedule is always full for months, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the person to go to. Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes beautiful, simple furniture is not easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says. He is disappointed by some modern furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He doesn't like cheap, mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who make poor-quality pieces. Hurst's search for perfection and his talent are keys to his success. He is confident about his skills. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says. 'I have always been good at making things.' Hurst is self-taught. How did he learn? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says. Most of his work comes from private clients. Some clients come back many times. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he admits that working with clients is not always easy. 'The most annoying clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favorite clients are the exacting ones.' Hurst is happy with his work but also praises others when they deserve it. 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (a top furniture design school). He is critical of craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also doesn't like degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. 'A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.' Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he says, 'After all, I am only making furniture.'"
CAE_49,C1,"'Three ideas about why we sleep People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. But, why do we sleep? Scientists do not fully agree on the reason. There are three main ideas. The first and most popular idea is that sleep is mainly for our body. It says we sleep to keep our body healthy. While we sleep, our body fixes any damage from the day and makes us ready for the next day. The second idea focuses on learning. It says sleep helps us process information we learn during the day. Without sleep, we would not learn well. The third idea is about energy. It says we need sleep to recharge our energy, like recharging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"**Eccentrics**
An eccentric is someone whose behavior is different from what is normal. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own little habits. It could be entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about many topics. Eccentricity is about being unique. Inside us, there is a struggle between wanting to be different and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains pushing against each other on the same track. One train is called individualism, and the other is conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong. This is stronger than wanting to stand out and be different.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find others like them. They form clubs and have meetings to share their interests. They want to find others who understand them. Even a small group can make them feel better. We all feel a pull between being unique and fitting in. We might say we are different, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new person says, ""You must take me as you find me.""
Anyone can choose to be more individual. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, an American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then pursue it, don't back down and don't give up."" But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. If a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a hostess says shocking things to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. If they keep doing these things until they can't go back to normal behavior, then they might be eccentric.
The key to being eccentric is being natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care about what others think. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of the world and react to it. Some want to impress society, and some want to escape it, but they are aware of it. Eccentrics, however, continue on their own path without concern for society."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four naturalists to tell us about the wildlife book that influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**
Choosing the author was easy. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in the field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences into a strong philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But ""The Home of Man"" is, to me, her most important book. It talks about the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a powerful call for what we now call 'sustainable human development.' I have not found another book like it.
**B. Linda Bennett**
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a herring gull colony. This book explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to an organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with Eric Ennion, a talented wildlife artist, to create this book. Ennion's paintings, with simple lines and colors, show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the work of a true field naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**
""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book defined my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was facing many challenges, but reading this book made my world brighter. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty all connected. Many say humans are the worst because of the harm we cause, but I remember Gerald as a boy, seeing the world as a family. This is a concept we all need to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library after it was published in 1966. I was drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and spent holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to sketch birds to help with identification. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered more. It had chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images made me appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was my strong subject, I saw new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"'DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are very important for publishers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than for other reasons like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are usually calmer about bad reviews. They think that any review, good or bad, can help sales because readers want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of the book. Publisher B Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make a book and author known. A good review by a trusted person can increase sales, especially if there are many reviews. Fame helps sell books. Publisher C Reviews are very important for literary publishing. We publish books by authors who are not famous, so we rely on reviews. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest. Reviews can help sell books, but they need to work with other things like word of mouth and good marketing. Publisher D In Britain, the link between publishing and reviews is unclear. In the US, a review in the New York Times can greatly affect a book's success. In Britain, bookshops often don't pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for a writer to become popular. Some poorly reviewed books sell very well. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself. Publisher E All publishers and writers want long, positive reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography with great reviews, but it didn't sell well because people felt they didn't need to buy it after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the surprise choice of reviewer or the quality of the review that attracts buyers.'"
CAE_2,C1,"'WEATHERVANE MAKER Making weathervanes is a very old skill, starting in ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in Graham Smith's workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates special designs for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique and personal item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's work or hobbies.' This is different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common for weathervanes. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I saw that there are endless ideas for weathervanes,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I really enjoy designing.' Graham has now made over 100 original designs. He works with great detail and always gets the customer's approval before cutting the design by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are as popular as the custom ones. 'People like hand-made things,' Graham says. 'They like to have something a bit different.' Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique items, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing wind direction changes,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want a special touch for their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'The price,' he explains, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift.'"
CAE_68,C1,"**Beginner Takes All**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already a very popular book. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about his inspiration and success.
At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans. He is a screenwriter, producer, and wants to be a director. His year started badly when a film project called *Life and Limb*, which he had worked on for months, suddenly failed. He was worried because he hadn't earned any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to pay the bank. 
Instead of finding a job, Evans made a surprising decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months. The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These men were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was fascinated and started researching to write a screenplay. But after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead.
In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his future. By August, he had written half of the book and showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and said Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts and support his family. He was advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.
In October, the first 200 pages and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. The book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans was shocked by the success. 
Hollywood studios also wanted the book. Evans' UK agent worked with an agent in the US, and they received an offer of $3 million for the film rights. Four famous filmmakers called Evans to ask for the chance to make the movie.
Evans shared this story while we drank coffee at his home. He said he turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He didn't want to spoil the fairy tale by becoming an employee. He wanted to stay involved but not too closely. The success of his novel also brought new interest in *Life and Limb*, but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. He thought it would be wise to write another novel."
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Masters Bobby Fischer is trying to make a comeback in chess, but age is not on his side. Chess is now a game for younger people. After 20 years away, Mr. Fischer is playing against Boris Spassky again. Mr. Fischer won the first game with a great move, but he is not the same as he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in good shape. Mr. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Mr. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now it is more professional. Winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intelligence. The game is very intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose. Now, games last longer and are played without breaks, which benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the top ten players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board. Players must prepare well before matches, especially because computers have changed chess. A small computer can store one million chess games and help players study their opponents. In one match, players used teams to find weaknesses in each other's games. The start of a chess game is now studied very carefully. Being well-prepared can decide the game. Today, there are more top players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success needs both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours. Players must stay focused, as a mistake can be costly. The chess clock adds pressure. The end of a game can be a fast 'time scramble', where players have only seconds to make moves. This is not for thinkers; it is a battle of nerves and willpower. Losing is very painful at this level, while winning brings great satisfaction. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to compete the next day. Most tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow was stopped because both players were too tired. Mr. Karpov lost about 10kg. Can Mr. Fischer succeed? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his leaving chess in 1972 surprising. But it also made him a legend. If he returned for money, he will earn a lot. No matter what happens in his match with Mr. Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Mr. Fischer came back to prove he is still the best, the result might be disappointing.'"

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" Before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it causes. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing school, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very exciting.""
**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has progressed a lot since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.
**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show was very well-received, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""I can now choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to be successful. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for more success, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company talks about a big hit, but I have no idea. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. I've been in some terrible bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won many prizes and awards. He is well-known in the poetry world and has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express in a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became unhappy with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry being praised, moving to novels is brave. ""There's a structure in my poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for mistakes. My main goal is not to just produce work without caring about the quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance books and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knees might stop her from finding love. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style like an old silent movie. B. This story is about the start and near end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the view of a smart child, Francis With, who works for WLT Radio. The station was created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, and soap-opera stars. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old cars and radios. C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. Professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poetess and talks to his wife's ex about it. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother in prison. The author makes these problems interesting and funny, and the story is enjoyable and clever. D. Two pairs of best friends, two women and two men, meet in London in the 1960s and stay connected for 25 years. One of them, James Hudson, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is good. The book is long, allowing readers to really get to know the characters. E. This story, by a great American writer, is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a mistake and becomes a father to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is becoming an unusual bachelor. The story shows many emotions and focuses on Ian's sweet relationship with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book with a good mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism: A Discussion**
**A.** Volunteer tourism is when people travel to help build homes or schools. They often pay a lot of money to do this work. This money could be more useful if given directly to the local community. Many volunteers are young people on gap years who do not have special skills. Some studies question if these volunteers really want to help or if they are more interested in improving their own careers. However, volunteering can help people become more ethical and caring in their future lives.
**B.** Volunteering can help people from different countries understand each other better. It can also help solve conflicts and create international friendships. This can be good for both volunteers and the communities they visit. But if only rich people can afford to volunteer, it mainly benefits them and not the communities. These volunteers might use the experience to advance their own careers.
**C.** Sometimes, international volunteering can seem like charity from rich countries or a way for people to improve their own lives. But it can also be a way to share skills and learn from each other. Volunteering can make people aware of global problems like poverty and injustice, and encourage them to help solve these issues.
**D.** Volunteer tourism is popular because it seems like a simple way to help others. It avoids big government and business, focusing on personal acts of charity. However, it often does not change the real problems in poor communities. Some people think volunteer tourism is just a way to feel good about helping, without really understanding global poverty."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**
Many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them wake up. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models.
The first model has a 'dual alarm function.' I thought it meant you could snooze and then wake up again, but it actually lets you set two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model also has a cassette player, which is a good deal since it costs about the same as the second model. You can fall asleep to your own tapes and wake up without news. We liked the radio quality, but it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case.
The second model was the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze bar is wide, so you can tap it with your eyes closed. It has a self-power back-up, so you don't have to reset it if the plug is pulled out. We found it hard to set up, but once we learned, we felt 'cool' and sophisticated.
Tom Granger thought the third model, with its built-in lamp, was 'tacky.' You have to pull the light out of its socket to use it, which made him question its quality. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work. The light only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer was loud and annoying, but this model is the third most popular on the market.
The fourth model is aimed at young people with its bright colors and strap. Tom Granger and I liked it because it stands out. It was the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges found it 'fiddly' and 'useless.'
The last model is the simplest and cheapest. Tom Granger liked it because it was standard and took up little space. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found intuitive. He admitted that button-tuning has improved radio quality. I thought the tuning was basic, but the radio quality was fine. The buzzer worked well, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked, so their spines stick out. This helps protect them. The number of spines a hedgehog has can make this defense more or less effective. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines because they need to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and use their ball rolling as a last option. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in a hole in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,C1,"Title: Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak
Being successful in sports is tough for everyone, but women often face extra challenges. They have to train hard and make sacrifices, but they are overcoming obstacles and setting new records. Here, we meet some talented British sportswomen who are achieving their dreams.
A. Jill, 27, Skier
""I love the feeling of flying through the air and landing perfectly, but it can be scary. Sometimes the weather is bad, but you just have to keep going. We train for ten months a year, so it's hard to have a career outside skiing. I chose this life, even though it means giving up a lot of my social life. In the British team, there are six men and three women. We compete on the same courses and are treated equally.""
B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won! I had never cycled before. Now, I'm a professional and well-paid. Cycling offers many opportunities for sponsorships. I worry people think I succeed because of my looks, not my skills. I focus on cycling, training at least four hours a day, plus other exercises. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitment.""
C. Annabel, 26, Rower
""Rowing is hard for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most start at 19 or 20, making it tough to succeed internationally. Coaches often change, so the women's team lacks stability. But I love being fit and the social life is great.""
D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world. Britain felt too small and safe. I was stubborn and disliked being controlled. Now, I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the hardest due to pain, doing 50 miles a day with little sleep. I got the record because my sponsorship was ending. Men often think women will fail, so sponsoring them is seen as risky.""
E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer
""Some men have big egos when driving. If I'm doing well, they ignore me. Being a woman has downsides. Men try harder to beat me, so I've had many crashes. You need to be competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I make goes back into racing. Women have raced since the 1920s and were seen as unusual. Now, more women are racing each year. I love aiming for the perfect lap.""
F. Alison, 28, Triathlete
""I wake up at 5:30 a.m. three times a week to swim. I need other mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I fall asleep at my desk! Racing is social, and I feel happier when I'm fit. Men and women usually compete together, but media coverage focuses more on men. Prize money is also less for women. We've started an International Triathlon Women's Commission to improve this."""
CAE_34,C1,"**The Day I Drew Picasso**
Richard Cork remembers the day he met the famous artist Picasso. Richard was 18 years old and traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He was out of money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while eating at a restaurant, he saw Picasso having lunch with his wife and friends. Richard was surprised because Picasso was known to be a private person.
Encouraged by a friend, Richard approached Picasso and asked for his autograph. Picasso kindly signed Richard's sketchbook and even drew a little picture. Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, using an American woman at the table to help translate.
Richard's friend suggested he draw Picasso's portrait. Richard returned to Picasso's table and began to draw him. Picasso made funny faces and gestures, making it hard for Richard to draw. But eventually, Picasso sat still, allowing Richard to capture his likeness. Richard noticed how young and strong Picasso looked, even though he was almost 84 years old.
After Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the drawing. Richard was shy but showed it to him. Picasso then took the crayon and quickly drew a playful picture on the same page. Richard was amazed by Picasso's skill and creativity.
Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. This experience was very important to him."
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use many tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:
**A. Freshness Image**
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store look fresh. They might also have a bakery that smells like fresh bread. The store might use green colors because they remind people of fresh produce. Most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods, is not fresh, but the fresh image helps sell everything.
**B. Product Placement**
Where products are placed in a store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find the best spots for products. Items with high profits or that sell quickly are put in these spots. Shelves at eye level are popular because people notice them more. Special offers in ""dump bins"" attract bargain hunters. Stores also use ""complementation"" by placing related items together, like salad dressings near salads.
**C. Spreading Staples**
Supermarkets put basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting products. Chain stores do the same with popular items, hoping customers will look for them and see other things to buy.
**D. Less is More**
Some stores, like Next, show fewer items to make them seem special. This ""boutique"" style makes clothes look exclusive, even if they are mass-produced. Good store design helps sell the clothes.
**E. Total Cost**
Shoppers often care more about the total bill than individual prices. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as ""loss leaders."" They also buy in bulk to get discounts.
**F. Price Tags**
In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 can make a difference. It also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up the sale to give change.
**G. Lighting**
Stores use lighting carefully. Chain stores try to use natural light so clothes look the same as they would outside. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh food look better.
**H. Store Layout**
Chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One type of carpet shows the path, and another shows sales areas. Some stores use wood or marble for paths to make the carpeted sales areas more inviting.
**I. In-Store Promotion**
Supermarkets use big photos of delicious food to tempt shoppers. In the U.S., some stores use ""video trolleys"" with screens that show ads as you shop. These trolleys aim to increase impulse buying by showing ads for products near you."
CAE_26,C1,"'Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written books like Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about it in their book: Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979, while working on Quest for Adventure, Chris called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed, anchored, and then went to shore to climb. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in difficult climbing conditions. Robin had never climbed before, but he managed to lower himself down safely using his boat skills. This trip to Skye started their friendship. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye trip. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Robin, as the skipper, usually made decisions but liked to ask everyone first. Chris found sailing boring and preferred land. Robin, however, enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin didn't need much help. The yacht was small, with six people in a space meant for four. In Greenland, Chris led the climbing part. He found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tough. Robin wasn't a natural climber, but he trusted Chris completely. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours but had to turn back. Robin was worried about the boat but still wanted to try climbing again. The only problem between them was on the way home. Chris was supposed to take a shift at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him, thinking he could handle it. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland trip, Chris realized Robin was a kind and sensitive person.'"
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
**Early Apples 8,000 BC**  
People have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, they spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, people in Switzerland and Italy left apple remains near their homes. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we know today.
**Norman Influence 1000 AD**  
The French learned fruit-growing from the Romans, including cider-making. This knowledge came to Britain, along with the dessert apple, Decio, brought by the Roman general, Etio. However, most Roman apples did not grow well in Britain, so Norman varieties became more popular. British monks developed new apples, and many Western apples come from these varieties.
**Medieval Apples 1200**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known since 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the 17th century. The word 'costermonger' comes from this apple. Apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and wars. More apples were imported until the 16th century when Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple growing. Harris brought back many apple grafts, including the famous Pippins, and started a modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Apples 1750**  
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was known for his love of apple trees and his kindness to animals.
**Modern Apples 1850**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree and named it 'Hawkey'. It was later called 'Delicious' and became one of the most popular apples in the world. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith discovered another famous apple. Known as 'Granny Smith', she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit in 1868. She grew the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide.
**Uniformity 1950**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from a few varieties chosen for their appearance and ability to travel well, not for taste. This has led to less variety and a smaller gene pool. While some gardeners in the UK keep old apple varieties alive, many have been lost in the US. Consumers now want more variety. We must protect natural diversity in apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British long-distance runner, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located near Mount Kenya, a beautiful but isolated place called Nanyuki. For three years, Richard trained there during the winter but never with Kenyan runners. On his fourth trip, he changed this. He competed in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. He was invited by the Kenyan national team coach after finishing fifth in a world championship race. Training at high altitudes helps runners because it increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity. This is one reason for the success of Kenyan runners.
Richard's first race in Africa was an international cross-country race in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience because 41 runners finished ahead of him, most of them Kenyans. He realized that Kenyan success is not just due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to running. They run with ease, eat simple food, and enjoy competing. Richard wanted to know how they train.
At the training camp, located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, Richard found out. The camp is basic, with athletes living in simple dormitories. Their day includes three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple, with basic meals and few comforts. After running, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya.
By the end of his stay, Richard appreciated Kenyan success even more. He thought it was not just about genetics, upbringing, or altitude. The simple lifestyle, hard training, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's success in distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"'The Ups and Downs of Mass Marketing
Advertising is having a tough time. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising started to drop in 1989, even before the recession hit hard. The problem is bigger and affects the whole world. Advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but as more brands and media appear, target markets have become smaller. Big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.
Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these won't be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For things like cars, you might buy one every three years, and it might be from your employer. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with things like candy, medicine, and services, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.
Compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys 400 of these, and not all because of ads. That's about 4 percent. So, 96 percent of advertising might be wasted, but no one knows which part. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about one in 16 (6 percent), so the other 15 (94 percent) seem wasted.
You might think you're not affected by ads, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste can't be avoided. But advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the right few, because advertisers can't know who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to reach many people.
However, waste is still a problem. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail doesn't get a 100 percent response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. This can't happen with media. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need media. This is true for all ads, from soft drinks to important notices.
Any advertiser who gains one million new customers (2 percent of adults) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million extra customers. So, any ad campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population is very successful. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more precisely than ever before.'"
CAE_43,C1,"'Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is 300 yards from the Minster. It matches the town's old buildings and was approved by planners, even though it is in a conservation area. The house is super-insulated, with special windows, so you don't hear any noise inside. Inside, you must take off your shoes, and it feels very quiet. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Vale opens windows and ventilation shafts to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, cared about the environment long before it became a big issue. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They designed a building that emits no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water, which they filter before use. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't have a dishwasher because they don't want to use strong detergents. 'We wanted to show that it was possible to design a house that is less harmful to the environment without living in the dark,' says Robert. The house's only medieval aspect is its look: the hall, with the hearth and staircase, is the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is what other four-bedroom houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less when solar panels and equipment are installed in the garden. The house will use electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances but will generate extra electricity. There will even be enough to charge an electric car one day. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales say they use only in the coldest winter. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room temperature was 18C, which is comfortable because there are no draughts and no heat loss. An Edwardian lady in the early 1900s was comfortable at 12.5C because of her clothing. People in old houses should live like they did back then, he suggests. But this idea might not become popular. The house is low-tech, so there is little to go wrong. Most materials were bought from a builder's merchant and installed by local workers. This made the house cheap to build, costing the same per square metre as low-cost housing for rent. Commercial building companies are not interested in this idea.'"
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man, like a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies in a garden, he believed they were real proof that fairies existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are very beautiful. But the simple trick shows that a basic idea about photography, that the camera cannot lie, is not true. Cameras can lie, and they always could. Today, we use computer programs to change our digital photos, and it is not true that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, when cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
Iron has always been important to people, and those who work with it, called blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by talented blacksmiths.
However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern buildings rarely used decorative ironwork. But in the past 10 years, there has been a revival due to more interest in decorative architecture and creative interior design. Still, much of the work looks old-fashioned, with many gates and balconies being advertised as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy design stores often sell rusty candlesticks with decorations.
Fortunately, there are new options, and several events aim to promote blacksmithing. The first event is an exhibition of ironwork by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says we might be entering a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently. Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to be more creative. Dawson says, 'These artists now have a material which allows them to express themselves.'
About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most of the money will go to the makers, but some will support the promotion of good ironwork. Dawson's own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and flow when it's hot, like drawing with metal in space.
Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals, iron and steel are tough and demanding. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's soft when hot but becomes hard when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans creates door-knockers and handles inspired by horror film castles. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. She loves that steel feels permanent.
Iron has given people visual pleasure and a sense of security. It is likely to be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,C1,"Title: The Day I Stopped Smoking
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just four hours. It even surprised me. 
The session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by people who pressured others to quit smoking. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.
On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking in Birmingham to write an article about people trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't try to stop myself; it wouldn't be fair. I'm here to write, not to quit, so it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me."" I thought I was being reasonable. I actually enjoyed smoking; it made me happy. The counselor seemed to look at me knowingly.
We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't really want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about quitting made sense to me. Just like smoking was a challenge because people were against it, the idea of stopping started to seem appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me. Could I also achieve other things?
In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, like hunger, went away after a minute or two, and I only felt it for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I couldn't meet deadlines without smoking, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, spending weekend mornings at home was the hardest part, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was something to do. Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is different—eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,C1,"**Dorothy Who?**
Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but not many people in Britain know her name. Georgina Ferry, who is writing a biography about Hodgkin, has noticed this. When she tells people about her work, only a few recognize Hodgkin's name.
Dorothy Hodgkin was a remarkable scientist. She won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for her work on the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12. Later, in 1969, she also solved the structure of insulin. Her work was very important and complex, and she was a pioneer in her field.
Hodgkin's life was interesting not only because of her science. She lived through important changes in the 20th century, like the advancement of women's education and the globalization of science. She also balanced her career with her family life, having three children and a husband who was often away for his work as a historian.
Many people think that scientists' lives are not as interesting as those of artists or writers. This is why there are fewer biographies about scientists. However, this is changing. Books about scientists like Richard Feynman have shown that their lives can be fascinating. These books include personal stories, which help readers understand the scientists as people.
It is important to know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. Her passion for science and her ability to balance different parts of her life can inspire us all. Understanding science is not harder than learning a new language or reading Shakespeare; it just requires effort. It is a shame that many educated people do not know about the contributions of scientists like Hodgkin."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Special Skill
Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.
This skill is called dowsing. It is the ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground. Some people think it is a 'sixth sense'. There are many ideas about how it works. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers, like Margaret, might be able to feel these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.
In recent years, there have been many droughts, so Margaret has been very busy. At one point, people had to wait almost six weeks for her help. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She also helps people with holiday homes far from water pipes and golf-course developers who need water for clubhouses.
Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She avoids places where farm waste could get into the water. The water she finds is in rock fissures, which keeps it clean. However, in Cornwall, there is a lot of iron, so she has to be careful. The well also needs to be near electricity to power the pump.
To find water on large areas like golf courses, Margaret starts with a map and a pendulum. She moves the pendulum over the map, and it swings when there is water. Then, she walks over the land with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. The stick rises when water is below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If she and her husband do not agree on the spot, they keep looking.
Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition. Many people are interested in how she does it. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This skill helps her family run their well-drilling business successfully year after year."
CAE_36,C1,"'We changed lives for a day! Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to do something different for a change? We arranged it for four people - read how it went. Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a busy London restaurant. A. Amanda's story I had never been in a place like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a great atmosphere. It was very different from my home town, and I wasn't sure I'd manage! Being a mother is a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was getting used to it, the drinks started to fall off the tray and crashed on the floor, spilling cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first! By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but that wasn't a problem because everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet really hurt and I couldn't get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say 'Pardon?', which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realized how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be quite friendly and able to stay calm with lots of customers! I'm really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets very busy. I wasn't too impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me! I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing! B. Cindy's story I was feeling quite nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I'd been warned the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. Little did I know! As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing. At 1 pm I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the sofa into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they could! I decided to take it easy, thinking they'd soon get tired. Wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they beat me! After much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink? Of course, I realized it was just a trick so they could come downstairs and watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never realized how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sense of responsibility is huge. Even so, I really enjoyed the day. Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school. C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was a real treat! But I took a long time deciding what to wear. I couldn't turn up in overalls and boots, could I? Looking at a sea of faces -- about 400 pupils -- at assembly, I hoped I blended in and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm. After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables together! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails. By lunchtime, I was exhausted and looking forward to a break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid helping with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practice on me, which really showed up my rusty French. Finally, we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have endless energy. The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's scary. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming, anyway! D. Hilary's story I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers, and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants, and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons, and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself from tasting the goodies! At lunchtime, it was time to check the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe which had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over, they could die, so they have to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't talk back! The worst part of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems romantic but the reality is very different. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.'"
CAE_6,C1,"'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who didn't play music, is now a famous trumpet player. He is from a small town in southern Sweden and became well-known by the age of 30. His music includes both old and new pieces. When you meet him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London, and a TV show talked about his work and life, showing parts filmed in Sweden and London. 
Hakan was born near Malmo, and his career started because of a Christmas gift when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved it and played all the time. His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, who was a talented musician. Bo saw Hakan's natural talent and helped him a lot. Hakan is grateful for having such a good teacher who loved the trumpet and was always learning more about it. 
Hakan explains that the trumpet is not a perfect instrument, and each one has its flaws. He believes in understanding these flaws and working with them. From a young age, he had a special sound that people could recognize. Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player who started in brass bands, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter, and collected all his records. His parents supported his dream to become a professional trumpet player. 
At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised him against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hakan knew he was good, but it was during a competition in Paris at 17 that he realized he could really connect with people through music. He entered the competition for experience and reached the final round, even though he didn't win. He learned that people enjoyed his performance, even if he thought it wasn't perfect. 
Hakan is realistic about his talent and doesn't try to explain why he can connect with audiences. He believes that music's power is in its ability to move people.'"

CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7.30 am. I manage customer programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in Europe. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program in Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan strategies. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets once or twice a week. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10.00 am and go through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters, and invoices. The phone starts ringing at 10.30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing. I also manage budgets. I leave work at 7.00 pm and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. I might visit an artist in the studio after a gig. I usually get home by 1.00 am and listen to a record to relax.
**C. Sales Director**
I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9.30 am. I check the mail and diary to see if we have clients visiting. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and selling furniture. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from various sources. Many items need restoration, so I work with restorers and repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette to stay updated and visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm and take about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work in shifts and leave home at 6.00 am for an early shift. At 7.00 am, I take over one of the four control positions in the tower. We rotate stations, working for about an hour and a half, then taking a break. We control aircraft movements as a team. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I read up on new air traffic requirements. It's important to be alert, so I take sick leave if needed. The job is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and maybe a general manager.
**E. Shop Manager**
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic sales system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate breaks. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be annoying when they bring reviews and expect quick service. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm, publishers' reps visit, and I discuss new titles. I decide how many copies to order. It's important to have new titles delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the shop and going home.
**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then take a taxi to work by 8.45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about the region I cover. I assess financial risks for companies abroad, warning clients of potential issues. I provide three services: an online newsflash, a security forecast, and a travel security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first newsflash is due by 10.00 am, and the second by 11.00 am, so I work quickly. I type stories, send them to my editor, and make changes before they go live. I travel to Africa three times a year to report on events. I leave work around 6.00 pm, but it's hard to relax, and I'm often awake until 1.00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**
A good leader inspires others and shows the way forward. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""
B. **Recognizing Leadership Potential**
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says many people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing these talents. We are all born with some leadership ability, but we need the right situations to grow. While it's easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is key to effective management.
C. **Good vs. Bad Bosses**
Think about the best and worst boss you've had. They might both be good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve them? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second managed poorly.
D. **Leaders vs. Managers**
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new paths. Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules,"" says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can transform it.
E. **Improving Leadership Skills**
Whether you're a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you are passionate about and act on it.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
- Sometimes collaboration is good, but firm leadership is needed too. Try different styles and see how it changes outcomes.
- Set goals and try to exceed them. Identify where leadership can improve your job and career.
F. **Developing Leadership**
- Leadership develops by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.
- Your way of leading might not win everyone over. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas should be.
- Be visible and accessible to important people. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this Cold War thriller. It is about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, like foreman Bud, remind us of heroes in old movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. The story feels like a B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release is based on the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal. Directed by Andrew Marton, it is different from Terrence Malick's new film. Marton's version is a more traditional war movie and focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is more complex, but Marton's has its good moments. The flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife is powerful.
**C. On Guard**  
This film is loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel. It is a fun swashbuckler, better than most musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, and Vincent Perez is an energetic hero. Daniel Auteuil is a bit too serious for this type of film, but he still has good moments. The film uses costume-drama clichés with wit and charm.
**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this is a serious story. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless with tenants. The story focuses on his difficult relationship with his son, but the film is more interested in showing the period details.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video shows director Leone's skills well. The sound editing is excellent, with every sound clear and loud. The story is harsh, and the music by Morricone adds excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This war epic boasts 'forty-eight international stars' and is directed by four directors with 23,000 extras. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow. The film is impressive in scale but is better suited for the big screen. On video, it loses some of its impact."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A**  
Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is a very interesting book. The story is about a lawyer who starts a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a big surprise. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B**  
*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement. Sigismondo, who solves problems for rich people in the Italian Renaissance, gets involved in politics, church secrets, and murder. We know he will find the guilty people. The story is complex and a bit long, but it is still very good.
**BOOK C**  
*File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a man dies near her. She faces challenges and disapproval from a local detective, but Leah is strong and successful.
**BOOK D**  
*Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, with more thinking than violence. Parker always provides high-quality entertainment.
**BOOK E**  
*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and robbery at a famous film star's daughter's house. The author's easy style and interest in human behavior make this a fun mystery.
**BOOK F**  
*Blood Red, Snow White* is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features a lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book mixes romance, money, and violence to create an exciting suspense novel.
**BOOK G**  
*Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters come together to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip is unhappy with his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this book is not as good as his others.
**BOOK H**  
*Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police search for a smart bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the clever robber make this book better than the average detective story."
CAE_57,C1,"'I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to do it again someday. But then, I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, I realized I was giving up my happiness for my job. When I quit, it felt like I was in control of my life again. Now, I have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't change places with me, they envy my freedom. I'm not in a relationship, and I have no big career goals. I feel like I should use this freedom, even for my friends' sake! Why am I nervous? First, it's about making the necessary plans. How could I let someone else live in my home? How would I organize the rental? And I had to decide where to go. I'm bad at making decisions and am already weeks behind my plan. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Leaving emotional ties makes it harder. I'm delaying because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among young backpackers? Maybe not. I've found that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives and travel. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebooks, says people are realizing they can have adventures if they are brave, organized, and confident. For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a thought that I'm not moving up in my career, but it's a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things. I needed to change this to live as a civilian.' There are many reasons to travel at my age, but some common factors exist. 'We have a more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Big companies even have career-break policies. 'If you've trained someone, it's good to know they'll come back rather than work for a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, says more people in their thirties are rethinking their lives. 'If you're not happy with your job, it's not about just sticking with it. Now people know there are opportunities, and a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel lets you reassess and think about your life.' Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can't handle adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less worried about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We're asking, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to get what I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's about leaving behind a comfortable routine - going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having a coffee.' I share Ben's worries about leaving a stable life, and I'm not sure I'd be doing this if I didn't find my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox says: 'This is common. There's often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job. Such events can push people to go and do it.' It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. Whatever happens, I'll be happy to have taken this chance. And I think I speak for all of us older backpackers.'"
CAE_42,C1,"**Plugging in the Home**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. She shares how she turned her home into a good workplace.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career. My skills were outdated, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were used. I felt no one would hire me because I didn't know desktop publishing. I was afraid of computers and didn't even know how to use a video timer. I needed to act fast to save my career.
Then, I entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package for my family. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for everyone. We quickly learned about the Internet and started chatting with people worldwide. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. I could work from home and still take the kids to school.
The children were comfortable with computers because of school, but I was nervous. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I learned the basics, and it was easier than I thought. I started freelancing for a magazine, writing two articles a month. I felt happy having the best of both worlds.
The computer helped me become organized. I used to lose important papers, but now I use spreadsheets to track income and expenses. Pre-formatted invoices and letterheads save me time. The Internet helps me research stories and talk to other journalists.
Working from home has some downsides. You can feel isolated, and there are distractions at home. The children and I sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. But many people are buying multimedia PCs for education, leisure, and work. In my neighborhood, more people are working from home instead of commuting to the city.
A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. I seem to be ahead of the trend. Maybe one day, I'll email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or cyberspace, is the limit."
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh looks very different from the old buildings around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see if the inside was as interesting as the outside. The museum is easy to find with its big, yellow sandstone tower and unique shape. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building's design. Some loved it, calling it a 'masterpiece', while others were not so sure.
Now, as the museum is about to open, people are wondering if the exhibitions will be as interesting. The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history, using important objects like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels. The museum does not just focus on national pride but aims to be interesting for everyone. Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants visitors to have a fun and visual experience. The museum is not just for experts but for everyone, even those who know little about history.
Dr. Clarke believes in showing the truth about the past, so there are no fake scenes or imagined stories. The museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some computers to tell the stories of the objects. It is still uncertain if this will be enough to make the stories exciting.
Inside the museum, the spaces are open and bright, with daylight coming through the windows. There is a special Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of 9- to 12-year-olds from all over Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a hands-on centre for kids.
On the top floor, there is a Twentieth Century gallery with objects chosen by Scottish people and famous personalities. These objects show what has been important in Scotland in the last century. Some choices include an electric guitar and televisions. This gallery will change every three years.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects can show the past better than anything else. The modern design of the museum works well inside, but some people are not sure if it fits with the old buildings around it."
CAE_54,C1,"'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It's a nice word and a calming idea. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving smoothly from the present to the future. Unless, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, which is uncertain and uncomfortable - because it might not be a process at all. But surely (you say) it will happen eventually. Everyone knows that print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. Just look at the latest print circulation numbers. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and others are down between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites are growing. This may be true, depending on timing, age groups, location, and more. After all, everyone - from web experts to print analysts - says so. Yet, pause and notice a few things that don't quite fit. If sales in that area have fallen so little, maybe the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, the messages are mixed. The latest survey by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped, but Asia made up the difference. As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to be in trouble - they had a 5.4% increase. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many showed rapid growth. You can see a similar trend with books. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up a lot this year. The first step of transition seems clear. Yet, when booksellers looked at the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. Stories of young people abandoning newspaper-reading are exaggerated. Look at the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 following the main national dailies. And even within Europe, different countries have different stories. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany, the decline has only been 7% overall - with just 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). These different national trends may show a situation more complicated than digital revolution experts think. America's media analysts used to say that growing online advertising revenues would pay for change and, with lower production costs, make online newspapers a success. But now, with digital ads on newspaper sites actually dropping, such ideas seem outdated. Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way to attract paying readers seems to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access together. In other words, print is also important in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates make nine to ten times more money than online. Of course, this big difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex, and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; on the web, just being noticed is much harder.'"
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more interesting than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be difficult. Besides thinking about the camera settings and artistic style, the photographer must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act differently.
**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**
Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces, or you can take the photo from a higher position.
**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**
People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They might become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting they fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture. This can make people tense. Most people will agree to be photographed, even if they protest at first. They might become self-conscious, so you may need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the person is looking away from the camera.
**D. EYE CONTACT**
A photo is more powerful if the person looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they do not have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and the viewer can see what they are looking at. Candid shots are interesting, and the person's expression is important.
**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about the person in the photo. A laughing child makes us smile, while a sad face makes us feel sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal language.
**G. SITUATION INTEREST**
Photos that show a person with their background can be more interesting. Make sure the background adds to the photo and does not distract from the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person stand out.
**H. INTERACTION**
When people are talking, arguing, or working together, there are chances for good photos. Pictures of couples, mothers and babies, or teams can be appealing. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture how one person reacts to another.
**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**
Many photos of people are taken on holiday to show the places they visit. To do this well, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera so they do not block the background. A slightly higher camera position can help. A good photo balances the people and the place.
**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose with a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all formal poses. Candid photos of events are more lively. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about Sarah and her work.
Sarah Janson is different from many artists because she doesn't sign her work unless someone asks her to. She believes the art is more important than the artist. Sarah is very humble and sometimes acts like her paintings create themselves. She doesn't like to talk about herself and feels shy about being photographed.
Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she wasn't happy with illustration, so she joined a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to try trompe-l'oeil, and she loved it. She decided to start her own business, even though she wasn't sure where it would lead.
Sarah's skills in observing details, learned from illustrating, are important for trompe-l'oeil. She says you can't be taught trompe-l'oeil; it's about observing life. She believes she is still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well stop.""
Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, like not being able to paint bread well. She also struggled with math when working on a big project for a chapel ceiling. She often questions herself and talks about her work as if someone else did it.
Sarah's trompe-l'oeil work is very special and stands out from others. Her art is often inspired by architecture. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and created a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to more rooms.
Trompe-l'oeil must first trick you and then keep your interest. Sarah believes it should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients to come up with ideas and says it's important to listen to them. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.
Sarah appreciates her clients and is thankful for those who trust her with their walls. Even though she doesn't like to talk about her talent, she is always busy with work. She says, ""I don't like to shout about myself. Like my work, I am very restrained."" But her work is so interesting that it deserves more attention."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman talks about the 'people skills' needed to succeed in your job.
**A** The way we work is changing. We are now judged not only by how smart we are or our training, but also by how we handle ourselves and others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It can show who will do very well and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs. They are not about doing well in exams. Instead, they focus on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence.
**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, and 'portable skills' are important. Personal qualities are now very important at work. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it means just 'being nice', but it can also mean telling someone the hard truth. It is about managing feelings so people can work well together.
**C** More businesses see emotional intelligence as important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. Some people succeed without it, but as work becomes more team-based, companies that work well together do better. Emotional intelligence is becoming essential for success in every job around the world.
**D** Unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. Studies show people get better at handling emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned and added to our skills. This is important when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but ignoring it can make things harder."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed how people share these photos. News often appears first on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images of fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have used these images without asking for permission. There is a rule that says images on social media can be used without permission if there is a strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, so user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people are rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
**Acupuncture's Origins and Use**
Acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese medicine and is over 2,000 years old. It includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is mainly known in the West for treating pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it to help with pain relief.
**Understanding Acupuncture**
In traditional Chinese medicine, health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit is balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), moves through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to internal organs. If Qi is blocked or weak, it can cause illness. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulse, tongue, and overall appearance to find where Qi is unbalanced. They ask about your health, mood, and habits. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin to help Qi flow better. Sometimes, warmth or pressure is also used.
**Acupuncture Points**
The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the pain area. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This shows the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 main points on the meridians.
**Scientific Views**
Western doctors have found scientific reasons for acupuncture's pain relief. They suggest it might block pain signals to the brain or release natural pain-relieving substances called endorphins.
**Types of Pain Treated**
Acupuncture is often used for long-term pain like back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and post-surgery pain. It is also used for menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**Modern Use**
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia in surgery began in the 1950s. This convinced some Western doctors of its effectiveness. In China, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia.
**Effectiveness**
Clinical trials for acupuncture are hard to conduct, but some show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree it doesn't work for everyone, and results vary. Relief usually takes six to seven visits, but some improvement can be felt after two or three visits.
**Different Views on Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They consider external factors like weather and the type of pain to decide on treatment. This approach is different from that of most Western doctors.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others use scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe their method leads to longer-lasting cures. It's important to choose a qualified acupuncturist who can refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems very confident, like a headmistress, but she is actually shy. Her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is a bit like her. He likes to solve crimes alone, and she likes to write alone too. She needs privacy to write. P.D. James is very humble and does not agree that she is Britain's most famous crime writer, even though her 12 detective novels are loved by many people worldwide. She enjoys reading books by her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes as Barbara Vine, and other women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner. She also likes male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.
P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband, Connor Bantry White, there. He was a student, and she loved Cambridge, which is why she set her book ""An Unsuitable Job For A Woman"" there. Her life was difficult at times. Her husband returned from World War II very sick, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped a lot by taking care of the children.
She worked full-time for the National Health Service and later at the Home Office. She was involved in forensic science and juvenile crime. She got used to seeing dead bodies but was more interested in writing crime novels. She liked the structure of crime stories and always wanted to be a writer. She didn't want to use her own life's sad events in her books. Writing detective stories was a way to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime in a story shows that life is important, even if the person is not nice. She believes nobody really likes violence."
CAE_5,C1,"'The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a sample of your handwriting. Your handwriting could help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help show certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional problems. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and in job interviews. Many big companies now hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of people applying for important jobs. But most doctors and psychiatrists are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting shows social class and intelligence. It can also assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a devious or open character.' According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, mostly poorly-shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have stopped emotional development. This often shows in childish handwriting and going over letters several times. I can tell if people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.' 'Young male offenders often have very high ascenders, showing they live in a world of fantasy and dream of success. Graphologists can tell if violence is about to happen, if the writer is under a lot of pressure, and if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can predict possible suicides.' Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, that could mean something serious has happened.' A big emotional upset can also show in a temporarily changed signature, she says. Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. People with writing where letters form 'threads' instead of being separate are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves. Very light pressure shows sensitivity and lack of energy. Originality in handwriting - how much the writer has changed from standard script - shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures show inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word shows intolerance and a patronising attitude. Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyse handwriting accurately, and this needs empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. This will happen soon, she believes. 'It's more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer wrongly.' Although this sounds interesting, there is little strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is a product of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught - and has no other meaning.'"
CAE_41,C1,"'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy, healthy team, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open to the street. The team of seven people seems happy and adapts to the seasons by opening doors and using electric heaters, like at home. They have created a friendly work environment without much outside control.
Ergonomist: The furniture is mismatched and often causes bad posture. Chairs are old, not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the team has a varied work schedule, which helps prevent tiredness and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. The office is the right size for knowing what others are doing but also having personal space. It is both efficient and creative.
Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and the air quality is good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the layout could be better. The office is impersonal with grey walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for planners and a maternity rights poster. Staff relationships are okay, but desk positions could be improved for better information sharing.
Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office feels like a glass case. Despite smokers, the air is not stale. You can't smell smoke even close to a smoker.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements. Computer setups are outdated.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and have good technology. The office is busy, but the wood paneling and brown carpet make it look dull.
Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: The building has poor air-conditioning and is cluttered and dusty. The roof collects dust, which falls on people below.
Ergonomist: The furniture is more suited for a workshop. Chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially shorter people. Many chairs are old and not adjustable.
Occupational Psychologist: The office is dirty with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. Few conversations were happening; everyone seemed stressed. The company should encourage teamwork.'"
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million pieces every day. It started as an old custom and is now a big business. Each piece of gum has less than ten calories, but it is considered a food. This means it must meet the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. 
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. But this wasn't always true. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. 
In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians in New England to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States could buy spruce lumps for chewing, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, growing sapodilla trees commercially has not worked. As the gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were needed. 
Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a hard and dangerous job. They walk long distances in very humid conditions to collect sapodilla. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly is especially troublesome because it lays eggs in the tappers' ears and nose. Despite these risks, chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap. They carry the liquid to a camp where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is tough, with a simple diet and local alcohol made from sugar cane.
Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. The United States used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetics to cut costs and meet demand.
Gum producers are also finding new ways to market their products. They claim gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms and causes decay. Saliva neutralizes the acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural help. Also, 137 square kilometers of America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**C. Mauritius - Beachcomber Paradis Hotel**  
The Paradis Hotel is on a quiet peninsula in south-west Mauritius. The road to the hotel passes empty beaches. The hotel is not small, and many people enjoy the free watersports. However, you can find peace on the nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone leaves, you feel far from everything.

The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue. Sue whispers, 'Very poor.' This is a common mistake she has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide. But Sue is not impressed. The entrance from the car park is through a door with a buzzer and a long, empty corridor. 'Not what I expected,' says Sue. Things get worse when the receptionist says they have no record of Sue's booking. Most rooms are empty, but the one they offer is not good. It is stuffy, and there is a hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. Sue was known as 'The Woman in Black' for being tough, but she says she is not too tough. The next morning, after paying, she tells the manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks worried. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that room. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the hotel for five months and hopes Sue's feedback will help. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks how to get three rosettes. Sue says, 'Don't serve a pudding that collapses.' Sue's job is to say what other guests might not. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served apple pie with his fingers. Sue writes a report for the hotel after her visit. Hotels pay to be in the guide, so they want to improve. The good news for Greaves is that Sue will not recommend taking away the red stars. But another inspector will come in two months to check again. 'Good,' says Greaves, trying to smile.'"

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
I was in a snow cave near the top of Mt. Everest with my climbing partner, Dougal Haston. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, which I thought was strange. I realized it was because of the lack of oxygen. I also started talking to my feet because they were getting cold. I remembered other climbers who had lost fingers and toes to frostbite. I wasn't worried about surviving, but about how well we would survive. Over the next two days, I thought about our time on the summit ridge. I felt lucky to be climbing with Dougal, who gave me confidence. I knew I needed a better rhythm to reach the summit, and I did.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
This mountain is considered very dangerous. In April 1976, Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, we realized how big our task was. We followed an old route at first, but then took a new path to the summit. We climbed 'alpine style', carrying everything on our backs. It was the first time a new route was climbed this way. We camped under a cliff, and by the third day, my sleeping bag was wet. We spent the night on a windy ridge and felt like we were at a higher altitude than we were. We finally reached the summit and came down the other side, feeling triumphant.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I went to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. We got a free ride to Kilimanjaro and decided to climb it instead. We got lost in the jungle on the lower slopes and were worried because there was little water. On the second day, we found arrows on trees and a trail of rubbish that led us to a rock pool. We were happy to find water. We tried to climb a steep ice wall but had to turn back because of falling rocks and ice. We took a different route to reach the summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
The usual route up Aconcagua is like a walk. In January 1992, I went there with my wife, Sharu. We met a guide, Phil Erscheler, who suggested we join his group on a different route. After waiting for the weather to improve, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier was icy, and we decided to take the standard route instead. We reached the summit just before dark. Back at base camp, we met climbers from the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and encouraged me to do the same.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
I realized I could climb Vinson Massif by guiding enough people to cover the costs. Our team left Britain in November 1992 and traveled to the South Pole. The sun was always up, and the air was clean. On December 7, we left camp for the summit. Despite strong winds and cold temperatures, we reached the top in 8 hours. The storm made it hard to see, but we were happy to succeed.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
Our team met in St Petersburg in early summer 1994. At Terskol, near Elbrus, we had to pay a fee for bringing foreigners, but it was later waived. After acclimatizing, we took a cableway to 3,900m and walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, we crossed icy slopes and thought we reached the summit, but there was another ridge to climb. We returned to the refuge at night and descended the next day.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
On our trip to Carstensz, we wanted to find a new route and spend time with the Dani people. The mountain has a large gold mine, which is sacred to the local tribes. We were warned about bandits but continued our journey. On May 12, we started climbing. The weather improved, and two team members went ahead. We reached the summit by 11 am. I received applause for completing my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like guest preferences, he uses a computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them next time. The system remembers guest preferences.
Room temperature is important for comfort. Guests can change the temperature in their room a little, but the front desk can adjust it more if needed. Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing tool. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by adding extra cables and renting TVs, so they can be updated easily.
The hotel has 145 large, comfortable rooms. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food is excellent, thanks to Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose restaurant has two Michelin stars. Moving his restaurant to the hotel has been good for both him and the hotel.
With modern technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to be successful."
FCE_24,B2,"'An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden around her house gives her many subjects to paint. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread everywhere. There is a nice mix of colors, shapes, and structures in the two long flower borders along the path in the garden. This is partly because of the previous owners who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also got the gardener, Danny, from them. 'Actually, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got along well. At first, he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" about some things I wanted to plant, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.' Susan likes to focus on detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden, though sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are. Usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't set everything up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer, when the tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. But she also finds the way flowers decay interesting. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day and they each form different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.' Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I studied botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't very interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like fake ones made of silk or plastic sold in some shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was fascinated by how they managed to grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Today, the garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem at home in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude to the garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious damage. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and many subjects to paint right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been hard recently. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.'"
FCE_13,B2,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the big storms in March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. This changed how the town center looked, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been upset too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time. When he first felt a headache and chest pain, his wife, Molly, told him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forgetful and short-tempered. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. He was too weak to argue. Soon, he was getting his medicine and going home to his wife, who sent him to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, but he couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. By Saturday, the medicine worked, his fever went down, and he got up. He was shocked to see the walnut tree was gone, which changed how the living room looked. The Pelhams' big house had a large garden. It was expensive, but Pelham was happy they bought it. The garden made it feel private. But now, the storm changed things. Before, the walnut tree was part of the view from the living room. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it made nice light patterns that hid the old furniture they brought from their last house. Without the tree, the room was very bright, showing the old furniture clearly. The view from the window was now of the tall house next door, which was ugly with purple bricks and pipes. It had many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. 'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. 'I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.'"
FCE_16,B2,"'Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient but not a big problem. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams built many years ago. Soon the snow started to melt. Every day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and getting close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down. Many times before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, all is well; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with just a little overflow sometimes. We can enjoy, not fear, the big clouds over the valley, and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure.'"
FCE_21,B2,"'Film Critic Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviewing - novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his staff. At first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. There would be a weekly lunch where we would choose from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, and there would also be guests to make it sociable. It all felt like a dream at that time: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. In fact, the first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page with one of my reviews, I didn't know where to look. Tom's original plan for a team of critics for the arts never happened. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, we wouldn't have come up with the present arrangement, where I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn't have been interested in the more standard film critic's role, which involves reviewing every film that comes out. That's a routine that would make me tired quickly. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What bad film must I watch now?' - a style of sigh that can often be heard in screening rooms around the world. The space I am given allows me to broaden my argument - or forces me, in a boring week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to see based on the stars, the publicity, or the director. There is also such a thing as loyalty to 'type' or its opposite. It can only rarely happen that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story fan avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be.'"
FCE_46,B2,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a love for endurance sports WANTED: Sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Chance to train with a potential Olympic champion. Must enjoy distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (enjoying 100km rides is an advantage). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are fascinated (and shocked) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 10km without stopping. It's exciting for those watching, but why do triathletes want to push their bodies so hard? And why would a 17-year-old girl with excellent grades give up everything for this challenging sport? Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge, and higher goals that most athletes use. ""You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't win. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her tough training sessions have made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus end? Melanie has tried other events. She has tried the triathlon ""sprint,"" for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,B2,"'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about the things she collects and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults enjoys this hobby too. It is a world of passion and excitement. But remember, if you do not love an object, do not collect it. Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked their shapes and colors. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty. I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. My parents took me to a local museum full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. Many adults share this passion for collecting. People collect for different reasons. Some feel it is the only part of their lives they can control. For me, it's just something I enjoy. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with coconut shell cups, carved ivory beads, and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You do not have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I remember convincing another tulip collector to give me one I wanted. I planted it, but one year it was stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for them. This collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I am not sure which made me sadder! I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet gives value to items traded in markets. As small objects become popular, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now an investment, but only if you kept the original boxes. (I threw them away, along with the toys.)'"
FCE_3,B2,"'My line of work Four people talk about their jobs. Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I read about the subject first and talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure safety. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people. Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers I start work at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents are needed for learning the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, figuring out the best routes. They learn the correct one-way streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route and then tell them they must find another way because the road is closed. The next student must find a third route, and I give a reason why they can't use it. This makes them think. Sarah - Marine Conservationist I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but mostly I am by the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views because it is different from making decisions on a computer. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. The downside is I work for a charity, so we always need more money. I am always looking for more resources and can't do everything I want. Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher My work is varied. I make sure our publishing matches market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design.'"
FCE_10,B2,"'Our Holiday in Ireland We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have added to the building, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds were before they moved from England to Ireland. We think it's quite a coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' She was talking about the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of putting numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband does the redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not for long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man on his own and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window, we could see some of them walking on the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of routine had developed. Since we first came here, we'd all fallen in love with every part of its beautiful landscape.'"
FCE_67,B2,"'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, called chalets, that are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live in the chalet. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the guests finish breakfast, by about 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea, which is left for the guests, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's bad if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are happy to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week great - breakfast this morning was fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A terrible day,' she says, 'when you don't want to be cooking breakfast with a bad headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests leave, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just clean everything - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. '"
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen, a very small girl with pale skin, visited Seymour's factory one day. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was six years older. Rita wore overalls and big shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by curly hair. Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 
A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class, who had visited the factory years ago. Seymour had shown them how he made gloves, especially Marie's favorite part, the laying-off table. Here, the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking flat. As a child, Marie called them the 'pancake hands'.
Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' Rita said, 'Not yet.' Seymour offered, 'I'll set that up for you if you'd like. They're old-fashioned places. The technology has improved, but it's not much different from hundreds of years ago. It's hard work. Tanning is said to be the oldest industry, with remains found in Turkey, I believe, from six thousand years ago. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for two days. Glovemen love the trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' Rita replied, 'I can't say I have. I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' Seymour laughed. Rita made him laugh. She was eager to learn, like his daughter Marie, who was taller and fairer than Rita but had the same good-natured intelligence. 
Seymour decided, 'I'll show you the whole process. Come on. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"

She can't meet us tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help calm me down,' she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so closed in with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork - organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel plans. She didn't apply for the job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance, which led to a job offer. She took a secretarial course at night school at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, a person who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he liked being a caddy more. Well, you would too if golf was your passion. There were some downsides though. A small flat fee is given, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that is spent on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recently recognized by European Tour Productions when they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he collects and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try food in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' His talent as a cook led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his weight under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing was mainly poetry. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's notes - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'"

In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were made into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles covered the yard down to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof onto the sawdust. He lay there laughing and said, ""I dare you all! You're all cowards."" He watched them from the roof, looking scared, but one by one, they jumped and got up smiling. In the hot sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one boy said, ""Let's go up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and jumped off again, except for Michael. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the roof, nervous and smiling awkwardly. It seemed like a longer drop this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but it didn't work. The boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we'll wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they walked away, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun set over the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, and fell onto the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The workmen had gone home, and the yard was quiet. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to come home on time. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled anger, but Michael, feeling gloomy, hardly heard her. He was still thinking about the boys laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy with your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change jobs are turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a short history of yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a summary with career suggestions and possible retraining options.
I decided to try Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. I had to remember it wasn't about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the tests, I talked with an adviser who gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of his conclusions, though I was surprised to learn I did poorly in scientific and technical tests. I was glad to hear I made the right choice with journalism.
Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends suggested Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to look at my career and skills,' says Donna. Some results surprised her. 'I didn't know I had a talent for design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining,' she says. Other ideas included working in the Far East for a year. 'I used my skills to find a job better suited to me. Now, I work as a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped me see what I wanted to do. I've recommended them to friends who are happy with the service.'
Some people feel they couldn't have made changes without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services helped 26-year-old Juliet Greene make big decisions. 'After six years at a bank, I found my job boring and needed a new challenge. I didn't know what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree this year. The advice was worth the fee. I'm much happier and more positive now.'
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I didn't know where to go in my career. I hoped a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary drop or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt a friend could have given me similar advice.'"
FCE_22,B2,"'Fun at the Dentist's? If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they're in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. That's because they're scared.' To change this, he has tried to make a place where people are not afraid. That's why I decided not to wear a white coat. I think that's something people connect with pain. My idea is that dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and fun atmosphere.' This is surprising for many of us who think dental visits mean pain or at least formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget past bad experiences.' Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new ways to help people relax. 'We were the first in Britain to use them and they're very popular. The headsets are used for the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset shows a special camera view, giving the patient a tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit. Another important thing is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today it smells like orange. Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to know with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell can make your heart race if you're scared of dentists.' I found the nice smell in the office very pleasant. Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome wants to say that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all. Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. 'One thing I learned there was that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself,' he explains. He sees his patient-focused attitude as the start of a slow change towards less formality in the traditional British dentistry profession. At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a regular dental practice.'"

FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and has become very skilled in his art. He still wants to try new things like paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on making beautiful and unique objects from shells. As he shows me his work in his apartment, he says, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" However, he is not boring at all; he is very enthusiastic and charming, and his creations are beautiful.
He shows me some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace and says he doesn't mind if people don't buy them because he loves them. He never planned to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. Five years ago, he had an exhibition in London, and 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened, and the pieces are quite expensive, with some costing around £2,000.
There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke says he doesn't set the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else in the world makes work like his, and the gallery owner told him that one day everyone will want his pieces because he will stop making them.
Cooke wishes he had started this art earlier in life because he feels he could have created even more wonderful things. Although he still has many ideas, he finds himself more physically limited now. Despite this, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. He creates boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers.
Cooke has developed his own method and uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says his work seems to create itself, but the detail and symmetry show it is not accidental.
His search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming beaches. He says that people walking on the beach destroy shells faster than he can collect them, and the sea breaks them up too. He would never collect shells with living creatures inside or dive for them. He believes that collecting empty shells is not harmful, and his work turns them into something even more beautiful."
FCE_62,B2,"'The Schoolgirl Model When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, you will probably find her studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were not true, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions. But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking very young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which is understandable since it was not planned. It was her older sister who decided that she should enter the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become used to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I have too high an opinion of myself.' This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a bad way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.' As a busy model, though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us"".' Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.' '"
FCE_49,B2,"**Father and Son Search for Gold**
Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in Wales, they believe they are close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, said, ""We are finding a lot of gold as we dig; we just need to go a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""
The Maddens have spent their lives looking for gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to find the best place to dig. After clearing the land and finding small pieces of gold, they spent ten years getting permission to dig, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it seems difficult, but we have some people we can ask.""
As news of their dig spread, people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and locals are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, more people might visit, but I hope not too many come and dig up the hillside.""
The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed recently. However, some people are still looking for gold. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. Hall, who is 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, like finding hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"'IN HOT WATER Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, like a tiny car, and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside, space is so small that she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, where they can't stand or move, and must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive can last 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is a problem, they can press a panic button. The outside part drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that quickly goes to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it wouldn't be a pleasant trip. The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was on a ship's deck with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, like what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a place five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. On the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment there to study the effect of a program that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano. When not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves, but she does it to continue her research on the ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at one meter per second and at 350 degrees. The only time Rachel was scared was when she first went down with the Americans. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was an explosion. There was a loud bang as shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive. Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees those chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen them before. She studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD. Seeing them for real was an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind couldn't handle more foreign timetables, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. I just needed to buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train's movement helps you sleep deeply. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply. You might even burn socks that smell bad or throw away books when you're done with them. This way of thinking is part of the Inter-Rail spirit. You can forget about common sense and just enjoy the freedom. All you need is one of those tickets. This train ticket lets young people travel through many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our camp-site in southern France. But we couldn't resist traveling more because there was always another country nearby. And it didn't cost us extra. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, like most other Inter-Railers. We made our own plans and only saw the easiest sights. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I saw was the view from the station. We were there to enjoy ourselves. We were like other Inter-Railers, sharing train floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. It's like the city didn't exist until you arrived and saw it with your own eyes. Only by seeing Europe, watching the landscapes change, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles, can you really understand the continent. Everyone knows what's there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. That's why other people's holiday photos are boring. The train trip won't show you anything new in the world, but it's a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to see this, though we didn't realize it right away."
FCE_37,B2,"'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your baggage is not there. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it is common for regular travelers to lose their luggage at some point. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes. 
Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, the system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause the baggage system to fail. Human error or accidents, like a torn destination label, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.
To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,B2,"'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, shading the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, mud browns, and different yellows of sunlight. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light. It disappears in a second, but the image stays in your mind. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He cannot explain exactly why he loves this little bird so much. In Greek myth, the kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this. Kingfishers have no blue pigment in their feathers. The structure of their feathers reflects light and looks blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or green, depending on the light. Many wildlife photographers love them. Kingfishers are shy but can be watched from a hideout. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in minutes and sat very close. But it took him four years to get his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became very important in his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream with many kingfishers. School was a problem because it took time away from the birds. He missed lessons and did not do well in school. But people noticed his interest in the kingfisher, the only one of its family to breed in Europe. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and later became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the best kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images,' he says. 'I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings...' He stops, thinking of the bird's colors. His photos show his feelings, but he knows there is more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show.'"
FCE_68,B2,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**
**A. ANNE MANSON**
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected start in conducting. She asked to watch Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna and ended up replacing an absent assistant. This led to more opportunities, and she wasn't nervous about leading her first rehearsal. Manson, originally from America, works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in Europe, helped by the British Arts Council. She has worked with Abbado on several projects since then.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of conducting is convincing people to give you chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after failing in two others. He believes the timing was perfect, as earlier success might have been overwhelming. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition. He hopes orchestras, like the English Chamber Orchestra, will continue to invite him back, as this is crucial for his career.
**C. WASFI KANI**
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods in opera. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional. Learning from Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. Seeing someone her size conduct was inspiring. She appreciates the complexity of opera, including dealing with singers' personalities.
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly fascinating. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, which was easier than he expected. He knew the music well and aimed to achieve the performance he wanted. His musical experience has been valuable, and he is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys.
**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**
In 1986, Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, then a young assistant conductor, and recommended him. Marshall, now 32, soon conducted a musical in London on short notice, facing challenges like musicians reading newspapers during the show. He was firm with them, always giving a clear beat. He believes many musicians don't need much guidance but isn't afraid to express his wishes. Although he hasn't formally studied conducting, he is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,B2,"**Theme Park Reviews**
If you want to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. But we were surprised! The park is great for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay longer. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, including adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**
After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with its exciting trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small. The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, a staff member offered to sit with one of my daughters when I couldn't.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**
We arrived at 1 p.m. and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited 30 minutes for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't try the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children were older, they might find it a bit tame, but they loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**
The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary, but Ben loved it. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were mixed; some were great with young kids, but not all were friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't tell the kids we were leaving early!"
FCE_60,B2,"'Running a business in the countryside Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside. A. 'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business. She earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted a job I could do from home. I had worked with computers before, so my husband suggested starting a computer-aided design business. It needed a lot of money, and it was hard at first. But I was careful with money and always informed the bank if I might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. It is still a small business. We rarely deliver work; local people usually pick it up.' B. 'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who designs greeting cards from home. 'I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where there were no such jobs. So, I started my own business and created 50 greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. My business grows by word of mouth—I don't advertise. People send work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone means I don't share ideas with others, but there are more benefits than drawbacks.' C. 'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, who makes curtains. 'I started my business eight years ago. At first, the business grew, and my earnings went from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. I used to have six full-time workers. But I had to let them go because the economy got worse, which was hard because jobs are scarce here. Now, I am almost back to the start, making curtains at home with my husband's help and using women who work from their homes. I have to be ready to lower my prices when needed and look for new opportunities.' D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. First, because London was too expensive, and second, because I love the countryside. I like working when I want. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The downside is that it takes discipline to stop working. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. All my work experience was in London, so I felt very alone at first.' E. MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop, earning £250,000 a year and employing six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I began making fruit cakes with good quality flour and eggs. Then friends and family started asking for them, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building, and everything is made there now—we have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don't bake anymore; I manage the business side. My biggest challenge has been the financial side because we didn't have a lot of money to start with.'"
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons, Paul and Huw, are talented musicians and composers, and their father, John, makes musical instruments. 
When Paul was ten years old, he needed a cello. John and Hetty, his parents, found that buying one was too expensive. So, John decided to learn how to make one himself. He attended evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, John made his first cello for Paul. It was so good that Paul used it for many years.
John eventually left his teaching job to become a full-time instrument maker. He now makes about twelve violins a year. One of his violins was even bought by the famous American musician Jaime Laredo.
Both Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano and then chose the cello because he admired a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, on the other hand, decided to play the piano and compose music. He was inspired by Paul's success but was never pushed by his parents.
Paul achieved great success with the cello his father made. He won the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the age of 20. Recently, he started playing a very old and valuable cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul will soon perform on television with this cello, but he won't be able to watch it because he has a concert the same night. Huw also has a performance that evening, as his String Quartet will be played in London for the first time.
John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with their sons' busy musical schedules."
FCE_53,B2,"'Looking after the countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is an organization that works to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. Gareth says a warden needs common sense and must be good with people because they work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the warden job, but Gareth got it because he knew the area well and had farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. He still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. His farming background also helps him with the physical work like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes now that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault because they followed government advice. When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists disagreed, but now they talk and understand each other better. Conservation is a big part of Gareth's job, along with allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He likes seeing projects finished, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork. Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to the public, but some people annoy him when they act like they own the place. If you have common sense and like outdoor work, you might want to be a warden like Gareth, but don't expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula soon!'"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her days are busy with teaching at a local school and training in a supermarket car park. I asked her if people look at her strangely. She said, ""I'm too focused on my movements to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""
Kendra's life is all about being her best for the Championships. She follows a strict plan to be very fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and 27 nations will join. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. A home crowd will expect us to start well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""We have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of ability."" England is ranked fourth in the world. The World Championships are tough. ""You play every day with no rest. You only have one chance to win.""
In her 15 years at the top level, netball has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. ""You train to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the game, we're all friendlier.""
Netball now uses a scientific approach to fitness. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and must lead by example. I support and encourage my team.""
Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned. She decided this competition will be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she focuses on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,B2,"**Specialist Music Schools**
How can parents help a child with great musical talent? It is not always easy to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. Most schools can help children who are good at academic subjects, but musically talented children need special support that regular schools might not offer, especially if music is not a main focus.
Children with musical talent, encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school. There are five such schools in Britain. These schools provide a supportive environment for children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one-third to half of their day on music activities like lessons, orchestras, and music theory. They also practice for several hours a day in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, science, and languages. Students can study more subjects if they want.
All five British specialist music schools are independent, with small classes and many teachers. Most students live at the school, which means they spend a lot of time with others who have similar interests. 
What are the disadvantages? One problem is the cost; fees are high (£12,000-£17,000 a year for boarders). However, schools try to help parents with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. School directors often question if it is good to admit children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They aim to help children become well-rounded individuals.
There is a risk that separating musically talented children early can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a feeling of failure. But specialist schools monitor students closely and offer help if needed. Many former students feel they gained a lot from the music teaching, but some worry about the limited academic program. Many musically talented children are also smart and can handle academic challenges, so they might feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.
For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves about specialist education. Children who are also good academically might do well in a regular school with a strong music program or by combining regular school with music training at a music college. These colleges offer Saturday lessons and music experiences, but this option is not possible for families far from major cities."
FCE_25,B2,"'An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread everywhere. The garden has a nice mix of colors and shapes, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan likes. She also got the gardener, Danny, from them. 'It was really his garden,' she says. 'We got along well. At first, he didn't agree with some of my ideas, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood.' Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't set everything up at once,' she says. 'I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then I add another one.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She also likes watching them change as they age. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day. Susan has always loved plants. 'I studied botany at school and collected wildflowers,' she says. 'I didn't like garden flowers then; I thought they looked fake. I liked wildflowers because they grew in difficult places.' Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit well in her garden. She lets the garden grow freely, like an aunt who lets children play as long as they don't cause harm. With two exhibitions coming up, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She has hired another gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_34,B2,"**Keeping the Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year doing this job. People call her ""Pilch."" She works for a company that takes care of visitors who come to ski. These visitors stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She graduated last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it's a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more serious job. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then prepares breakfast for the guests. They get porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the worst part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. She skis as much as she can. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.""
Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower before cooking but does not sleep. ""It's bad if you do,"" she says. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and loads the dishwasher. ""I don't like coming to a messy kitchen in the morning."" Sometimes she talks with the guests, other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks are not as good.""
Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start at Bananas, then maybe go to G Jay's, and end at Dick's T-Bar,"" she says. But she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she says. ""You don't want to cook breakfast when you're tired.""
On Sunday, work starts earlier. Breakfast for guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything, clear breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready."" If she hasn't shopped on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for new guests. ""They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. I think it's the mountain air.""
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis. She takes them to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it's time for dinner again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she says."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day at the magazine Marie Claire. 'Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed - my job isn't like that. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.'
Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo. 'I arrived at the zoo in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad but had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.'
Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went with the TV gardening programme Ground Force. 'I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, I don't see daylight because of my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my job.'
Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked at Hammersmith Hospital. 'I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I would faint, but I was okay. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is a waste of time compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.'
Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with Ryanair as cabin crew. 'I changed into the uniform, and I felt different - people looked up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one adult to look after.'
Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent the day as a personal trainer in a gym. 'I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier.''"

A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit often. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past amazing sea views. It doesn't matter what the weather is like or the time of year, it is always beautiful. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. You feel like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively because there is a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey. Raj Patel - Explorer I have enjoyed many rail journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park. I was considered too young and was sent to an aunt. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me. Betty Cooper - Novelist I am grateful to one train: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I've worn it ever since. What I remember about the journey is how nice it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding. Martin Brown - Journalist We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We heard the driver would wait for days if he knew people were coming. When it appeared, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriages - people even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed beautiful landscapes. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon. Arisu Mezuki - Actress Most people have favorite train memories from childhood, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important to me. I made a film with a railway in Yorkshire. Most filming was on an old line maintained by volunteers. That's where my love for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train, and when I went back last year, it was like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!'"
FCE_8,B2,"'Want to get published? If you are thinking about where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Readers of this magazine often ask, 'I have written this story/book. Who should I send it to?' The first thing they need to know is that they should research their markets and learn about publishers while improving their writing skills. Selling your writing takes a lot of knowledge about the 'writing world'. Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to know about the markets you are aiming for. The best way to do this is by reading everything you can find. Use your local library and visit local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are accepting at any time. This knowledge must be updated as new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go all the time. Publishers always want new writers; as writers, we must give them what they want. At first, you may not be sure what you want to write. Let's say you want to write short love stories. The first thing you must do is find out which magazines publish love stories, and get as many recent copies as you can. Then learn about the kind of stories they are buying and who the readers are. These readers expect different things from their magazine, and the editor wants to meet their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?' As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is ready to be published; so I try to give an honest opinion, but always positively. The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually before they are ready. If you have only written one story or article, it is not likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about 'success', you usually find that the person has been in publishing or journalism for years before their success. When you send off your work for the first time, start working on more stories while you wait for a reply; write ten more stories, even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to think of yourself as a writer, and your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any of them away - improve them instead. Also, I advise not showing your work to anyone else, especially in the early stages. Remember that every successful writer has had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See if there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing - every day if possible.'"

On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore railway station. I was waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station didn't feel as clean and airy as usual. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. 
A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question, then went to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" 
She said, ""I'm going north, but to New York."" He thanked her and moved on. Now, I was interested. I heard him ask an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Wilmington,"" and he moved on to another couple. 
I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me. Maybe I looked unreliable. He glanced at me and went to another bench. He looked stressed. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" 
She said, ""Yes, I am."" 
""Could I ask you a favor?"" he asked. I pretended to check my watch, even though I didn't have one. The woman seemed cautious. The man said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 
They announced my train. People started moving to Gate E. I heard the man say, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. She forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn't know what to do."" 
The woman listened. I would have waited to see what he wanted. ""I told her to stay there, and I would find someone to bring her passport."" 
Why didn't he go himself? The woman asked, ""Why don't you go yourself?"" 
""I can't leave my wife alone. She's in a wheelchair,"" he said. This seemed like a weak excuse. I looked at them. The man held a padded envelope, not a plain one. It looked stapled shut. I thought, ""Be careful, lady."""

John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary's chance was cooking, and John's chance was running a restaurant. When John found the restaurant, it was in bad condition, but he thought it was perfect for his plans. This reminded him of his childhood when his mother worked in a factory, and he was left alone. He wanted to have time for family life, so his wife took care of the children and did the accounts while he ran the business. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together, which helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, Gary and Joe talked to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.
Gary was a lively child. Once, when he was seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he worked for pocket money, starting with odd jobs and then working in the kitchen every weekend by the age of ten. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. Gary wasn't very academic, but he was excellent in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the men working there and sometimes was in charge, making over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would go into catering because he had a talent for it. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend's restaurant.
Gary recently started playing the drums and has his own band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. He advises Gary to focus on one thing, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John told Gary that he needed to succeed by the age of 30. Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he finished a morning's work in an hour and helped others. John is very proud of Gary's successful TV cookery series. He always told Gary that if you want something, you have to work hard for it. Gary has taken his opportunity and succeeded. John is happy that Gary listened to some of his advice."

But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no personal contacts, no one to tell you about a vacant place. So, you had to stay in a hostel and search. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going. Everyone at her school assumed she would leave. Who would stay in a small, boring town? That's all she heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, see life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family would help them settle. But none from Jo's year were going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because hostels were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were still thinking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a queue because it was more 'Third Girl Wanted' than 'Flat to Let'. The 'own television' part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who was obviously not chosen, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Pauline was a punk, which amazed Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called.' Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said 'Nessa', one said 'Pauline', and the other said 'Other'.

FCE_43,B2,"'Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We like to see them in seaside marinas, films, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are disappearing. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think dolphins are protected by law and live in safe marine areas. But this is not true, and not helping them could be a big wildlife problem. There are forty kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. The first two live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups. We know little about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few left have skin injuries, showing they are stressed. Dolphins have complex habits, making it hard to know why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which reduces fish stocks and threatens fishing industries, also threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are taken by fishing, they may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses big nets that float or move fast through the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornwall beaches. Marks and cuts show they died from being caught in nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them. These poisons can pass to their young through milk. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Another big threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This noise may disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet know.'"
FCE_51,B2,"'GETTING FIT Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels busy and stressful. You might think this is just another article about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise. Exercise is good for you. It makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit correctly, which is called good posture. Good posture prevents muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored, but here are some more reasons to exercise. Exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems. It also helps control stress and can help with some medical conditions. If these reasons don't convince you, common sense should tell you that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. But be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you're unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you. Good posture is important for your body shape. A stiff or slouching body can look unattractive and feel tired. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This will help you stand straighter and breathe better. Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period.'"

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest people to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained almost non-stop for six months, causing many problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive tool so that when their vehicle gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him out. Their teamwork has created some of TV's best wildlife films, like their popular film on leopards. Even while this film was being shown, they were back in the wild, this time following the shy jackal. This is common for TV partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been going around the world to film exotic wildlife since TV began.
I talked to Newman about their partnership while he was briefly meeting other people at a safari lodge. 'We sometimes argue but we get over it quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they both see animals in the same way. 'When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now we have a fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask.' Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a problem,' says Newman. It can be tough, but being alone in remote areas lets them get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a lion family where one lioness would greet their car as part of her routine.
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. Since then, they spend four months on location to get enough material for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We want to make films that are rich in atmosphere, show the true spirit of the place and animals, and touch people's hearts. I believe it's better to make people feel something than just think about it.'"

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a typical day: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'
'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. She follows a strict plan to be very fit. These are her fourth World Championships, with 27 countries taking part. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure. People expect us to start well.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'We have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of skill.'
The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, there's only one chance,' Kendra explains. In her 15 years of playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. 'You train to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we're all friendlier.'
Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, she believes it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. 'I support and encourage the team,' she says.
'From the start, my netball career was carefully planned,' she says. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she focuses on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,B2,"'In hot water Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can touch the two pilots. We can't stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering rock and water samples, and then three hours to return to the surface.' 'If there is a problem and we need to get to the top quickly, we can press a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface. No-one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.' 'I didn't know how I would react the first time I got into the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and I got in with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react in such a small space.' Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with chimneys blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research into the ""black smokers"". This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.' 'The only time I was frightened was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a loud bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 'It's such an adventure diving to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body movement, how fast or slow we talk, our volume and tone of voice, and our words.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best."" Many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""
Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from words, 38% from voice, and 55% from facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job immediately. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't turn him down. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have got more if I had controlled my excitement.""
Finally, what we say and how we say it is important for a successful interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confused sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years, working in the City became boring. I didn't plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn't get much money, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with a top restaurant. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm happy not to be in an office anymore, but I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""
**The Painter**
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. So, I decided to leave my job and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was surprised because most people my age need to work for money. But my wife and I married young, and our children didn't need our support. We moved to the north of England, where we didn't know anyone. We left our friends, but they still visit us.""
**The Hat Maker**
Katherine Goodison was a company lawyer for five years before starting her own business making hats in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and paid well, but the hours were long. I didn't want to work more hours as a senior partner, so I left. Some people thought I would get bored, but I haven't. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there are always new collections and seasons, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss socializing with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's my fault.""
**The Masseur**
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, making deals. I liked the excitement but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I quit and traveled for a year. During that time, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and talked to the owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I feel in control of my life now."""
FCE_6,B2,"'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always loved sports. I tried many different ones, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun there because of the great athletics facilities and nightlife. But I have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to get to the next Olympics - that would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you can't go to late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I love sleeping in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it because, without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I make sure to have a big night out, and if there's prize money, I'll go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a job presenting a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly when we're out, but we don't look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about where we celebrate than how we did in the race. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's great to come back and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can't focus on the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've only been recognized in the street a few times. I'd hate to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from people asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one. It takes time, but it's important to me. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to walk on court and feel the crowd's support. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Still, I enjoy being noticed by fans when I'm out shopping. But it has downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up, I think. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me too much. I'm happy to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport.'"
FCE_33,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this, and I feel guilty about buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when they see fun and exciting ads.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children all the time.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' that's still what they want.""
Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy for their children and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son is critical of ads, and they look at labels together. She says, ""I've talked so much that I've made him think all ads are rubbish. We don't have many arguments in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm in a good mood, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,B2,"**Title: The Merrion Hotel: Luxury and Modern Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was created by turning four large old houses into a modern hotel. This allowed the hotel to include the latest technology for both staff and guests.
The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like guest preferences, he uses a computer system. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them next time. The system remembers guest preferences.
Room temperature is important for comfort. Guests can change the temperature in their room a little, but the front desk can adjust it more if needed. Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that is also a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing tool. The hotel has extra cables for future technology updates. TVs and DVD recorders can be easily upgraded.
Despite all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He has a modern kitchen and better parking. The hotel benefits from having a popular restaurant without financial risk.
With great technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to succeed."
FCE_40,B2,"'Where I get my energy Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to tell us how they do it. A. Jeanette Kupfermann Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I need to do something challenging. If I'm learning something new, I get a lot of energy. Anything with rhythm gives me energy, too - right now I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive, and gives energy. I think you can feel tired if you're bored or feel life has no purpose. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' B. Linda Kelsey Magazine editor: 'I have a lot of work but I enjoy it - I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even if you're tired. I need a lot of sleep, so when I get it, I feel good. When I only get six hours of sleep, I feel a bit down. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to find the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and try to do a workout at home. But if I've done exercise, my mood improves a lot. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's good to eat something then.' C. Annie Nightingale Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives, live in the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You have to achieve things and set goals. I enjoy what I do and the last two years have been very exciting. In my job, there are lots of lively young people and you can't help being affected by that. I love rushing around for work, having a busy life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photos but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them developed and can't wait to see them. I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and it's a good way to relax my mind when I'm traveling.' D. Floella Benjamin Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family, and I think being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids, they give so much and have a natural resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' E. Deborah Moggach Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything is making a garden out of wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I broke all the concrete and added a lot of soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing that someone wants to read what I'm writing - I find it hard to write without an audience. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm found, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' F. Katherine Monblot Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do makes you tired. I used to be a member of various committees and didn't like the demands they made on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for the things that are most important to you.' '"
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists found skates made from animal bones. People used these bone skates until about 200 AD when iron skates came to Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, the upper classes thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was stylish and calm. But at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie showed a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it graceful and physically challenging.
For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to keep your weight centered. Your body should lean a little forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It seems easy, right? As you practice, you can make your movements longer.
Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for skaters. Even the best skaters fall. To fall without getting hurt, try to stay relaxed. This way, the impact is softer. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is to learn figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer lessons to help you learn the basic moves, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.
If you watch good or professional skaters, you will see how relaxed they are and how smoothly they move. To be like them, you should do regular exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises are important. Focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also improves heart and lung health and makes the body stronger. When combined with swimming or jogging, it is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

FCE_29,B2,"'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, at fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows by another centimetre. Every year, more tall people are born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with big changes. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then about 9,000 years ago, farming was invented, with big consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has had a bad effect on human health and body size. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Corn was a public health problem, according to some anthropologists. However, farming spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been addressed, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not changed much. A standard bed-length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to change their products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it this century. However, scientists add one note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller because of better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.'"
FCE_57,B2,"'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV, but many people don't understand them. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Some think studio audiences are not very important. Even people who work in TV sometimes don't respect them. I thought studio audiences were just people wanting to be on TV for a moment. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all backgrounds and jobs. TV tries to get different people for different shows. People who like watching TV at home don't understand why others go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV for a second. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came for a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But most people said they came because a friend gave them a ticket. Few of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', and Charlotte liked being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night out.'"

I don't like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I like villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I cycled to the village of Lastingham. Cycling was a break from school. I loved exploring the hilltops, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in a diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train from Hythe to Dungeness, run by hobbyists. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with sheep and next to a canal. But I love when the train goes through back gardens. We can see people doing everyday things like making tea or washing dishes. I see myself as a woman in a small train, looking into people's homes. I like the ordinary landscape. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closely to find something special.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people. Some brave surfers come, but most people enjoy the sea's beauty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland through valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple accommodation with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open moorland, perfect for hiking. There are not many people living or visiting there. It is an unknown, empty, and remote area. I like the feeling of space. I found it by chance when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

I bought Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to cycle around the moors and village streets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"Title: ANIMAL ADVENTURE
We are a family that loves animals and enjoys having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was excited because she found a pine snake. ""Can we keep it?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals we found, so we could look at them and read about them in our natural history book.
I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, a white mouse I got for Mother's Day. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room. The room was full of furniture and children, and Domino was trying to find a way to enjoy his catch. I tried to help but tripped and fell.
While on the floor, I saw the snake escaping from its tank. It was moving across the floor. The room was chaotic with the cat, mouse, kids, and now the snake. The dog was barking too. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and came back to the room. I managed to catch Domino by the tail and saved the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, the same mouse was caught by the cat three more times but lived a long life.
Feeling confident, I turned my attention to the snake. It was not easy to catch. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, trying to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed, and I carefully picked it up. I took it to the garden and pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would leave. But when I let go of its head, the snake wrapped around my shoulders like a scarf. It seemed to like me because I was warm.
My eldest child, DJ, said, ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" We all helped to gently move the snake towards the tree. It finally climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of its tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"'Write Me a Letter! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old art of letter writing might disappear. But for me, getting a letter is special. There is the excitement when it arrives, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the joy of reading it. I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made me write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote once a week, and so did my mother. Sometimes my father wrote, and his long, funny letters were always a joy to receive. Most letters from home were about everyday events with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. I often had boyfriends who were away for work or study, and we stayed in touch by writing. Instead of hurting the relationships, letter writing seemed to make them better. I found I could express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to have a year's worth of news! It's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters come from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't talked in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would have missed out. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a correspondence could last so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,B2,"Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**
Many old pictures carved into rocks in France are being destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego, in the French Alps, are being damaged quickly. These drawings are 4,000 years old and show cows with horns, fields, and gods. The mountain was once a place for prayer. As more people visit, the pictures are being ruined by graffiti. Jean Clottes, from the International Committee on Rock Art, says, 'People think the pictures will always be there, but if the damage continues, they will be gone in 50 years.' He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and even taking pieces home. Some visitors rub the drawings to take better photos, which damages them. Others scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.
Experts disagree on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way is to stop people from visiting, except on guided tours. He says this will save the site and help research. Clottes disagrees, saying this will upset local people. He believes they should do everything possible to save the site. David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says the area is too big to stop all damage, and they don't have enough money for guards. They might need to charge visitors a fee.
In Nice, Annie Echassoux is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach, more damage will happen. She thinks they should rope off the area and use guides. She says money must be found to protect the site because it is a historic place. If they don't act, the drawings will be lost for future generations."
FCE_32,B2,"'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't buy all this stuff, and I feel guilty if I do. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win.' Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why parents say no to buying things. Arguments about sugar being bad for teeth are not as convincing as the fun and emotional TV ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, 'Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, 'The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, ""Ask your mum to buy this,"" that's still what they want.' Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads, so they don't ask for things she won't buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, 'We say no to sweets because they're bad, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy treats, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on my mood. If I'm happy, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.' Supermarkets could help by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Parents might spend less without their children, but shopping without their demands could attract more customers.'"
FCE_65,B2,"**Going up the wall**
In the past, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, the crowd watches French climber Francois Lombard. He is hanging upside down by two fingers on the climbing wall. The National Indoor Arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, and both events have something in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new technology.
Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they either climbed in cold weather, walked, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. When cliffs were not usable, they used brick or stone buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.
Soon, sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges. Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He used natural rock set in concrete for the wall. Many walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had problems. These walls were only vertical, unlike real cliffs with overhangs and angles. Also, once built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a material shaped like real cliff features. These could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls, but steel frames could be set up anywhere. This system gave climbers many new holds to try."
FCE_61,B2,"'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky'. And yes, acting is a risky career. There are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you are crazy, but others might think differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But it is your choice, and only you can make it happen. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee that you will succeed after your training. It depends on luck and talent. But there is always a need for new faces and talent, and acting can be exciting and glamorous, with the chance of big rewards. People often ask what talent is. I think it is natural skill plus imagination. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain. In the theatre, the important thing is the moment of connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what drives actors to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and techniques, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is the biggest enemy for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Then you get an audition, but you might not get the job. So, actors do not talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of competing for a part and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. And remember, rejection is possible from the first moment you start auditioning. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. And, in many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_28,B2,"'We are all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every ten years, people in Europe grow about one centimeter taller. More tall people are being born each year. This doesn't mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to our size from 40,000 years ago. Back then, people ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. They ate about 85 different wild plants. But 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers took over green areas, and now three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our calories. This poor diet made people less healthy and shorter. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Farming spread because it could support more people, even if they were not well-nourished. Only recently have diets improved in Europe, the US, and Japan. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but it brings problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and leg-room in planes and trains is small. Clothes manufacturers have to change their products. We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller, as a species, we are shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and smaller. If the planet continues to heat up, we might shrink more. So, global warming could stop us from growing taller.'"

FCE_5,B2,"**Two Brothers and Their Childhood Game**
Dave and Norm Lagasse are two brothers in their forties with bushy beards. They live in a simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are playing a game from their childhood called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, who was a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. The family loved playing it on weekends and holidays. When they moved to New Mexico, they continued to play with the board their grandfather made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often curious about the game because it was not known in southern USA.
Three years ago, Dave noticed the old board was damaged and decided to make a new one. It was so nice that a relative and then a friend wanted one too. To see if others were interested, the brothers took a board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people were not interested, but once they tried it, they loved it. Dave researched the game's history and found it might have started in India with a game called 'carroms'. It then became 'squails' in Britain and was brought to Canada by British immigrants. In Quebec, it became known as pichenotte.
Pichenotte is a game of skill for two to four players. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' to flick across a board using one finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole earns 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight small posts make the game more challenging. A game usually lasts two minutes.
Seeing how popular the game was, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. The game became so popular that championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. They sell for $595 on the brothers' website.
There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope their business will grow. They dream of one day having a luxury car in their garage instead of wood and tools. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they love."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a piece of empty land, covered with wild plants. For a long time, people thought it was useless land. But one man, with the help of his wife, turned it into the beautiful place you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the landscape you see now. Machines helped, but a lot of hard work was also needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.
Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted in the Model Village. These plants had to be chosen carefully because they needed to survive the salty air from the sea and strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some came from as far as Canada and New Zealand.
The whole village was designed by Colin Sims. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting when the village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, wood, and plastic to last in all weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how materials would last over time, but he soon became an expert himself.
You will see that the models are all made to the same scale, with great attention to detail. This was done with patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is a popular attraction known for its high-quality work. The techniques used here are now used in other model villages in England and are even taught in some schools.
All the model buildings show traditional British architecture but are not exact copies of real places. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It is based on manor houses from the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini-golf course, which is the newest addition.
Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models; a small mistake can cause hours of repair work. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. To enjoy the Model Village more, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press them to make the models move.
At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. New models are always being planned, and your ideas can help us make the village more interesting. We also want to know if any models need improvement. We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it."
FCE_69,B2,"'Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' rules. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization made to handle these issues. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where she should expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It is surprising that the PCC did not start an investigation. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair stories? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by other newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as they could not afford to spend time hiding to take pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC watch all British newspapers: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably want to forget it and move on. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they know it might come out if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. A British comedian also suffered when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor recently, when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would show the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a joke, and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.'"

Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but many learned it over time. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
A. Jenny
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At 25, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous but did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was scared on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.
B. Michaela
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and acted too aggressive at first. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too much, I don't feel bad about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something hard, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to overcome it.
C. Lisa
People think I'm confident, but when I look calm, I'm actually scared. In TV, looking confident is important. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous, and we feel better when talking to friendly people. My mom once told me, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves."" I remember this advice. You gain confidence by facing fears. I was nervous for my driving test but passed. After that, I felt less scared.
D. Barbara
I enjoy my work, which gives me confidence. Over time, I've built it up. By learning from mistakes, you become more confident. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let that bother me. You should like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses that boost my confidence. Setting small goals helps you see progress, rather than aiming too high and achieving nothing.
E. Kim
After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak in meetings. Eventually, I started speaking up. In politics, I was nervous about public speaking. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing notes helped me feel better. Everyone gets nervous speaking in public. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""

'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He showed me a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a line of competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying skill. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to fix his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into mountains with thick rainforest. I took a wrong turn and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. Nearby, a sign pointed up a path into the forest: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' I didn't know that most of this path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay, trying not to think about insects under my mattress. The night was very dark and full of sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby and many creatures moved and made noises. In the morning, there was a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind, then lightning hit the treetops. I got soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car being washed away and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track.

I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband how much I've spent - I always say it's less! The real price always sounds too high. C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and I won't choose anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something I'd rather do. D. Anita, 35, TV producer I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and I get in and out quickly. I do have some mistakes at the back of my wardrobe, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes gets it wrong! E. Lizzie, 41, secretary I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy, everything is messy, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I rarely have to shop for clothes because most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish it quickly! F. Lisa, 22, actress I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out to look around the shops with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I'll buy it. G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't buy much. I usually know what I want and I rarely go crazy. I sometimes shop to cheer myself up, but I usually feel worse because I've spent too much! H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on a Saturday because it's too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper. I always have an idea of what I want, and I never buy things immediately. I look in other shops to find a better deal - I take a long time! I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager I'm an unwilling shopper - maybe because I work in the city centre, the shops have lost their attraction for me. When I have to, I'll go shopping, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of effort shopping!'"
