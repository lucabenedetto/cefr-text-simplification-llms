CPE_15,"Text: 'Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. However, it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Regularly, rubbish bags or bins are collected by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this service strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that fills four bins pays the same as an elderly couple that fills one. Yet, rubbish disposal is not free. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks, and higher landfill fees for local authorities. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The solution seems to be charging households for the waste they produce. This would encourage them to throw out less and recycle more, assuming there are recycling facilities. But, as economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found, this approach can have unexpected results. They studied American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per bag, the number of bags fell by 37%. However, people compacted more rubbish into each bag, reducing the weight of rubbish by only 14%. In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, rubbish weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying. The authors estimate this accounts for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling. In a broader study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing reduces rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices cuts rubbish by only 0.3%. This is lower than other studies, but not surprising. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to change much. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In richer towns, people throw out more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not as expected.'"
CPE_19,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Today, success in a career is not enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be enough, but now you must consider how your work affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because if your skills make you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, no amount of status or money will make up for your lack as a person.

I am exploring how work can focus on personal fulfillment, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also offer a fulfilling lifestyle, help discover hidden talents, and provide diverse human connections. However, this does not mean eliminating unemployment. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.

Even middle-class jobs are losing their appeal. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers are losing confidence. Companies and public institutions are downsizing, and strategies like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance have not gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's.

I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I have studied how different cultures expand human potential and create courage. I have looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I am focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts focus on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, unable to escape our jobs, working not to become better people, but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers, for example. They make up 10% of the workforce in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people work in hotels with low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels have not been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is not just a place to sleep but a mini United Nations where people from around the world meet, though often in silence. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have shallow interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests and the city, and bringing people together. Hoteliers could use the skills of the students they employ, rather than just giving them basic tasks. If they considered their staff's ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit this by focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and move beyond traditional categories.

For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people want independence and see work as an expression of their personality, they should have the chance to design their jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical and profitable limits. This requires knowing how to communicate beyond professional jargon, with people who may seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it is different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more personal interaction that creates respect and helps understand others, often changing us in the process. It is more than relaxation; it is a way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world a little bit."
CPE_24,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds widely by hand. This is not just an agricultural metaphor but also a symbol of modern growth and development. It suggests spreading resources from a central point to produce a rich outcome. The question is why a new technology that sent words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this metaphor. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. Yet, from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. This fit the social and economic structures of modern societies. 

There were attempts to organize television differently, but they remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Popular science magazines explained how to build TV transmitters and receivers, and many amateurs were active. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts out. Thus, the chance for a more egalitarian form of television was lost in Britain.

Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. In the USA in the early 1930s, television was mainly a medium for public viewing and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems were a real alternative. However, manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets, and centralised broadcasting to homes became the norm.

As working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s, the idea of the home as a center for entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernisation and broadcasting structures. As societies became more centralised, traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile and isolated. Centralised broadcasting helped governments reach citizens efficiently and create a sense of national community.

Broadcasting became the dominant form of radio and television. It also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information. However, television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific phase of social modernisation."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much you are influenced, try not to read any advertising signs next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages constantly influence us in very convincing ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, which makes us curious and eager to learn more about them. This has led to a lot of research. In some parts of the world, caves have even affected how people live. However, exploring caves often requires physical skill, so cave research is not just done by professors. There is a unique overlap between professional scientists and amateurs who explore caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the foundations of meteorology, which has become a highly technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now give us endless weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses long words that are hard for non-professionals to understand. It might seem like there's no room for simple weather knowledge, but that's not true. Human experience is still important for turning data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unique information that helps professionals understand the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera, and theatre comes second. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually speaks the same language as the performers.

At musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or musician is easy to admire because they show the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports event; we see athletes doing something similar to us but at a much higher level.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems close to what they could do. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. It means that in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the material is.

The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it connects with the audience's imagination. However, the formal traditions in music, like strict dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists, can make the experience feel hierarchical. On the other hand, when audiences applaud between movements or after a great performance, it can disrupt the flow of the music, even if it's meant as appreciation.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience that involved the audience directly, changing many people's lives.

I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes, using unusual locations can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences have learned to follow artists into unexpected places. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts, but I believe music conventions can and should change. I am just an enthusiast who loves both theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,"**Sand**

While I admire sand's amazing ability to become useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand flies around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

**Lock and Key**

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden bar behind the door has changed to an electronic lock opened by a plastic card with more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerised locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks with a digital command. But people don't like them. You might accept it at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have an opinion on more things. Then again, you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art, but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the reasons behind the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and actually explained what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels for film often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. When working on a script, I noticed how much dialogue and description from a novel could be removed while still conveying the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the type of attention each medium requires and the kind of repetition they use. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and understand who is speaking. In stage drama, speech often imitates real conversation, sometimes using language that seems redundant but helps establish a connection between characters.

**Watching Movies**

Watching movies can transport you into another world, making you forget about reality for a while. Once the film ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. In the past, movies were seen as mere entertainment, not art. Many people, including our parents and teachers, enjoyed movies but didn't consider them an art form.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but many rooms looked the same and were hard to find. The studio had three main entrances, all similar, and none had a place for visitors to ask for directions. Strangers rarely visited, as the studio didn't encourage it. Employees, however, knew their way around and worked together to create films that offered audiences a break from everyday life.

**Film-makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookshops sell guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and made him a well-known director. Rodriguez achieved his dream early, making his breakthrough film by age 23. In the past, filmmakers took time to mature, working behind the scenes before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without studio support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent."
CPE_3,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of small, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulphur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. 

Most of my early life is a blur. But I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, I recall faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of a mansion at Earlham. My mother often appears in these memories. She was a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry or how to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as on a moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. This moral code was beyond my understanding, and even now, I'm not sure I get it. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and many other rules.

Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. Later, I realized how poor their company was, as they often talked about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt part of. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up to lift it. This was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat in an armchair. Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. Some lucky children had a mother with a bike and a child seat. My mother, as far as I remember, let me go with other children in the street.

If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays, when you saw glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and a charity fete at a house far away, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in the League of Pity, a junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were 'only after your money'. She often talked about people having selfish motives, and she had a deep distrust of politicians. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where rich people took money from the public. I might exaggerate, but my mother had little kindness left in her. 

To be fair, my mother did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes', on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't against this activity and even started to have opinions on the art. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was a rare moment when my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly rain. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well; it was where our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, lived, along with Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the homes of my first playmates, all girls. Even though I didn't know everyone by name, each house was familiar to me, like the small channels in the cement that guided rain from the roofs to the street. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to change too: the porches were closer to the ground, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, there had been changes: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron, in a style that seemed Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.

**Bachelor Fads**

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. But Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space. He found it hard to separate work from home life in his last place. So, he used a large sheet of corrugated plastic to divide the space near the entrance. This created a hallway and led the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area, where he could either cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental furniture from his parents or bought from markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Was Bruce Chatwin trying to escape or explore? His romantic, wandering lifestyle is a mystery. Chatwin's life and work were full of secrets and sometimes lies. But he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was imaginative, like a thriller, with the charm of romantic fiction and deep insights. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction, changing reality for a better story or to capture the essence of his travels. He suggested that through travel, one could discover histories that seemed to exist just to fascinate future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a heavy summer rain in 1996, I ran across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I watched the raindrops hit the water, creating small fountains that turned into bubbles and burst. The best moments were when the storm got stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the pool as if it was reaching up to the sky. It was then that I thought of a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea, to escape the routine of swimming laps, always turning back like a tiger in a cage. Many places today are marked and explained, turning reality into something visual. Walking, cycling, and swimming let us rediscover what is old and wild, by leaving the usual paths and breaking free from the official version of things. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,"Text: 'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps form the bond between mother and child. Many think tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the visual signal it gives. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, and this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. Crying clearly has a social role, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but its consequences are not clear. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are important.

The problem is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human actions have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand the global heat balance, making the future uncertain. We know that greenhouse gas levels and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is partly due to human pollution.

Research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors. However, they are simplifications and have limitations. Despite these challenges, most agree that climate change will happen faster than before. GCMs suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns will change. Extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common.

Climate change can affect ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, and the benefits they provide. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and negative, but not all. Some impacts could be positive. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952 due to fewer frosts.

However, many predicted effects of climate warming are not beneficial. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin has seen less rainfall and changes in seasons. Glacial processes may also change, affecting ice and wildlife habitats. The Arctic ice cover might melt completely, which could help marine transport but increase iceberg risks.

The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and melting ice adds to the ocean. With half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island nations could disappear, causing devastating consequences for their people and cultures, and for countries that would need to help displaced people."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 are successful. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth are well-aligned for a launch is in 2031. It's a big challenge, and the race is on to create systems with new technologies. If these can be developed quickly, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**Aesthetics**

Sometimes, the existence of art can make it hard to understand aesthetic theory. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true work of art is what these objects do in our experiences. This misunderstanding can make it difficult to truly understand art.

Moreover, when art becomes famous and admired over time, it can create fixed ideas that block new insights. Once an art piece is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences and conditions that created it. This separation makes it hard to understand the broader meaning of art, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explain. Art is often seen as something separate from other human activities and achievements.

A key task for someone writing about the philosophy of art is to reconnect art with everyday life experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. To understand art, we need to look at ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider as art. This means taking a detour from the art itself to understand it better.

For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants, but to understand them, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art, we should start with everyday events and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy.

Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without considering them as art. This is because art is often seen as something only found in museums and galleries. However, when art is separated from everyday life, people find enjoyment in their daily surroundings. Even those who criticize the idea of art being only in museums often still separate art from ordinary experiences.

The best times for appreciating art are when it is closely connected to everyday life and work."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team. In the evening light, a group of lions quietly moves and surrounds their prey, working together like a team of skilled hunters. Lions seem to be very social animals, putting aside differences to achieve a common goal, like catching their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be beneficial. If an animal is too helpful, others might benefit more than it does. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could answer this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are often inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a new trend in rock music in the country for the decade. The old style of serious and plain rock was replaced by a lighter, more melodic sound. The album mixed social themes and strong emotions with sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were important, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting and observing different styles and were clever songwriters. They sang about traditional English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, sad songs like ""So Low,"" which was about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. ""New Life"" is great because all 16 tracks are high quality, with no unnecessary songs, which is rare in the era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women who had power in ancient times. I first heard about them in a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered nine books to Tarquin, King of Rome, for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three books and offered the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a lesson in the story about salesmanship and life. I was often a lonely child. When I asked to play with others, they sometimes said no. My mother advised me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something I was interested in. I'm not a big traveler, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to visit. I'm only interested in ruins because I like to travel through time in my mind.

**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it usually goes into a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" The person sorting it is often a young editorial assistant or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. They don't have much power, but they want to find something original. The young assistant hopes to make a name for themselves, and the freelancer wants to keep their job. If they like your novel, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it might be discussed at a meeting. The editor must justify accepting your novel based on its quality and sales potential. They also consider if you, as an author, have long-term potential, which you should mention in your letter. Another important factor is how promotable you are, as a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you worked in an advertising agency in the early 1990s, it might have been a very challenging time for you. The recession was severe, affecting many countries and industries. In Britain, 1991 was particularly tough: the economy shrank, interest rates were high, consumer spending dropped, many people lost their jobs, and many homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, especially the vehicle and building industries, which saw a 30% decline.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help improve company profits while working with smaller budgets. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies started focusing more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy to produce. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities.

Marketing was often seen as a solution to all problems, and with about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the pressure was on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the 1990s started with a downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because companies began questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money.

Client companies demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce excellent work. This meant that advertising professionals had to find ways to do more with less, just like their clients.

Several factors made creating effective advertising difficult. Some were due to the recession, like debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks. Other challenges were unrelated to the economy, such as demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising internationally.

These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider how to make their work more effective. However, finding help was not easy. Companies and agencies were too busy dealing with these challenges to share their strategies, and those who succeeded often kept their methods secret. Conferences and seminars offered some insights, but many books on advertising did not provide practical advice. They often portrayed advertising as always being high-quality and valuable, which was not always true or helpful for those responsible for advertising in client companies."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking was not a popular career choice. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs work long hours under pressure, doing basic tasks, and the pay is low. But these things didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life was closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. My desire to cook was not just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal for me. I first saw this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was an eye-opening experience. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I wanted to thank the chef deeply. I felt happy and light for days. After this, I wanted to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I changed my student life to prepare for a career in cooking. My history degree felt empty and distracted me from my real goal. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making fancy meals.

**Extract from a novel**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced that move until the hour was up. The next time, he had me stand upright and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes, I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices disappeared, and I felt as if I were in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not lessen my joy. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird,' I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both confusing and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone in small boats through huge waves, eating insects if necessary, and living for months in uncertainty. It's easy to see these people as odd, like hermits or writers. They exist, but their strange world is far from our daily experience and can be ignored as irrelevant. We can return to our world of microwaves and phones, thankful that our biggest risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**SAILING**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a top sailor, but he is clearly skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his experiences. Sailing provides him with stories of challenges and successes. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that tells sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he likes this tool, Raban has a primitive view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a 'break in the relationship between man and sea.' Since its use began about a thousand years ago, the compass has become the main focus for sailors, so they no longer study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the sailor's job is just to stay on course, an autopilot can replace him for long periods. This may be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate to experiences in books, even if they were written long ago or far away, because there are fewer human types than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't match. What is unclear in us is clearly written in books, especially if the book is from a different place or time. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during our first days in a new place, or when reading a great book. Books guide us to notice things we ignored before. Our mind becomes aware of new details, like the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.

**Author's Note**

These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small cuts made by the editor, but added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. I could have made more improvements, but that process would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people with no qualifications except the price of a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers are not blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been overused, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, as people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without regulations, many travelers are confused by the term.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it again by luck. It helped me write about that time, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in hospitable country houses for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only took notes instead of writing a full story. When writing this book, I worried some details were out of order, so I added warnings. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself without too many warnings."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing have been discovered, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.

**Writer**

Reports of publishers fighting over new manuscripts have given a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those not at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that are secure even if their book is not immediately successful. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of writing jobs at a chocolate factory, but I have never had such luck. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs and credit cards, and often with help from those mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we were playing at around the country started to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being mobbed. On our nights off, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I developed a strange confidence that only shy people in similar situations might understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Future Challenges**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam talks about their effect on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were more ways to listen to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia methods. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It seems clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. National events always include music, and for individuals, it offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.

I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, there is evidence that playing an instrument helps develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in school and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. Further research is exploring if playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice might help with good study habits and concentration, and playing in concerts might teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a demand for music lessons in the short term.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what direction will it take? I think two things are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making it easier for people to create music without needing technical skills. However, this might further reduce the need for live performances and musicians who only perform live. Alongside this trend, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of that community.

To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to change. Instrumental teaching must adapt to allow more people to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring them to stay relevant for a wider audience. They will need to include a broader range of musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They must motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, this is a chance for music educators to show the high quality of music teaching available.

Finally, we need to raise the profile of music. Music is important in our lives but is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and disrespect. This often happens when they talk about their work in interviews, as required by their film or theatre companies. Instead of using simple explanations like dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" actors often use clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when performed. Discussing it makes it seem theoretical and empty. Acting has no strict rules, except maybe being heard clearly. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning and growing with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, actors feel empty until the next project. This emptiness is noticeable when discussing theatre work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, showing simplicity and confidence. His understanding of the text and control over his body and mind make him a standout actor. Lester plays a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and likable. His performance is skillful, even if understated. Watch how his body seems ready to come alive. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives a similar impression of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a creation of real behavior? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly when others speak, noticing the effect of the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, wait for the impulse to speak, and then speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought come with their breath, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or inside. Actors should look into the eyes of the other actor and consider their character's situation. The director encourages not to plan or judge in advance but to trust that something will happen.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre should make you feel your presence matters. Going to a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's discouraging if the staff treats it like just another job. The theatre should create a connection between the performer and the audience. Everyone should have a clear view and feel connected to the stage. The size and shape of the auditorium are important. It should suit the human voice and body. If the auditorium is too big, it can overshadow the actors. Many theatres from the late 19th century got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. I like theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, showing layers of human presence. You can't please everyone with a play. Audiences don't always know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something unexpected, or else you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but it also had a big impact on middle-class and older people. It helped create the next group of rock stars, who were inspired by this new and exciting music. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this music was on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was very important for many future rock stars. Like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow beneath me collapsed. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, leaving only a thin layer that I broke through. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried about what I would have done if the hole had been deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only traveled about half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. While they often talk about collecting data, they don't always explain how to analyze it. Many researchers find data analysis mysterious. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about their methods. The goal was to share insights about data analysis, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden methods more clear. Although this seems easy, it is actually quite difficult. We let our contributors present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not much. Many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. Television, as my son and his noodles show, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs to be guided. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education still plays a big role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals didn't like it, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: it might make a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village - small-minded, with limited views - just a part of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, the main topic is films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: to work there, but live elsewhere. Yet, it is still the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.

**Photography**

Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting, accurate record of their surroundings, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a surface with light-sensitive chemicals created images more lasting and detailed than paintings. This worried other artists, and after their initial excitement, art critics claimed that photography was not art. They said photography was too tied to the real world and relied too much on machines to be considered a creative art. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new form of art. They used their tools like other artists use brushes and pencils - to interpret the world and show a vision of nature and people.

**Book Illustration**

During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This included many novels for older readers, which later had fewer illustrations as print runs became shorter. Children's publishing was active, but often low-budget, leading to some routine and average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of junk and treasure, a great place for research or browsing. The real treasures will likely return to public view, either through reissues of books or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may see the potential for reprinting classic children's book illustrations or creating new editions with the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern about the downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. 

Is this depressing? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the dangers of fame—long before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was invented at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and readers were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While his work was exhibitionist, it also had a beauty that some might call art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"Text: 'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. As countries become richer and busier, more people have trouble sleeping and feel anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books have characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, its benefits, and sleep problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A top sleep researcher says, 'People sleep less when they're busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' A sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight hours of sleep, showing they needed more sleep than they were getting. In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers, pay them, and ask them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures volunteers who worry about electrodes on their heads. The lab is more interested in physical effects. They have a driving simulator to test tired drivers. Volunteers come at 2pm, after little or no sleep, and drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has videos showing them dozing off. Coffee can help; two cups can make a tired driver safe for half an hour. Dr. Reyner suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum to stay alert. Shift workers might benefit from these. What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain. But these might also happen when awake and relaxed, so it's not certain. Scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why. When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, 'Sleep is a way to pass time safely.' Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then had a 'morning sleep.' This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which was more efficient. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours indoors, changing sleep patterns. Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then wake up. Continuous sleep is not possible because of noise, fire watching, and predators. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,"Text: 'We are talking about big boots here. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was no problem. I wore the full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. It wasn't working. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit, I was not at home in this place. I flew in from Denver just after dawn, and I thought I might look like a cowboy coming from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty bag when he saw my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and left without looking back. 

I wished there was an outfit for an ex-racing driver that made me feel like I belonged. Something I could wear so I wouldn't feel like I was from another planet. I loved being a racing driver. I am addicted to it, and it's all I know how to do. But I don't do it anymore. I couldn't even if I wanted to. The question is, I thought, looking at the rust-colored mountains, what do I do now? A racing driver should have other plans for when he stops racing. I thought I did, but they disappeared. How about being a commentator at the racetrack? 'We have fifteen former drivers ahead of you, Forrest. We'll call you.' 

Well then, how about selling classic cars? That lasted almost all winter with phone calls, lunches, and meetings. But it was the year nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealer list. So I left before there was nothing to leave. Being an 'ex' anything is hard. I mean, do you really want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. Even if I had been world champion, you would only listen for five minutes. Last year's champion is last year. Not that I want sympathy. I had a good run, made money, and kept enough. But oh, I miss driving that powerful, high-tech car. Zero to one hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. And yes, I miss the danger of racing. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being famous, even a little, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Little boys wanted my autograph. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Only last week the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and in the afternoon. And tomorrow is free, so much empty time. I looked up at the blue sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little brown birds in a cactus were giving me advice, like 'get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out'. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in designer boots had a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents like to walk through the city streets. If you join them, you will probably hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and jobs. Some people complain about the fast growth of new buildings, but it's clear that new residents and tourism have helped the city grow. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although the name is less popular now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists, like me, are often not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we focus on making a big impact in our work, so we lose the natural flow of a letter. Real creative artists, who don't think about the impact as much (even if they rewrite many times), don't have this problem. I think the true artist knows the effect of their words. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about the contrast in words that made them powerful, but it showed his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap star, a disc jockey, or a minor royal would often cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that celebrities are not needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud and the latecomers envious."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film, might do to them. Despite receiving mostly excellent reviews, the film was not a commercial success at first. It was television that later made it popular again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor, and he took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and that was the best place to do it. Carmel nodded her head both times, but it seemed like she wasn't really listening or understanding. ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. I thought it was almost a sinful thing, just wasting the day."" Dermot smiled back. ""You're allowed to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is becoming more important than money, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to describe the same roles."
CPE_55,"Text: 'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was usually why I traveled. Photographs were more than just my job; they were a big part of my life. I loved how light fell on surfaces and how one picture could capture the essence of a place or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph, as long as I had film in my camera. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking. That was my way. I once took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became famous. It was just luck, but it made me go freelance. However, the mid-nineties didn't turn out as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which was fine by me. The assignment came by chance. I had taken photos for a picture book called Four Cities in Four Seasons, which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had already done the London shots and was told that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job. They offered me the role because the Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available. Things at home weren't great, so I was happy to go. They put me up at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy and hot trip. This time, in cold January, it was different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great pictures. The first day, I just rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. The weather was cold and the city was like a frozen piece of history. I hadn't seen Schussner's work and didn't want to. This was going to be my Vienna. A photograph captures a moment, and I was waiting for the right moment. The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow had fallen overnight, making Stephansplatz white and empty. I wasn't sure how to capture the cathedral in one shot because it was so big. But in that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality. Even when you understand how it works, the mystery remains. Maybe that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me.'"
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**

Something amazing has happened: London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place of wonder. This change is not due to a big, expensive show, but because of a unique exhibition about kinetic art, which is art that involves movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an important, though often unnoticed, part of creative work in the 20th century. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for a long time, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films on kinetic art. These are displayed with little text, allowing visitors to make their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art is popular with many people, even those who usually aren't interested in art. This might be because his art is easy to understand or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be more interested in Hockney's personality and humor than his art. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but others argue that his popularity doesn't mean his work lacks value. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to judge his work by an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and knows that only time will tell his true place in art history.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

Recently, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some great and some not. What bothers me are shows that try to push a certain idea, suggesting all the artists share the same view. Sometimes this works, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. With seven artists, I used a space in an empty warehouse for an exhibition called 'Window-shopping.' The artworks were connected only by the fact that they were art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a typical themed exhibition, but they complemented each other through their differences. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but maybe there aren't any to make since art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who love paintings sometimes avoid analyzing them because they think it might ruin their experience. Some say that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the joy of looking at art and the creativity involved. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method takes away from enjoying the dish. Understanding something doesn't stop us from enjoying it; it might even enhance our pleasure. Enjoyment is complex, and how we experience it can be questioned. Our preferences are influenced by the society we live in, not just our genes or personalities. While it's important to appreciate the sensory experience of art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from its enjoyment is an old belief from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**

Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like a stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become important to primitive people. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people saw how useful copper tools were, they searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.

**St Ives**

We walked down the winding, cobbled lane to the town center, struggling against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were closed tight against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small railway. As the grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn't seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hard times are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't watch the past like a movie. However, computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth describe a situation with vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male in their group saw a strange male in nearby trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. This worked well until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while walking calmly across open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**

In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, people collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor used this data to estimate that cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is not accurate because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations high. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge of the platform, complaining about the day's work, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest there for a while. Eventually, they swim away, appearing tired and almost drowning, but they spend the day grazing among the reeds and bulrushes.

**PICASSO, Pablo**

In 1940, Picasso painted several fish still lifes while in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The fish and crab look alive, and the painting is hard to interpret because of its flat pattern and overlapping planes. The colors and brushwork create a calm, underwater feel. However, there is tension in the painting, with fish baring their teeth and the crab showing its claws. The sharp forms and a chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life and activity. In this short history, photography has grown in its ability to capture time and space, allowing us to see quick moments and visualize both large and small things. It has shown us images from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express the human experience.

However, using images to record events has a much longer history. The first pictorial records date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We do not know exactly why early cave paintings were made—whether they showed real hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply decorated living spaces. But images seem to be closely linked to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their role in society. The idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could create a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This chemical fixing of images captured what was considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image.

At the same time, photography was seen as a cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create with skill. Ironically, because cameras seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky.

However, with the rapid growth of global communication in the late 20th century, we need to ask if photographs can really cross cultural differences. Or is photography limited by cultural conventions like language? Is it possible that we take photography for granted and overlook its complex ways of showing reality?

Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and attitudes have changed greatly. This may be because photography has moved into ""mythic time""—its role as a 19th-century record-keeper has become historical. Photographs, once immediate and personal, are now historical documents, revealing much about the people and society that created them.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not just reflect culture; it can inspire social and political change. For example, the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance were influenced by new visual representation methods. Similarly, photography has contributed to the media culture of our time and has brought the world's harsh realities to our attention."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a field full of hidden dangers. You need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can ruin everything. Giving advice on writing poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination run free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others write to escape sadness. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid as long as they are not just copying others. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a question quickly and keep the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but it should not be so short that it feels like a summary. A short story needs to have conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must be important.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing what will happen next. They might see one or two moves ahead, and that's enough for them. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. They notice patterns, called gambits, and learn about openings, middle games, and end games. The more you play chess, the more you understand its complexities, just like writing a screenplay.

**Looking at Writing**

Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, but they don't naturally write. Language is found in all societies, and while languages change, they don't get better. English today is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. If children are together without a language, they create one. Writing, however, is different. Writing systems were invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and improved slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write. Even today, many struggle. Children are naturally good at speaking, but writing is a skill that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it to children."
CPE_8,"Text: 'I have never started a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make my story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I only want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still living, I have given them made-up names and taken care to ensure no one recognizes them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He might never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, so that, long after his death, people might realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source for my friend's biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, they truly represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words in the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book interesting. The smart reader will easily see where I have used this technique, and he is free to ignore it. Another reason I started this work with worry is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is very hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not only themselves; they are also the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them just by hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. Because you can't truly know people from another country except by observing them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters briefly in them. You give the reader broad hints and let him fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim that my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes.'"
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It is only later that people can see clear patterns and recognize important works. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be written, presented, and taught. There is a general debate between two groups: 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their poems to an audience. However, this division is not strict.

Public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small towns, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. The impact of these readings on poets is mixed. For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand when heard. However, on the page, their work might seem less impressive.

On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, aiming to express deep emotions and thoughts in a compact form, may not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience, which might not represent their best work.

Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm of the poems. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or is already familiar with the poems.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's wrong to think that someone's story is a perfect reflection of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is shaped by the historian's social position and how they understand history, which can affect the person being interviewed. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the person’s memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings like nostalgia or later life grievances. These emotions can make the story seem convincing, but they might not be from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science: focusing on the body (physiological) and looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles create behavior. The 'whole animal' approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually study learning in animals like rats and pigeons in labs. Ethologists study natural behavior in wild animals. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more basic. However, understanding nerve cells alone isn't enough; we also need to study behavior as a whole. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

New social science students face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge in textbooks and how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely linked. We might think social sciences are just common sense because we live in society, but they go beyond that. Each social science focuses on a specific part of social life, uses special methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts are the basic ideas that help social scientists go beyond common sense and define each discipline.

**Classical Architecture**

In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. Before it, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These basic forms contributed to later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, railway line, and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. Despite this, Chen was amused when he found out. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange because Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and planned a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, leaving early and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily practiced driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving, they reached the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with empty parking spaces, unsure of the road markings, so she preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""No one will want that heap of tin,"" which annoyed the sisters. Lily accused him of being ungrateful, and Mui said he was too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He decided to raise Man Kee his way, giving him a good education and experience in the restaurant business.

The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. It was a small, old tramp steamer. Chen told Man Kee that it was a special ship for them, one that would take them back home someday. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily tried to look through the telescope, but by then, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving her with a view of seagulls."
CPE_43,"**The Well**

I had read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle, but when I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. I didn't realize then that I had, in a way, succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like stars. Later, I understood they were like the stars and planets in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was okay. I was about to shout back, but your voice stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I saw the trail of water drops I had left. I was scared they would see them. Father shone a flashlight into the well. I couldn't believe no one noticed the drops. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I had wanted revenge on you, but now it was serious. I realized I needed a plan. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed, so no one could check. Father looked at me with disbelief. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me with pity, not because of my adventure, but because he saw through my lie. His look made me feel ashamed, as much as Father's words did. It was a lesson I couldn't ignore."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home now that her children are grown. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and Susan noticed that everything special about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house with a view of a small harbour. Memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air. 

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked how they would bring the house home. Now, Robert was helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also there, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano properly.

Fred, the removal man, commented that Susan didn't look like she was going to cry. He explained that many people cry when they see their home being taken apart, but they feel better once they reach the new place. Susan could understand this feeling. She remembered when they first moved in, and the piano got stuck on the stairs. Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano inside. 

Now, Susan was worried about the piano again. The banister rails were still not quite right from the last move. She felt she should have warned the movers, but it was too late. Fred reassured her that they just had the piano left to move. Susan was nervous, but Robert and Francesca were there to watch. 

As the piano was carefully moved down the stairs and out the door, Susan felt a mix of emotions. She almost cried, but when the piano was safely outside, Robert started laughing, and soon they were all laughing together. As they left the house for the last time, Susan's tears were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Book Reviews: Fun or Problematic?**

From the start, the Internet was meant to be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish or share content online. In reality, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly became accessible to everyone was book reviews. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon allowed anyone to say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it let readers see what others thought about a book, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions.

Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon, being the largest with over 80% of the online market, had the most reviews and also the most issues. Many reviews were submitted daily, and it was impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team to ensure reviews followed their rules. Reviews with only one word, personal attacks, or spoilers were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This allowed for some mischief. For example, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. Lev Grossman, an author, wrote fake positive reviews for his book after receiving bad ones. He admitted this in an article, and the fake reviews were removed.

Authors could also comment on their books through a special link. Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses to connect with readers. However, Amazon did not verify if the comments truly came from the authors, except for famous ones. A fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed because it was clearly not from him.

The real issues came from readers' reviews. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it was praised by the press but criticized by people mentioned in it. They used Amazon to express their anger, but their negative reviews disappeared after a few days. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as good for business. They monitored bestselling books closely to ensure reviews followed the rules. Silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology.

Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they often accurately reflected whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant inventing feelings about them. This makes the open review process on Amazon seem like a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people have started to think that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say that an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often express these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in modern art. We see artists as separate from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that cannot be contained by conventions. In the past, people would commission art for specific purposes, making it part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. An artist chooses a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the chosen text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any flashy or charming style. The question is: is the finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until 26th June, there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once a painter finds success in a certain style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and trying something new can upset them. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public often likes continuity. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully changed their style. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He is known for his still life paintings but is now focusing on the London Underground. His new show, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings inspired by the underground world, capturing its unique charm.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy, feeling suspended in memories. I spoke about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of creating art lies in the ability to reorder reality and show its meaningful side. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the true beauty beneath. For artists, art offers a way to make peace with what has hurt or defeated us in life, not to escape destiny, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"Text: 'Family Business'

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually very talkative. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""

""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I could see other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""

My mother wasn't around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""

""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.

So it happened. In my last term at school, and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.

This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need.

That was not all. As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever before his single-mindedness - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which made it a bad decision. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for their social and economic status as a young barrister and a businesswoman. 

To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him resentful. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where his grandmother made sure the family breadwinner was comfortable after a long day. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.

Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset when she confronted Simon. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a case four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He wished he had been prepared and said something different. Venetia's anger and disgust were intense, and Simon wondered why she was so upset. He questioned her right to judge him and worried about the impact on his career if the accusations spread, even as rumors."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I am watching the birds flying between the treetops and roofs. I have cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 

My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She is a writer with several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to pretend to like them because I am an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.' And some can neither write nor teach. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. 

I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements. The walk to the shops. The park with its fountain, and loneliness beside me on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, feeling nervous. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she will be around. 'Where will you stay? A nice B and B?' 'No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and rejection letters to hers. I decide to be honest. 'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks, offended. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good: less about yourself, more fiction...' 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 

Oh, I've got a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. But there is also a need to learn about our broader past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us find our place in history. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it is comforting to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. In the past, we connected with our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society has disrupted these traditions, so now places and buildings help us remember our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identity.

**The Fens**

I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I thought the Fens were a quiet, empty place to set my story. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, there is a place that feels foreign to many English people. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open yet mysterious. While writing my novel, I didn't explore the Fens extensively. I haven't visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than rely on facts. Imagining the Fens makes sense because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels. Today, accessibility means more. Displays can be lively and interesting, using techniques to capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually help them by increasing interest in the real items they have.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. This makes some people want to preserve everything, while others think more about the nature and future of towns. People who have lived through events like world wars may value preservation more than those before them. Stability becomes important. If there is a need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell products related to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experience. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying matter and natural forces. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and would criticize us, but our father would give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also give us better books as gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of these books as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that the origin of human language is a 'marvellous secret'. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. These sounds were desperate, and some words today might still echo these cries, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of such odd ideas, many people avoided the topic, thinking it was for eccentric thinkers. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, unlike what philosopher John Locke thought when he called language a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"Text: 'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode looks at the skill of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are written and shared in ways that make them last only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they stay relevant only as long as the newspaper they are in, which is usually a day or a week, at most a month. The short life of reviews often affects their literary value. Many people, including the writers, think that reviewing is a job done for reasons like needing money or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. It's one thing to be clear and fair in a short newspaper review, and another to write a detailed piece for international journals. The fifteen hundred words of a leading article in weekly magazines have challenges of both short and long reviews. Length is not the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about many topics and write in a way that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who doesn't think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews into books with modest titles. Some might think lesser-known writers should accept that their reviews are temporary, but if they can, they should enjoy some recognition, especially if they believe their best writing is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors like and are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. In the past, other academics criticized professors who reviewed for showing off or wasting time, but this is less common now. There is more reviewing today, so almost everyone can do some, even though the pay is often low. I believe this is good for readers, as they can trust the reviewer knows what they are talking about, and for professors, as it helps them stay connected to a wider audience. It reminds them to communicate clearly with non-professors. Finally, reviewing must be a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, quiet hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a brief doubt about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, curious about what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about intruders or problems like burst pipes, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he saw it as just another part of himself, filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or a blinking light on the answering machine when he returned. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the contents disturbed, though he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often forgot when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but once home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and his thoughts and feelings seemed lost, unable to connect. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had realized his own value. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he wasn't surprised to find he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find happiness in his work. He went to his only job interview with gratitude and didn't think to evaluate the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't consider the long meetings he would face daily. Neil offered him the job immediately, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, crowds of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch the goats run. Keeping the goats in order was not easy because they are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I worried about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of rushing water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.

**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 

You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of difficult questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and build towards your conclusion."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly to mayonnaise, it will curdle. If you pull on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But some things cannot be rushed, or they will fail, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line. Saying 'Think fast; we need the results' can be as silly as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds and are good for different tasks. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. Both are true. The mind has three different speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an instant reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my brain and body quickly reacted to keep me safe. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer does not have time to think about what to do next. This fast physical intelligence is called our 'wits'. Then there is thought itself: the kind of intelligence that involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this kind of thinking, which relies on reason and logic. We call this 'intellect'. Someone good at this is called 'bright' or 'clever'. Below this, there is a slower mental process. It is less clear and more relaxed. In this mode, we are thinking deeply or daydreaming. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. Thinking slowly is important. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that slower thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options may be obvious. But when we are unsure what to consider, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is how to manage a difficult group at work, or whether to change careers, it may be better to think slowly than to rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have always known the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to use these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of knowing. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can do many important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It's a friendly and well-supplied base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, anxious like I hadn't been since my first weeks at school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think the reason for my occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication, but because I've lost the social advantage my speaking skills usually give me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face though, and when I saw him again, he shook hands with me politely, but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot was more interested in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are excited by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made correctly, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Today, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the latest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can cause stress and make life feel disconnected. More choices mean more stress and complexity. People are now looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. We do not let anything disturb this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I dislike friendly waiters who almost want to pat you on the back. I know most of the guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for privacy is rare in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Othello**

An outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a previous unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young for the main role and criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona affects the tragedy, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are amazing. Don't miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except, there is a huge hidden area of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that some scientists are getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**

Our relationship with food is very basic and satisfying. Many people think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs into water. This is more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a tin. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with preservatives, you can make a delicious one in five minutes that everyone will love. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important in our lives, which is why we celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other events around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would discuss a business deal over tinned soup.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. He also had extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were near the new bookshelves but not organized. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She was always punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully, but she ignored him and went into his apartment, which she was responsible for. Mrs. Wilson thought of him as a visitor from somewhere far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**

Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story of strength. A key moment in her life was when she was twelve, and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles, she felt she was saved for a purpose.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty was walking across the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's exciting to be the first to know something important. However, she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years and had always been kind and patient. He made his patients feel like he had plenty of time for them and truly cared about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Joanna's performances are exciting, and she plays a wide range of music styles, including classical, jazz, and blues. At a recent concert for children, a young boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day,"" a popular TV theme. Joanna found this amusing and played it, impressing the boy.

Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has published her own piano tutor for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even though she has a very busy work schedule. She is involved in many music festivals, runs her own recording label, and often collaborates with other artists.

Joanna believes that the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks that music should be accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent. She grew up in a home where her mother taught piano to children of all backgrounds, which influenced her views on music education.

Joanna is interested in helping children who learn at different speeds. She is concerned that some parents push their children too hard to achieve in music, which can lead to children giving up. She believes music should be enjoyable and not just about meeting expectations.

Her piano books are designed to make learning fun. They include storylines and CDs with accompaniments for children to play along with. Joanna emphasizes the importance of practice and encourages children to enjoy playing, even if they make mistakes. She believes that practice is the most important part of learning music and shares tips on how to make it more effective and enjoyable."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is often difficult to create. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was hard work. Writing slowly made me think carefully. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with care. On the other hand, using a computer can make us careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with many being sent today. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers who are not used to the power of words may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and character of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he returned to the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. Lights came on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. You could make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my chair. ""Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd think they were an improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. Some people thought books would disappear in the 1980s, but they were wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so most people don't do it. Computers encourage people to read small parts of text. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but non-linear reading is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. What is new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of papers, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction. Neat file-holders were in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about computers or any other machines, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. She could use a keyboard to change any software into something new."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, more as a statement than a question. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away would lead to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see another synopsis. He wanted a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but commissioning books from friends was a mistake. Ian was unpredictable and unreliable. Lancelot skipped the introduction and read the synopsis. It was all familiar. He closed the folder, knowing Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt uninspired. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But Ian's advance was huge, against the usual practice of paying authors after they deliver a manuscript. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers took over British theatre, but Ian's potential remained untapped. He was difficult to work with, even when appointed to edit an arts magazine. The magazine used its budget without publishing. His contract with a fashion magazine produced little but stories about his high salary. At editorial meetings, Ian criticized others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'England's breakfast change The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts. However, historically, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and to the sick having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobles. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common. Some say this was because food was more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working for set hours, often very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was not just for the wealthy. '"
CPE_61,"**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might understand the photos on the page, but we can ask if the photo truly shows the scene as it was. Does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or is the photo a symbol of a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**

For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-belief. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sport. There is only one way to be the best, and you must put everything else aside. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but also the value of teamwork. My sport allows individual excellence, but it is a team game, and you must balance these aspects. It's like life - you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened doors and my eyes, showing me things around the world that others may never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so clear in our memory that they stand out. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree in the neighborhood. I don't have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, improvised performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through the open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a small brown bird, a wren, is hitting the glass. Wrens are seen as mysterious birds, linked to messages and predictions. Is this wren trying to tell me something, or is it just trapped? Both ideas could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could bring good or bad luck. Today, wrens are still popular in British art and homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens still hold a place in our hearts. A forest without wrens feels empty. 

This connection to birds comes from old traditions when people understood nature differently. In the past, people depended on nature for survival and developed a way to communicate the importance of animals. This importance can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a valued bird in London, but later seen as a pest and almost disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and seen as symbols of conservation in Britain.

Our connection to birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds to learn about dangers, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and wish to imitate. Some people think these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of us. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have deep cultural meanings. Their loss is felt by those who know their significance in literature and folklore.

Folklore is important. Stories and legends about birds have a strong connection to them, more than scientific terms. These stories evoke feelings and memories buried by modern life. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we don't fully understand, and the stories we tell help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding its song as it flies into the future, leaving us with a mystery to ponder."
CPE_28,"Text: 'Maps The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are determined by distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in terms of time, like 'a day's journey by river', which told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?' Because of this, written travel guides were often as useful as maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of these signs depended on the map's purpose and where it was made, so understanding early maps requires knowing the conventions used. The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more information to maps. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, maps became more detailed. Astronomers found that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more accurate maps of large areas. Over time, the needs of map users changed. Maps were no longer just for travelers or merchants. Soldiers needed accurate maps for artillery, which led to the invention of contour lines to show surface features. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also had specific needs for maps. Modern cartographers have developed ways to map different types of information, like geological layers and land use. Today, maps are valued for their ability to help understand and organize information in many sciences, leading to a modern revival of cartography. However, the development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change, with old ideas sometimes persisting alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what was needed for progress but had to wait for better tools. Since it was easier to copy old maps, and because of the costs involved, map publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record of human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and educational.'"
CPE_35,"**Text Simplified for B2 Level:**

I was invited into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and surprisingly, he had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as crazy; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me, though I can say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me, to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I was willing to try. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed—I could tell he was very good. As he confidently played selections from shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I had little to impress him with, other than praising his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with him. Even if we failed to become top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and might need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, my brief certainty of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber faded a bit. I would continue to look at ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and write more simple songs that suited my voice, but it was likely I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have grown out of pop music, as my father predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and write lyrics like musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was clear, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. His story was worthy, but it didn't really excite me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the project was unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was infectious and not completely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title, most of which had probably been thought up by his previous lyricist friend. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,"**Language**

Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other using language. Language is so important in our lives that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to speak naturally, just like spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a smart spider or need special training.

**Climate and Weather**

Climate and weather, created by the air around us, greatly influence where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet climates all year support tropical jungles, which have a huge variety of species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large masses of air moving and mixing. The atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the air is on a spinning Earth, and it doesn't move as fast as the planet. The sun is an even more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**

As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and make coffee, which was more challenging. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning a lot about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be moved to simpler tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be perfect for TV because the camera can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series manage to show both the enjoyment and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. Metals markets are less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a big part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, free-trade economists who thought the market would keep metal prices stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are decreasing. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not just the sea that has treasures. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle."
CPE_69,"Text: 'Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK The Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a course where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame over a weekend. It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is buzzing with activity. This is the UK's only bamboo bike-building course. Bamboo is becoming popular in bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire using it. However, their bikes are expensive, with frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable for the average cyclist. They spent years developing their idea in a shed in Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell frames; they wanted to share the experience of making something unique and sustainable. The Bamboo Bike Club is more like a community than a company. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so the club is a side project for them. They offer monthly courses where you can build a custom bike frame for a competitive price. On the first day, participants learn how to choose bamboo for strength and make strong joints. The bamboo tubes are glued together to form the bike's frame. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian help participants with the technical skills needed, like using tools and following design plans. The self-build aspect is a big draw for many, especially engineers. Ian reassures that mistakes are okay, and you can try again with a new piece of bamboo. On Sunday, participants wrap hemp bindings around the joints and glue them with epoxy resin for strength. A final coating makes the bike waterproof. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian has used his bamboo bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months. The bikes are over-engineered for extra strength. Bamboo bikes have a unique look, which some might find scruffy compared to professional frames, but they are individual. The ride is smooth and light, as bamboo absorbs vibrations well. The cost of building your own bamboo bike is less than £500.'"
CPE_38,"**Self-help Books**

Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she found a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller just by looking at the title,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on communication between men and women is a symbol of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans improve their lives, but it also creates more desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is also popular, with many books being published, though many are rejected for being too similar or too specific. Editors focus on marketability, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Dione Reverend says that a catchy title is crucial for success.

**Autobiographies**

There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this is often not fully observed. Writers may leave out shameful actions or thoughts, or things they consider unimportant. Some writers may invent stories to better express the truth about themselves. Others may call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without cynicism.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Detective stories have been explained as a reflection of the conflicts in late 19th and early 20th-century society. They are allegories where crime represents human impulses like lust or greed, and solving the crime restores order. In Hammett's stories, society is shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are comfortable with each other. The detective is both a crook and a competitor. His mission is sometimes affected by his sense of complicity, and his zeal is sometimes intensified by his anxiety about this ambiguity.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. I met him at the Grand Hotel to discuss writing. Gould believes that understanding the culture is essential for successful writing. He says that science is its own civilization, and only scientists can present it well. One of Gould's rules is to never write down to the reader. ""You can simplify the language but must never simplify the argument,"" he says. If readers feel patronized, the writing fails."
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, the air feels very cold. To handle this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. This is an example of how people often misuse air-conditioning. It is now a key part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation and have thicker walls that keep out heat during the day and release it at night. These simple ideas can greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are again interested in sundials. Sundials measure time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were important for keeping clocks accurate. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks their charm is in their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I first saw china-painting at an arts and crafts show, where serious-looking older women painted teacups with delicate flowers. It was fascinating because each brushstroke was perfect. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed like they had practiced for years or had a natural talent. Remembering this, I wondered who would join a china-painting class. Would beginners also have natural skill? In reality, the class was not intimidating. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I remembered."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk mentioned that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear elderly people on the plane speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they arrived at the hotel, and they were too tired to question it. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist explained they had the lake and water birds, and they could take a steamer to Interlaken.

Keith calmly told the receptionist there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, approached them. Dawne explained they were in the wrong hotel. Mrs. Franks explained that Your-Kind-of-Holiday had many trips, and all tickets looked similar. She laughed and said they couldn't end up in a wildlife park by mistake.

Keith insisted they weren't meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith wasn't listening. He tried to remember everything that happened: giving the tickets, waiting, boarding the plane, and the pilot's welcome.

An elderly man named Nottage interrupted Keith's thoughts, saying he and his wife had the best sleep in years due to the lakeside air. Dawne politely responded. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. Outside, they didn't mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up with a group of elderly people, when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had even said so when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. In America, however, he has only recently gained attention. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing great interest. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his achievements with admiration and learn lessons in leadership and communication from them. They even refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton.' The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises.' For example, dealing with situations like 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go.' Shackleton's experience in public relations for a Glasgow steel works might not seem directly relevant to handling a derivatives trading disaster, but MacGregor explains, 'Even if a company manages its crises well, it can still cause harm by communicating poorly.' Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. He had his values in order and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most fascinating decisions was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his credibility for future expeditions: the lives of his men were most important. This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole when, 97 miles short of their goal, with delays draining their supplies and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. While managers today might avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety if you continue to do your best and trust me.' From the accounts and diaries kept by his men, it is clear that Shackleton was always in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every possibility, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start anew. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is nothing, especially in America, a culture that is against letting time solve problems,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product is a failure, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave his own to Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on, he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavor is increasing. Shackleton shows that there is nothing heroic happening now. Everything else fades away, and he stands as the true embodiment of the ideals we long for today.'"
CAE_15,"Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar's Forests In the forests of Madagascar, there is a primate called the aye-aye that lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye search for insect larvae by making holes in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue, while the aye-aye uses its teeth to gnaw and its long third finger to scoop out the insects. Although scientists described the aye-aye's feeding habits over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He tested if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood's surface, like holes where insects might have laid eggs. Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with drilled holes. Some holes led to mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the holes with food, without needing visual clues. Dr. Erickson also tested if they used smell or sound to find the insects. The aye-ayes could still find mealworms even when the smell was blocked, and they found dead, silent mealworms too. So, how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson discovered that aye-ayes could sense empty spaces in the wood. They tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their large ears. Dr. Erickson thinks they use echo-location, listening for sounds that indicate a hollow space. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping. The idea that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role might not be empty. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat combined. It also acts like a squirrel, as its teeth grow continuously, and it has been seen gnawing through nut shells to eat the nut inside.'"
CAE_19,"Text: 'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries give us small glimpses, and family stories are often forgotten. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still just images. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if wanted. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of privacy helps people be honest. ""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something, but I haven't let my children read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know now. If they insist, I'll let them. But I'd rather they read it after I'm gone."" He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things learned in childhood affect them for life. They marry people their parents would like or do the opposite to rebel."" ""Many disappointments come out. Even sixty years later, people regret or resent things not resolved with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had issues in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some want to say 'I can't stand my mother.'"" Ms. Renier listens rather than asks too many questions. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should go in.' I include it anyway—they can remove it when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest."" ""It's not vanity publishing. It's not people saying 'I've had such an interesting life the world needs to know.' Things are changing faster than ever, and we are losing touch with the past. It's a way to connect with our ancestors because families don't stay together as much anymore. People want a little immortality."" Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing and interpreting it. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with gold lettering: you can choose your own color and title. Fascinating to the private audience for whom each book is made, the results are not about revealing secrets at any cost. Ms. Renier organizes her material logically and writes well, and the final content is as good as its subject. The book looks high-quality and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost, due to the time involved, deters many people. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with have all been well-off, readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They're the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few remaining collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of the sculptures here are original. They are all accurate copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. Plaster casts have many benefits: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see nearly all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**

The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and from all over the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, belonging to Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens kept in their original early 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to trace major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with detailed labels explaining their nature and modern uses.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**

The collection has over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and does photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These are made to order and typically take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world and is a unique tourist attraction in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center has preserved the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. Brass plates, used as an alternative to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**

I have had 35 years of being around small children, and I have loved every minute. This morning, I fed the baby, and for me, that is what being a father is all about. I am very lucky with my children. We all love opera, theatre, books, and music, which creates a strong bond. Now that they are mostly grown up, I am more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here if they need me, but I let them contact me. If you chase them to ask why they haven't been in touch, it creates guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**

I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and clothes. This has been very helpful for running the agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy with my business, so I missed some events like first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising awards with us without feeling shy. I think it helps that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.

**C. The Politician**

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if there are facilities for the kids to come with me. This way, they know what I do when I am not with them, and there is no feeling of me disappearing. I have noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more aware of the need to involve our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**

My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think about fatherhood more deeply. I made great efforts to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wanted, but I think they found that confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently complained that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more order. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**

I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a kid instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just one more parent in a long line of parents. It's a great equalizer. I sometimes feel annoyed, but one look at her dispels it. A baby's smile is the greatest way to melt a grown man."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing their theories in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a regular aircraft. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, appearances were misleading, and the 13 students from Europe and America were about to experience an extraordinary flight. Inside, the plane was a long white tunnel with almost no windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat. For a year, they had competed with other students to join this flight. The European Space Agency challenged them to propose creative experiments to conduct in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a place on this unique flight, which was like an incredible roller-coaster ride.

For the next two hours, the Boeing's flight would mimic a giant bird's erratic movements, soaring upwards and then diving towards Earth. The goal was to achieve weightlessness at the top of each curve. At 3,000 meters, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane continued to rise due to its momentum before gravity pulled it back down. In the few silent seconds between rising and falling, the aircraft and everything inside became weightless, and the 13 students would feel closer to the moon than the Earth.

The aircraft took off smoothly, but any illusions of a normal flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor. Then the engines cut out, and weightlessness was almost immediate. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a trampoline, and a single step launched us towards the ceiling. We floated aimlessly; directions like left, right, up, or down lost their meaning. Only gravity, by anchoring us, allows us to understand movement.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was less sudden than its loss, but still abrupt enough to make some students land with a bump. After the first curve, some students turned green at the thought of 29 more. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to understand how cats always land on their feet. They released their device, and one student managed to turn it belly-down using radio controls. However, another student accidentally landed on it during a rough return to gravity.

Next to the robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joins are affected by the absence of gravity, with future space stations in mind. Another team from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They spent the flight trying to produce these films in microgravity. They believe that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation like a yacht uses the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not nausea. This was an experience that would stay with us for a long time. ""It was unforgettable,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

Jonathon Porritt talks to Danny Danziger

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a unique time in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had the idea of buying a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you can plant it with trees, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which was nice since my father grew up there. They found a plot about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.

I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees was appealing to me. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres. In 1968, it was a very rainy winter in New Zealand. It rained almost every day we were planting, and I don't think I've ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for another day of planting. Coming out of the Land Rover warm and dry, with rain falling, and your jacket still damp from the day before, boots wet, and hands struggling with slippery laces.

In the first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You carry a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's difficult, but it gets easier as it becomes lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide the spacing for the trees, line up three poles across a long distance, and those poles guide your lines. Once aligned, you plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig the hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs, where you train your body to perform standard moves, making the process easy: taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, planting it, stamping it in, and moving on. Mentally, it's interesting. Your mind starts to wander, and you think about life. Many of my thoughts about the natural world and our place in it began during those days.

I've returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying because I planted them. I worry when I read about storms or droughts in New Zealand. However, the trees are now 20 years old and doing well. I took a break from teaching in 1984 and went back alone for three months. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There's a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. The connection between me and that area is still very strong. It's the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" I thought when a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. Inside, I found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early life underground. If orphaned, they usually die of starvation. These three were found by builders who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. The cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing their fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them by the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to mimic their mother licking them, which helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. They seemed content with each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ""mum.""

Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was lethargic, though he was eating normally. It was a warning sign I missed, and the next morning, I found him dead. The vet's post-mortem showed Willow died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. Disheartened, I continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He was cold and hungry, so we named him Willow II and took him in. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females. Feeding him was difficult; I had to move the bottle's teat around and squeeze it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything. Willow II was different; he struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods.

At nearly five months old, they were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, my badgers became nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in, but I learned to avoid their playful nips. Derek, who joined us less often, didn't learn this and sometimes reacted colorfully to being caught. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, as badgers are territorial and can kill intruders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we secured it with sheet metal.

The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response led us to start an appeal to build a sett on the farm. With advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew up the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate facing their usual walk direction. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for viewing. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they preferred the sett to walks. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company, Badgerline, sponsored part of it, and local firms donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Later, I checked on them and saw three badgers curled up asleep in their chambers.

These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still greet us before heading off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,"Text: 'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was mapping the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors could not accurately use their compasses to find longitude and navigate the seas. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip ended early due to crew problems, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. This chart was very useful to sailors for over a century until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate. Dr Clark, who enjoys sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is supporting him. Dr Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist. 'Halley led a remarkable life,' says Dr Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his work on Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Dr Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with more precise instruments. These measurements are needed because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the international geomagnetic reference field, a model of Earth's magnetic field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. That's because you need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr Clark. 'On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to determine that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in its coverage of the Atlantic Ocean. It is important to remember how significant Halley's Atlantic journey was. It was the first scientific expedition at sea, and Halley was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to study declination. Does Dr Clark have the skills to make his voyage a success? He spent two years in Antarctica and works in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,"**Power Dressing Every Summer**

Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where survival is tough, why do peacocks have such extravagant tails? How do they manage to survive with them?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying these peacocks to find answers. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the fittest survive. However, he thought the peacock's tail was a problem because it seemed useless and even a burden. To explain this, he suggested a different idea called 'sexual selection,' where females choose mates based on beauty.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens chose the most beautiful males, there must be a good reason. The peacock's tail might signal some hidden quality that helps survival.

Today, the debate continues. At Whipsnade, 200 peacocks live in conditions similar to the wild, providing a chance to study them. Petrie and her team are asking two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have other advantages, as Wallace thought, or is it just about looks, as Darwin suggested?

Observations show that peahens do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. These males attract more mates. However, it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free of parasites, which their plumage shows. While this is true for some birds, Petrie's team hasn't tested this in Whipsnade peacocks yet. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and less attractive males to see if the former's offspring grow faster or are healthier. If true, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

Lastly, R.A. Fisher, a mathematician and biologist, proposed 'Fisher's Runaway.' He suggested that if females prefer slightly better tails, their sons will inherit these tails, and daughters will inherit the preference. Over generations, this could lead to longer tails, supporting Darwin's idea of 'beauty for beauty's sake.'"
CAE_66,"Text: 'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should mix old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with new technology. Most of these yachts are based on a design change from 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. You might think I am a romantic dreamer, but I am not. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but modern technology made it easier to build. However, modern technology often protects sailors from the tough parts of sea life, which they might want to experience. I am not saying sailors should suffer, but I like my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable beds. Why go sailing if everything is automatic? Sometimes, dealing with the sails is part of the adventure. Also, why move the steering from the back to the middle of the boat? This change makes more space inside, like a big ship, but I think a boat should feel like a boat, not a house. When I bought my old boat, Hirta, for a TV race around Britain, the previous owner said it had comfort but no luxury. I learned he was right. Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, no electricity, no fridge, no heating, no winches, and no electronics, but it was the nicest boat I ever sailed. However, old boats need a lot of care. After I hurt my back, I knew I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a good new boat, so I decided to build one. The Westerman has been great. Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his assistant, used computers to design it, but Irens first drew it on a napkin. Then he made a model, like in the old days. We looked at the model and made changes on the computer. The final design was perfect. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. It looks timeless, sails well, and feels peaceful inside. This is because it was designed as a sailing boat first, not for the furniture inside. This old method works well. The boat is made of wood with a special glue, so it is waterproof like a fiberglass boat but looks and feels like a traditional one.'"
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was excited to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm immediately. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes like stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The one-hour facial made me feel like a new person. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning a major renovation this year, including a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to visit again. This is the perfect break for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear from the moment I climbed the large staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a charming conservatory, and lots of space, so you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. On arrival, everyone gets a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I'm healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem found during the check-up was immediately addressed by the fitness instructor. We worked on it in group workshops and an extra individual session. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I was hungry enough to get a headache on the second day. My typical daily menu was grapefruit and honey for breakfast, a choice of salads for lunch, and exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for supper. If you're not fasting or on a light diet, you eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You have a massage or water therapy on alternate days. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't claim to be. It's a lovely old manor farm with inviting log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're counting calories, you'll have to skip the gourmet food. The French chef creates rich sauces and delightful creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool to work off some of the indulgences. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist recommended good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.

**D. CLIVEDEN**

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant, offers dishes that are hard to resist. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu; the choices were amazing. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed a happy woman! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden offers fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone and firm the body if you want to use them—before enjoying yourself at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**

The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It's the best because it's the most delicious I've ever tasted. It's the worst because it's a large piece with 360 calories, which isn't good if you want to lose weight. You've been warned! The second best thing is the fabulous aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils, fell asleep twice during the massage, and had my most refreshing night's sleep in years. The premises are modern and purpose-built, efficiently run, with up-to-date facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are plenty of therapists and beauty rooms, so it's easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people—from entire football teams to mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much genetically. We are still more than 98% identical to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are recent. Our ability to make art and other human traits must come from a small part of our genes. This is why studies show that many things we thought were unique to humans are also found in animals, just to different degrees. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple languages with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. 

These findings suggest that there are few absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art. But if art is a unique human trait, why did our ancestors not create it for most of our history? The earliest art might have been wood carvings or body painting, which don't last over time. Clear evidence of human art, like cave paintings and sculptures, only appears around 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons.

If we say that our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from animal creations? Three main differences are often suggested: human art is non-utilitarian, made for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive.

1. **Non-utilitarian**: Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means human art doesn't help us survive or reproduce, unlike most animal behaviors. For example, birdsong helps defend territory or attract mates, which helps pass on genes. By this measure, human art is different.

2. **Aesthetic pleasure**: Human art is often made for beauty or enjoyment. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during breeding season, suggesting it's not just for pleasure. Again, human art seems unique.

3. **Learned activity**: Human art styles are learned, not instinctive. Different cultures have distinct art styles, like songs in Tokyo and Paris. People can learn each other's art, unlike some birds that inherit their songs. A French baby raised in Japan wouldn't spontaneously sing the French national anthem. Human art changes quickly, unlike animal behaviors that stay the same over time.

Even so, some animal art blurs these lines. In the 1950s, chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy created paintings that looked like abstract art. Congo made many paintings in one day and seemed to enjoy it. Their art was shown in a London gallery, and many paintings were sold. This shows that some animal art, like human art, is not just for survival or communication. While human art often aims to communicate, some famous human art was made for personal satisfaction, similar to the chimpanzees' art."
CAE_39,"Text: 'A Big Adventure The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell the story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance on their journeys into the unknown. These days, you don't find such people in stories or real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore. Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but locals call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey, while sitting calmly at home. The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and put the expedition at risk. This group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's least friendly desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote an amazing account of their journey. At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I always thought I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back because nobody had ever done that route; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.' Anyone reading his story of that crossing will wonder why he used the word 'kind'. The team faced terrible hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst and dehydration, and the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never faced the raw, biting desert cold that would have stopped us completely. That's not to say we weren't fighting against challenges the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us. 'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Neither our budget nor time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. 'I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment, I was a very scared man.' If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you're not going to give up. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and strong despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned, and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.' Midway through the book, Blackmore described lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How aware was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievement, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that measure, the desert does not compare.' Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were lifted by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the sameness of modern life.''"
CAE_18,"Text: Susan Harr decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us gadgets that make life easier and save time. However, Susan feels that technology has made us believe it is essential, even though it can be expensive and troublesome. After a bad experience with her word processor, she started to let go of household technology as it broke down. She questions if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets. 

When her sewing machine started making strange noises, she left it in the backyard and began sewing by hand. She enjoys not being tied to a noisy machine and can take her sewing with her anywhere. While she appreciates some gadgets, like the washing machine, she found joy in losing others. Without a color TV, her family spends more time walking the dog, reading, and talking. 

Sewing by hand has become a new hobby for Susan. Her old sewing machine is now a plant table, and she can't afford a new one. She finds sewing by hand relaxing and satisfying, as it allows her to listen to the radio or talk with family. It also helps her feel less guilty about watching TV. 

Susan used to think sewing by hand was tedious, but now she finds it soothing and rewarding. It slows down her life to a comfortable pace. She also enjoys washing dishes by hand, which gives her time to daydream. Now, she wonders if her family really needs gadgets like the freezer, microwave, or lawnmower. She even considers saving money by not using electric lights."
CAE_62,"Text: 'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man in a hurry. When I arrive at his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, 'Well, fire away then!' It's not clear if his abruptness is real or if he's just shy. But looking around the workshop, it's obvious Hurst is busy, with many half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in various natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. His order book is always full for months, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the person to go to. Finding a furniture-maker isn't hard, but finding one who makes beautifully crafted furniture with simple lines is rare. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says. He is disappointed by some modern furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will accept.' He dislikes poor-quality, mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who make second-rate pieces. His quest for perfection and his talent are keys to his success. Hurst is confident in his ability. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says. 'I have always been good at making things.' He is self-taught. How did he learn? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says. Most of his work comes from private clients. 'I used to do some commercial work for companies, but it was soul-destroying.' Some clients return many times. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he admits that relationships with clients aren't always smooth. 'The most infuriating clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favorite clients are the exacting ones.' Hurst is also gracious in praising others when deserved. 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (a top furniture design college). However, he criticizes craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also dislikes degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. 'That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.' Hurst is confident and sometimes brusque, but his work is not pretentious. As I leave, he shows a humble side, saying, 'After all, I am only making furniture.''"

It suggests that we sleep to repair any damage done during the day and to restore our bodies to full strength. Another theory focuses on the learning benefits of sleep. It suggests that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day, and without sleep, learning would not happen. A third theory is about energy.

CAE_31,"Text: 'ECCENTRICS An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and who does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and odd habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity is about expressing our individuality. Inside us, there is often a conflict between wanting to be unique and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains on the same track, one called individualism and the other conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel connected with others more than we want to stand out. People with unusual hobbies or behaviors often gather together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, is comforting. We all feel a tension between being individual and conforming. While we often follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We want to show our individuality, like when someone at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new acquaintance says, ""You must take me as you find me."" At any time, we can choose to be more individual. Many successful people have done this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk."" But this self-conscious individuality is not eccentricity, at least not at first. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a society hostess makes shocking comments to get noticed, that is not eccentricity. However, if they continue these actions until they become a natural part of them, then they might be considered eccentric. The key to eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. True eccentrics are not concerned with public opinion; they are barely aware of it. They do what they do because of who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all very aware of the world around them. Eccentrics, however, continue on their path regardless of society.'"
CAE_58,"Text: 'Natural Books We asked four leading naturalists to tell us about the wildlife book that has influenced them the most. A Geoffrey Lean Choosing the author was easy. As an environmental journalist, I've had the chance to meet some of the pioneers in the field. None of them stood out more than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field. Picking the book was harder. It could have been Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But The Home of Man, despite its old-fashioned title, is her most important book to me. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the themes she dedicated her life to. It's a passionate plea for what we now call 'sustainable human development'. I've read hundreds of books since, but none match it. B Linda Bennett When I read Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the colony. This book explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony changes from chaos to an efficient social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families. Niko Tinbergen was a behaviourist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with wildlife artist Eric Ennion was inspiring and created a book for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's painting style came from years of observing birds. With minimal lines and color, he shows how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the art of a true field naturalist. C Lee Durrell My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced my life the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book defined my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. I was discouraged by setbacks, but reading the book made the world brighter. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty together—a world worth saving. Some say humans are the worst species because of the harm we've done. But I think of Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing the world as a family, all connected. This is a concept we all need to understand. D Bruce Pearson I found The Shell Bird Book by James Fisher in my school library after it was published in 1966. I was drawn to the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and spent holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to sketch birds to help with identification. But The Shell Bird Book offered more. It had chapters on migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and images led me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid as a scientific one. Since art was a stronger subject for me than math or physics, I saw a new path opening for me.'"
CAE_37,"**Do Reviews Sell Books?**

We asked five top British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said:

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. The Book Marketing Council found that more people buy books because of reviews than for any other reason, like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are less upset by bad reviews. They believe that any mention, whether good or bad, can help sales as readers want to decide for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinion of the book.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and the press both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make a book and author known. A good review by a trusted person can boost sales, especially if there are several reviews. Fame helps sell books.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. We publish books by less-known authors and rely on reviews because we don't advertise much. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest opinions. Reviews can help launch a book and a career, but they need to be combined with other things like word-of-mouth and good marketing.

**Publisher D**  
In the US, a review in the New York Times can greatly affect a book's success. In Britain, it's less predictable. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for a writer to become popular. Some poorly reviewed books sell well, while others don't. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
Publishers and writers want long, positive reviews, but do they sell books? I published a biography that got great reviews, but it didn't sell because people felt they didn't need to read the book after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the unexpected choice of reviewer or the quality of the review that attracts buyers."
CAE_2,"Text: 'WEATHERVANE MAKER The making of weathervanes is an ancient skill, dating back to early Egyptian times. Today, this craft is still alive in Graham Smith's workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham's designs are unique and made to fit his customers' specific needs. 'This way, I can create a personalized item,' he explains. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's work or hobbies.' This is very different from the traditional cockerel, the most common weathervane design. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles - she worked as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for the children and build the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his new path. 'My previous job wasn't artistic, but this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I really enjoy designing.' Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He works with great detail, always getting the customer's approval for the design before cutting it by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs in stock, as they are as popular as the custom ones. 'People like hand-crafted items,' Graham says. 'They like the chance to get something a bit different.' Graham does not plan to expand, as he wants to keep the business a rural craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want a unique touch for their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'Pricing,' he explains, 'depends on how complex the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a special gift.'"
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans earned him record-breaking amounts of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success story.

The start of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. His film project, *Life and Limb*, which he had worked on for months, suddenly failed. This left him worried because he hadn't earned money in two years, and the film was his only hope to appease his bank manager. Instead of finding a job, Evans made a bold decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.

The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. Such people were called 'horse whisperers'. Evans was fascinated and started researching the topic, initially planning to write a screenplay. However, after *Life and Limb* failed, he decided to write a book instead.

In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his future, as he was in debt and unsure how to support his family. By August, he had written half of the book and showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and estimated Evans might get $30,000 as an advance, which was less than Evans needed.

In October, Evans sent the first 200 pages and a 12-page summary to seven UK publishers before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000, sensing something bigger was happening. Within a week, the book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel. Hollywood studios also competed for the film rights, and Evans received an offer of $3 million.

Evans shared this story while we sat on the verandah of his home. He turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*, not wanting to become an employee of the studios. He preferred to stay involved at a distance. The success of his novel also brought new interest in *Life and Limb*, but Evans was unsure if he wanted to pursue it. He believed it would be wise to write another novel."
CAE_23,"Text: 'Young Masters Age is a challenge for Bobby Fischer as he tries to make a comeback. Chess is now more than ever a game for young people. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer has returned to chess to play against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was impressive, simple yet deep. However, as the following games showed, this older, bearded player is not the same as he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in the best shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer himself helped make chess more popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, the focus is more on winning than on the scientific and artistic aspects of the game. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intellect and wisdom. The pressure has always been high: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose the game. Now, games are longer, and many are played without breaks. This increased pressure benefits younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of the game happens off the board, not just in psychological battles that Fischer is known for. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially because computers have changed chess a lot. A small computer can store one million chess games and quickly show hundreds of games of a future opponent. In a recent match, each player had large teams working nonstop to find weaknesses in the other's strategy. The opening moves of a game are now studied in great detail. Being better prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, there are more top-level players than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters compete for modest prize money worldwide. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, a constant struggle for the chess master. A moment of lost focus can lead to disaster. Players are always tense, and the chess clock adds to this tension. The end of the game often involves a fast-paced 'time scramble'. In these moments, players have only seconds to make several moves or lose the game. With minds racing and hands moving quickly, they make their moves and press their clocks with coordination that any athlete would admire. These moments are not for calm thinkers. The game becomes a basic struggle where nerves, determination, and a strong will to win decide the winner. At the top level, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress and tiredness. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready to compete the next day. Most chess tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day, and there is a year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even tougher. The 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to stop after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about two stone (10kg) in weight. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his leaving the chess world after 1972 seem strange. But in some ways, it was a fitting end to his story. It made Bobby Fischer a legend. If he has returned for the money, he will do well. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer has come back truly believing he can prove he is still the best, the final result could be very disappointing.'"
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three plays that critics love. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" The amazing thing about Nick is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it causes. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has progressed a lot since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was practicing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comic group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The critics loved it, and his career took off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""I can now choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to be successful. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for more praise, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single *Chimera* is released soon. ""The record company talks about a smash hit, but I have no idea. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes and awards than many people twice his age. He is well-known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving critical acclaim, moving into novels is brave. ""There's a framework with my poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for bad words. My main goal is not to just produce work without caring about quality."""
CAE_1,"Text: A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to attract the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romances and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a fast-paced style like an old silent film, with chapter titles such as 'Our Hero Feels Inspired'. B. This story is about the beginning and near-end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of Francis With, a smart but weak child. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. He takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of dime stores, old cars, and the radio. C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. So, when professor Richard Vaisey falls for a Russian poetess, he talks to his wife's ex. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is in prison. However, the most interesting part is how the author solves these problems. He moves the story with humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a fun and smart read. D. Two pairs of best friends - two women and two men - meet in London in the sixties and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, James Hudson, an American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is good. This book is long and detailed, allowing readers to really get to know the characters. E. Written by a top American fiction writer, this funny and caring story is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for a mistake and becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is slowly becoming an odd bachelor surrounded by household mess. The story explores many emotions and focuses on Ian's touching relationship with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a lovely, warm book with a perfect mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism: Perspectives from Four Writers**

**A.** The direct impact of volunteer tourism on development is often questioned. Volunteers may help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a high fee to participate. This money, if given directly to local communities, could hire more workers than a single volunteer could replace. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack technical skills or experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are motivated by a genuine desire to help or by the chance to gain 'cultural capital' for their careers. However, these projects might help volunteers become more ethical and socially responsible in their future lives and careers.

**B.** Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, conflict resolution, and participation in global issues. It can also create international social networks. In this way, both volunteers and host communities benefit, contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by people from wealthier countries, it may only benefit these privileged individuals, giving them a career advantage, while doing little for communities without access to such opportunities. Volunteers may use these experiences for personal gain, treating host communities as steps on their career ladder.

**C.** At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as self-serving or as a form of charity that benefits the volunteer more than the community. At its best, it provides technical help and allows for an exchange of skills and cultural experiences. Importantly, volunteering can increase awareness and commitment to fighting inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

**D.** Volunteer tourism aligns with the trend of wanting to help others through personal actions. These efforts, aimed at 'making a difference,' can seem positive in a world skeptical of politics. They avoid big government and business, but also bypass democratic processes, reducing development to individual charity acts. While volunteering is commendable, when marketed as sustainable development, it can degrade the true meaning of development. This approach shifts focus away from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**

Many of us use a radio to wake up in the morning, and we often need an alarm to get us out of bed. That's where the clock radio comes in. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The first model has a 'dual alarm function,' but it doesn't work as expected. Instead of waking you with a buzzer and then letting you snooze, it allows you to set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model is priced similarly to the second one we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a nice bonus. You can fall asleep to your favorite tapes and wake up without news. We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but the size was a downside—it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

The second model was the most attractive and the overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, although the clock on his test model kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its grey numbers on a green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to tap with your eyes closed. However, the buttons are so smooth and inviting that I accidentally pressed them like piano keys, which was confusing. The clock has a self-power backup, so you don't have to reset it if the plug is pulled out. We all liked this feature, but setting it up was challenging, though it made us feel sophisticated once we figured it out.

Tom Granger found the third model, with its built-in lamp, to be poorly made. The lamp is hard to use, and the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer is loud and annoying, like an alarm on a submarine. Despite this, it's the third most popular model on the market.

The fourth model is aimed at young people with its bright colors and bootlace strap. Tom Granger and I liked its playful design. It was the only model we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be off by 10 minutes, which Paul Bridges found unacceptable.

The last model is the simplest and cheapest. Tom Granger liked it because it was standard and took up little space. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found intuitive. However, he admitted that button-tuning has improved radio quality. Paul Bridges and I thought the tuning was basic, but the radio quality was good. The buzzer worked well, getting me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"Text: 'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small animal known for the sharp spines covering its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, making their spines point outwards. This defense works well if the hedgehog has many spines. Some desert hedgehogs have fewer spines because they have evolved to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger and only roll into a ball as a last option. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, usually under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. If the conditions are right, some hedgehogs stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,"Text: 'Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women have to be even tougher. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite the challenges, they are overcoming prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to some brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals. A. Jill, 27, Skier ""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well or it's windy and you can't see, but you just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it's a young sport."" B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist ""Two years ago I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I am because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money. I do at least four hours' training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming, and running. My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he knows the time you have to put into it -- it would be impossible otherwise."" C. Annabel, 26, Rower ""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There's no continuity so the women's squad is basically a mess. But it's great fun and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life."" D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker ""At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too small, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different. The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had as far as pain is concerned. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk."" E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer ""Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been seen as unusual. It's great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection - always trying to get round with a perfect lap."" F. Alison, 28, Triathlete ""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I'd really be one, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together but when an event is covered in the press, 90 per cent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 per cent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it.""'"
CAE_34,"**The Day I Drew Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso, one of the most famous artists of the century. At 18 years old, Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He was low on money and found a job painting boats in Cannes. One day, while eating at a restaurant in Cannes harbor, he saw Picasso, who was known to be a private person. Picasso was sitting with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard approached Picasso and offered his sketchbook. To his surprise, Picasso signed it and added a drawing.

Richard was thrilled and started a conversation with Picasso, though they needed an American woman at the table to translate. She called Picasso ""the Maestro,"" and Richard told Picasso about his love for art. After showing his friend the autograph, his friend suggested Richard go back and draw Picasso's portrait. Richard returned to Picasso's table and began to draw him without asking for permission. Picasso noticed and made funny faces to make it difficult for Richard. Eventually, Picasso stopped and let Richard draw him seriously. Richard observed Picasso's youthful appearance and intense eyes.

When Richard finished, the American woman said Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Richard was embarrassed but showed it to him. Picasso nodded in approval and then decided to draw Richard. In a few quick strokes, Picasso drew a playful version of Richard's face. Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso declined, saying Richard already had his signature. Despite this, Richard felt lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks shops use to make you spend more.

**A. The Image of Freshness**

Supermarkets know that customers value fresh produce. They often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance or have a display of house plants to create a fresh image. An in-store bakery might spread the smell of fresh bread throughout the store. The store's colors, like green, can also enhance this fresh image. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, doesn't match this fresh image.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**

The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use computer systems to find the best spots for products. High-profit items or fast-selling products are placed in these areas. Shelves at eye level are popular because they sell better. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters. 'Complementation' is also used, like placing salad dressings near salads.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**

Supermarkets place basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting products. Chain stores do the same with popular items, placing them far from the entrance to encourage customers to explore the store.

**D. Less Sells More**

Chain stores have changed how they display products. The Next chain, for example, uses a 'boutique' style, showing fewer items to make them seem exclusive. This approach is more about good store design than the uniqueness of the clothes.

**E. Tempting Totals**

Shoppers often focus on the total bill rather than individual prices. Supermarkets mix low-profit staples with high-profit items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as 'loss leaders.' They also buy in bulk to get discounts from manufacturers.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**

In chain stores, shoppers buy fewer items and notice prices more. Pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing also helps reduce theft, as staff must record the sale to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**

Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully plan their lighting. Chain stores aim for natural light to show clothes' true colors. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh produce look better.

**H. Walk This Way**

Chain stores use different flooring to guide shoppers. One type of carpet marks the path through the store, while another marks sales areas. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas to encourage browsing.

**I. In-Store Promotion**

Supermarkets use large photos of delicious food to tempt hungry shoppers. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that show ads as you shop. These trolleys target impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"Text: 'Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington, 58, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, like Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Suhaili. He also broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979, I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin for an interview, and he invited me to join him for a sail. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat, and we paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The route was quite difficult, and I was impressed by how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He moved quietly along. After a bit, we reached a huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I finished, Robin politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I built a strong friendship. His idea to combine our skills on a trip to Greenland was just a bigger version of our Skye trip. Robin impressed me as a leader. Usually, the skipper makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel included. To be honest, I found the sailing difficult and boring. The moments of crisis were easy to handle: the adrenaline kicks in, and you get all worked up. The hard part was spending day after day in the middle of the sea. I love the land and am not really a do-it-yourself person. Robin, on the other hand, is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing things on the boat. I knew Robin didn't really need me. I felt a bit useless at times, which was hard. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least on a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other. When we reached Greenland, and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it hard to be responsible for Robin's life. There were many times climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the top, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down, we were falling asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went through a lot, but he trusted me completely. He just followed. When it got too difficult, and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece. Yet he was all for us trying to climb the mountain again. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself. The previous night I'd almost fallen asleep. I felt he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd misunderstood. While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted, sensitive person.'"
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, people spat out apple seeds, and 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which they developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but most did not suit the British climate. Norman varieties became more popular, and British monks developed new apples, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.

**Medieval Apples (1200)**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was the main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 to the 17th century, giving us the word 'costermonger' for a fruit seller. Apple production declined due to droughts, the Black Death, and wars. In the 16th century, Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple cultivation, leading to the first modern orchard in Kent.

**Apples Abroad (1750)**  
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed,' planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana.

**Modern Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, Jesse Hiatt discovered a new apple, which he named 'Hawkey.' It was later called 'Delicious' and became widely grown. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith discovered the Granny Smith apple in 1868. Known as 'Granny Smith,' she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit and cultivated it into a famous green apple.

**Uniformity and Diversity (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most commercial apples come from a few varieties chosen for their appearance and ability to travel, not taste. This uniformity reduces the variety of apples. While UK gardeners have preserved many old varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from 100 years ago. Consumers now want more variety, and we must protect natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Text: 'Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-metre runner, visits the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp. Ten miles south of the equator, a mountain track leads off the quiet road from Nairobi. This track is the start of the path up Mount Kenya, the highest peak in Kenya. This beautiful but isolated place is Nanyuki, where I have trained for the past three years during the winter. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth trip. During this visit, I competed in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp. This is where Kenya's best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I couldn't miss. Training at high altitude increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity. This has helped many Kenyan runners succeed. My first race in Africa, before staying at the camp, was also the first international cross-country race in Africa, held in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but three were Kenyan. I felt I hadn't run badly! However, I don't think Kenyan success is only due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple approach to the sport. Their running style looks easy, their diet is simple, and they are relaxed, but they love competing. The least discussed part of their success is perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay at the camp provided answers. The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by playing fields and tropical vegetation. It's basic, with few comforts. The athletes live with the college's regular students, six to a room in simple dormitories. Their days are filled with three workouts: an easy early-morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six. We got up from our bunks and were briefed by the coaches for the morning run. ""Run easy, you have a hard job today,"" the coach who invited me said. We ran about 40 kilometres each day, just short of a marathon. Sunday was different, with only one 20-kilometre run, a welcome break from the usual three workouts. Life outside running was simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth was enough before breakfast. Breakfast was tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After the day's running, we drove to bathe in streams from Mt Kenya's glaciers. By the time I left the camp, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It can't be just genetics, upbringing, or altitude. I thought about another reason: the simple lifestyle, hard workouts, and passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's rise in world distance running.'"
CAE_7,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**

Advertising is struggling, and it's not just because of the recession. The decline started in 1989, before the recession hit hard. The main issue is that advertising hasn't kept up with economic changes. Advertisers focus on mass markets and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, target markets have become smaller. Even big brand campaigns should aim at smaller audiences, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.

Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items, but only a few are advertised brands. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For big items like cars, you might buy one every three years, and many clothes you buy aren't advertised brands. Even with all the products and services you use, you likely don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.

Compare this to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. If we focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising, the average person buys only about 4% of them. So, the saying that half of advertising is wasted might be wrong; it could be 96% that's wasted, but no one knows which part.

When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 6%, meaning 94% of ads are wasted. You might think you're not influenced by ads, but most people don't buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product.

Advertising is still cost-effective because it reaches many people, even if only a few respond. Advertisers can't know exactly who will respond, so they have to reach a large audience. Even the best-targeted ads don't get a 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client.

If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they wouldn't need mass media. They could contact those people directly. Any campaign that gains 2% of the population as new customers is very successful. For advertising to improve, it needs to target its message more precisely."
CAE_43,"Text: 'Solar Survivor Charles Clover explores Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has some surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. Another is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', designed by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle sewage into garden compost, and heat their house with waste heat from appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and blends with the town's old buildings. It is in a conservation area but got approval from planners. The house is super-insulated with special windows, so it's very quiet inside. Once inside, you must take off your shoes. The house is very still and quiet. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Vale opens ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own air-locked door. The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have been interested in the environment for a long time. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed a building that emits no carbon dioxide and decided to do without mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to protect drinking water, which is filtered before use. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't use a dishwasher because they avoid strong detergents. 'We wanted to show that it was possible to design a house that is less harmful to the environment without living in the dark,' says Robert. The house's only medieval feature is its aesthetic: the hall, with a hearth and staircase, rises the full height of the building. The Vales pay no water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is what other houses use on top of heating. Soon, solar panels will be installed, and the house will generate more electricity than it uses. There will even be enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, used only in the coldest winter. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room temperature was 18C, which is comfortable because there are no draughts or heat loss. An Edwardian lady in the early 1900s was comfortable at 12.5C because of her clothing. People in old houses should live like they did back then, he suggests, but this idea might not catch on. The house is low-tech, with little to go wrong. Most materials were from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making it cheap to build. Commercial builders are not interested in this idea.'"
CAE_51,"Text: 'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational man, even a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies taken in a garden, he believed they were scientific proof that these tiny creatures existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were supernatural wonders. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick challenges a basic idea of photography, that the camera cannot lie. But it can, and always could. Today, we are used to computer software that lets us change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a true age of innocence. From the moment cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"Text: 'Blacksmiths Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and blacksmiths have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created the beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were made by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architecture rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs. In the past 10 years, there has been a revival due to more interest in decorative architecture and a more open approach to interior design. Still, much of the work seems old-fashioned: makers of gates and balconies often call their products 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Trendy design stores often sell rusty candlesticks with decorations. Fortunately, there are new options, and several events in the coming weeks aim to promote blacksmithing. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says: 'We might be entering a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.' Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it easily. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.' About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most of the money will go to the makers, 'but a percentage of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork,' says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. 'My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,' he says. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes rigid and unmovable again.' Ann Catrin Evans' steel door-knockers and handles seem inspired by the castles in horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And it feels like it will last forever.' No other base metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. Iron will likely be used decoratively for the next thousand years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks.'"
CAE_14,"Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. 'What do you mean?' she shouted. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I guess my inability to explain how one afternoon I was a pack-a-day smoker, and four hours later I was not, was a bit annoying. I find it strange myself. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had not planned to stop and I did not even really want to. For one thing, I was annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups - and I still am. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I did not cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds more easily than friends with healthier lifestyles. On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. 'I won't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I said firmly. 'Since my reason for being here is writing, not stopping, it would not be right to expect your method to work on me.' I thought I was being reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me knowingly. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted and most of the afternoon was in a room so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke, I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others. I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of stopping began to feel appealing. The possibility of not being a smoker was starting to make me feel strong. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world? In many ways, it was easy. The physical craving, the desire for nicotine, in the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two and I felt them for only four or five days. The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the hardest to do without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines without nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story on time. Surprisingly, spending time at home on weekend mornings was the hardest thing - and it still is. I am starting to think that for me smoking had a lot to do with avoiding boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be faced - eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theatre break. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes.'"
CAE_63,"Text: Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet she is not well-known in her own country. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's first biography, has noticed that many people in Britain are unaware of Hodgkin's achievements. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person. Her life mirrored significant changes in the 20th century, such as the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When Ferry started her research, she looked into scientific biographies and found that even famous scientists like Linus Pauling, who won Nobel Prizes in chemistry and peace, were not widely recognized in British bookstores. This lack of interest in scientific biographies might be due to the belief that scientists' lives are less interesting than those of artists or writers. However, this view is changing as more scientists appear in public roles outside of their scientific work, making them more relatable to the public.

The publishing world is also evolving. Scientific biographies used to be dry and focused only on work, but now they include personal aspects of scientists' lives. Books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" have shown that scientists can have fascinating personal stories. Even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are now portrayed with their personal flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work, solving the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, which won her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She also managed a family life with three children and a husband who was often away. Her ability to balance her personal and professional life is inspiring. Understanding the passion behind scientific work is challenging for biographers, as many readers may not have the scientific background to fully grasp complex ideas. However, it is important to recognize the contributions of scientists like Hodgkin, just as we do with literary or artistic figures."
CAE_56,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel rod to find water underground. Many farmers, whose wells have dried up, ask for her help. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs a forked hazel stick. They succeed in finding water more than 90% of the time.

Dowsing is the skill of finding water, minerals, and lost objects underground. It is often called a 'sixth sense'. There are many ideas about how it works. Some think it is physical, like magnetism, while others think it is spiritual. One believable idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers might be able to sense these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' water, while others say they can smell it, as smell is a very strong sense.

The Wilkins have been very busy during recent droughts, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, 'We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time.' Other customers have remote cottages or barns, now used as holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. Some customers are golf-course developers who need water for clubhouse facilities.

Margaret tries to find water 50 to 70 meters deep. 'You can't drill a well where farm or other waste might get into the water supply. The water we find is in cracks of solid rock, and if we bring it straight up, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, you have to watch out for iron because the area is rich in minerals.' Another important thing is electricity to power the pump. It is too costly to run electricity over long distances, so the well should be near existing power supplies.

After considering all this, Margaret starts looking for water. On large areas like golf courses, she begins with a map and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and move it over the map. It swings when it is over an area with water.' After the map shows possible areas, Margaret walks over the fields with a forked hazel stick. 'When I'm above water, I feel something strange; I sway a bit. When it stops, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill.' She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly outward. 'When water is right below, the straight part of the stick rises. It's important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If you drill even a little off, you can miss the water completely. My husband also checks the area; usually, we agree on where to drill. If we don't agree, we keep looking until we do.'

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in practicing this old tradition in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been interested in this mysterious skill. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment', and that is the best way to understand how she finds water so well. If she didn't have this 'sixth sense', how could her family continue their well-drilling business year after year?"

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different? We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, 30, who works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant. Amanda had never been in such a lively place before. It was very different from her hometown, and she wasn't sure she could handle it. Being a mother is busy, but this was something else! She had just 15 minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but Amanda dropped the drinks, and they crashed to the floor. She was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.

By opening time at 11:30 am, a queue had already formed outside, and Amanda felt nervous. She worried about remembering orders, but everything was automated. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she couldn't get used to the loud music. She had to keep saying ""Pardon?"" to customers, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and wanted to soak her feet. She was surprised when a waitress said it had been a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized waitressing was tiring and required a bubbly personality and a cool head. She was glad to return to her children, as it seemed easier than waitressing.

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for the day. She was warned the girls were cheeky, but she thought she could handle it. After Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls. She thought she'd have three hours of peace after dropping them off, but she was wrong. Amanda left a note reminding her to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing. At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. When Sophie came home from school, the real trouble started. The girls turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly. Cindy thought they'd get tired, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. She realized how tiring it was to look after two small children and the responsibility was overwhelming. Even so, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm and swapped with Hilary, 30, a primary school teacher. On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a luxury. She worried about what to wear and hoped she blended in at the school assembly. In a maths class, children worked in small groups, which was different from her school days. She helped with a nature project and was exhausted by lunchtime, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. After lunch, she attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class. Teachers may get more holidays, but Rosemary decided to stick to farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream. Hilary spent the morning bottling milk and making ice-cream. At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two-and-a-half hours. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The worst part was not being able to take time off, as the cows need milking twice a day. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is different, with irregular income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in southern Sweden, is now a famous trumpet player at the age of 30. His records introduce new music, including concertos by forgotten composers and new works. When you meet him, he seems younger than his age, with a fresh and open manner like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a top London concert hall, and a TV feature showed his work and development in Sweden and the UK. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift at age eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, gave him a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother found a teacher, Bo Nilsson from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, who saw his talent. Hardenberger is grateful for having such a dedicated teacher who loved the trumpet and connected with players worldwide. Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is imperfect, and he learned to work with its flaws. From the start, he had a unique sound. Unlike John Wallace, a British trumpet player who started in brass bands, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter who also avoided orchestras. His parents supported his dream, and at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud advised against joining an orchestra, comparing it to gardening. Hardenberger knew he played better than others his age, but at 17, he realized he had a special gift for connecting with audiences. Thibaud suggested he enter a competition for experience. He only prepared for the first round but reached the final. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and learned that people listened to him even if he thought he played poorly. Hardenberger is realistic about his talent and doesn't try to explain his gift for communication, believing that music's power is in its ability to move people.'"

Checking their work can cause conflict, so we keep communication open. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but act immediately if something important happens. I usually leave the site at 6pm and am on call all the time.'"
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**

I wake up at 6 am and reach the office by 7.30 am. I manage customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future developments. I have meetings scheduled most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. There are nine customer service units around Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**

I start work at 10.00 am and go through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing at about 10.30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists, involving the press, marketing, and the managing director. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be constructive because they represent people's hard work. I know instinctively if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I communicate my vision of the album to the company for marketing and sales. I also oversee budgets and spending. I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and often go to gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. After a gig, I might visit an artist in the studio. Most of my social life is related to work, and I often get home at 1.00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work, arriving at 9.30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from London salerooms, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with a full-time restorer and liaise with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts once a month and the tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work a set shift pattern, and on early shifts, I leave home at 6.00 am. At 7.00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working for about an hour and a half at a station, then taking a half-hour break before returning to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work as a team to control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am. It's important to be alert in this job, so I don't hesitate to take sick leave if I'm unwell. The work is stressful, and it takes time to unwind after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually a general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**

If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is at the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be annoying when they expect you to gather a pile of books based on reviews. Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm on weekdays, publishers' representatives visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the coming months. I decide how many copies of a title the shop might sell. When featuring a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the computer system, locking up, and going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8.45 am. I contact our freelance reporters to learn about events in the region I'm responsible for. I assess financial risk for multinational companies operating abroad, warning clients of potential issues in a country. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9.15 am to 9.30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first executive preview is due online by 10.00 am, and my second deadline is 11.00 am, so I quickly follow up on stories. I type them, send them to my editor for approval, then make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events or stay informed. I leave work around 6.00 pm. It's hard to switch off, and I'm often awake until 1.00 am."
CAE_45,"Text: 'Career Power: Take Control at Work

A. What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires and guides others. Leadership is not about being tall or very intelligent. Pat Dixon, author of ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are.' Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, 'It's having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"".'

B. John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says, 'Most people have more potential for leadership than they realize. Becoming a leader means recognizing, developing, and using those hidden talents.' We all have the ability to be leaders; we just need the right situation. While it's easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it can be harder to see it in our own workplace. Yet, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you've had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve them? The best leader motivated and supported you. The worst made you feel unimportant and kept information from you, blaming you when things went wrong. The first led well; the second just managed poorly.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like working within set rules. Leaders create new opportunities. 'A good manager can keep a company running smoothly,' writes Michael Shea, author of ""Leadership Rules."" 'But a good leader can transform a struggling organization, whether it's a company, a sports team, or a nation.'

E. Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:
* Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and take action.
* Think of yourself as a leader. Recognize your ability to lead.
* Collaboration is good, but sometimes firm leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually ask for others' opinions, try taking the lead. See how this changes the outcome.
* Set goals and exceed them. Look at your job and find areas where being a leader will improve your effectiveness and career.

F. * Leadership develops from taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.
* Don't assume your way of leading will win over everyone. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be.
* Be visible and accessible to important people. But remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your contribution is vital and how you can help others become leaders.'"
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, like foreman Bud, remind us of heroes in Howard Hawks' movies. The production design and special effects are impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, focusing on a soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer, but Marton's has its moments, like the harsh flashback of the soldier dreaming of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
Based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer films. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, and Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil is a bit too serious for this fun film, but he still shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film uses costume-drama clichés with wit and charm.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 20th-century Rotterdam, this film is visually detailed but feels like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is ruthless with tenants. The story focuses on his tense relationship with his son, but the filmmakers seem more interested in the period details than the dark story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video highlights director Leone's skills. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, but Morricone's music adds excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck features 'forty-eight international stars' and many extras. With four directors, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow. Logistically impressive, it is better suited for the big screen. On video, it loses some of its impact."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A**  
Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is truly engaging. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the verdict uncertain until the end, and there is a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B**  
*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement and throws Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder. We are confident he will solve the mystery. The plot is complex and the book is a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C**  
*File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, created by first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a strange man dies at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is determined and successful.

**BOOK D**  
In *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker, private investigator Spenser helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, with more philosophy than violence. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E**  
*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and insight into human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F**  
*Blood Red, Snow White* is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features a lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book mixes romance, money, and violence to create a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G**  
*Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher, who becomes a target. A funny group of characters gathers to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels his career is not going well. While entertaining, this book does not meet Shaw's usual high standards.

**BOOK H**  
*Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are after a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this a standout detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning a salary. I realized I was giving up my own happiness for my salary. When I resigned, it felt like I was in control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I'm not in a relationship, and I have no big career goals. I feel I should make the most of my freedom, even for my friends' sake! Why am I nervous? First, it's about making the necessary arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? How would I organize the rental? And I had to decide where to go. I'm a terrible procrastinator and am already weeks behind my plan. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Cutting emotional ties makes it harder. I'm delaying because, deep down, I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. It's becoming common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to leave their lives and travel. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet, says people are realizing they can have adventures if they are brave, organized, and confident. For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a thought that I'm not moving up the career ladder, but it's a risk you have to take. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things. I needed to change this to live as a civilian.' There are many reasons to travel at my age, but there are common factors. 'We have a more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Big companies are even allowing career breaks. 'If you've spent time and money training someone, it's nice to know they'll come back rather than work for a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more people in their thirties are rethinking their lives. 'If you're not happy with what you're doing, it's not about just sticking with it. Now people know opportunities exist, and a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel offers a chance to reassess and think about your life.' Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's struggle with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less worried about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We're taking the time to ask, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to get things I want for myself.' But he does feel some fear. 'It's the thought of leaving behind a comfortable routine - just going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having a cup of coffee.' I share Ben's worries about leaving a stable life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I'd be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is common. There's often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job. Such events can push people to go and do it.' It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. Whatever happens, I'll be happy to have taken control of my life. And in that, I'm sure I speak for all of us older backpackers."""

She shares how she turned her family home into an efficient workplace. The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career, which seemed lost due to technology. My resume showed I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. It seemed unlikely anyone would hire me to use a computer in a newsroom. Many jobs required desktop publishing experience, which I didn't have. I felt I had a better chance of teaching nuclear physics than using a computer for layout. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators confused me, and I couldn't use the video timer. Clearly, I needed to act quickly to save my career. Leaving home before the children did seemed difficult until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a success story you hear about, my family and I won a computer package. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We entered a new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became common in our vocabulary. We started chatting with strangers around the world via the Internet. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone-answering machine, a fax, a CD-ROM, and a modem for Internet access. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take the children to school. The children were confident with computers from school. I was more hesitant, worried I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Though not an expert, I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical, easy, and foolproof. With perseverance, you learn more each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel I have the best of both worlds. How has the computer helped me? Since school, I worked at a messy desk and often lost important notes. The computer made me organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help track income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads save time. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide. If this sounds too good to be true, there is a downside to working from home. You can feel isolated from people. There are distractions like urgent house chores, and when the children are home, we argue over who uses the computer. However, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment. In my street, a new type of home business is growing because people don't have to commute to the city. So what characterizes home workers as we move into the next century? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes describes the typical computer user: 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, and 32% have a CD-ROM; 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I seem to be ahead of schedule. Who knows, one day I might email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publish my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or should I say cyberspace, is the limit.'"
CAE_59,"Text: 'The Tartan Museum The modern, cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are its contents as striking? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened. You cannot miss it. The Museum of Scotland is unmissable, located on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large, yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings, topped by a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reviews: some praised it as a 'masterpiece', others were cautious, calling it 'striking', and some were hostile. This winter, as the inside is almost ready for opening, the exhibitions might receive similar reactions. The museum tells a nation's story in a chronological way. It is a collection of stories, each centered around a historic object, with a timeline to guide visitors without restricting the displays. It does not let national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver, be overshadowed by national pride. The real question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes a visit should be a pleasurable, visual experience, designed for those with little prior knowledge. Clarke is a purist about what is shown. He avoids mock-ups and imaginative scenes from the past, as they give a false sense of certainty about history. He believes the public deserves the truth. At this museum, what you see is what experts know. The question is whether the objects' stories can be told vividly enough with explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, using only about 30 computers in the museum. Less than three days before opening, it's hard to be sure. Some impressions are clear, though, and it's not just the views of Edinburgh Castle that are impressive. Inside, the sequence of spaces is striking. Galleries open into one another, with different sizes and shapes, pale wood-paneled walls that look like stone, and deep display cases. Daylight streams through narrow windows and from the roof. There is space to enjoy every item on display. Thanks to a 12-member Junior board, set up three years ago with 9- to 12-year-olds from all over Scotland, the museum has a Discovery Centre. The group wanted to ride through the displays, but instead got a dedicated children's hands-on center in what was supposed to be the temporary exhibition gallery. As a result, the Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor, is the only temporary exhibition. It will change after three years and is a mix of objects chosen by Scottish people and others as items that impacted life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister suggested an electric guitar. Others chose televisions, Thermos flasks, and favorite toys. Although the idea is fun, it feels like a lightweight solution, not a serious attempt to address important issues. It may seem more substantial when the computerised bank of personal reasons and recollections goes live next week. Overall, Dr. Clarke seems right when he says 'objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else'. As for the modernist architecture: it works well from the inside and the top, but whether it fits the location is another question.'"
CAE_54,"Text: 'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition is a comforting idea. Change can be scary for some and challenging for others. But transition means moving smoothly from the present to the future. However, the transition of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe it will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are dropping while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen print sales fall by 8% to 10% year-on-year, but their website visits are rising. This trend depends on timing, demography, and geography. Experts say print is declining, but there are some things that don't fit this narrative. Global newspaper circulation rose by 1.1% last year, with sales in Asia making up for declines in the West. News magazines, expected to suffer in the digital age, actually saw a 5.4% increase. Similarly, e-readers like Kindle are popular, but physical book sales only fell by 0.4%. It's not just screen or paper; it's both. Claims that young people are abandoning newspapers are exaggerated. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read national dailies. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales fell by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline was only 7%, and in France, just 3.1%. These differences suggest a more complex situation than expected. In the US, online advertising was supposed to support online newspapers, but digital ad revenues are falling. Now, 360 US papers have paywalls, and the best way to attract paying readers is to offer print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print ads earn much more than online ads. This situation is challenging for newspaper companies because maintaining both print and online editions is costly. However, newspaper brands still have a strong presence in print, and being noticed online is harder.'"
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well is challenging. Besides technical and artistic aspects, photographers must consider actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act unnaturally.

**A. GROUPING PEOPLE**

Avoid straight lines in group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, or on different levels. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or raise your viewpoint.

**B. POSING FOR PICTURES**

People often act unnaturally in front of a camera. They may become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. THE RIGHT APPROACH**

Don't pretend you aren't taking a picture when you clearly are, as this creates tension. Most people will agree to be photographed, though they might protest at first. They may become self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject looks aimlessly away.

**D. EYE CONTACT**

A photo has more impact if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but not necessarily to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them before you take the shot. You can also say something funny to get a genuine reaction.

**E. CANDID CONCENTRATION**

Instead of direct eye contact, the subject can focus on something in the picture. This might be easier for them, and the viewer can follow their gaze. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is important.

**F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES**

Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the subject. A laughing child makes the viewer smile, while a sad expression evokes sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like shrugs, winks, or thumbs-up. They are a universal visual language.

**G. SITUATION INTEREST**

While close-up shots have impact, the background can add interest and information. Exclude irrelevant details or blur them by focusing selectively. Ensure the subject isn't overwhelmed by the background. A wide-angle lens can make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. INTERACTION**

When people are talking, arguing, or working together, there are chances for good photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams make appealing shots. Look for contact between subjects, like eye contact or a handshake, or wait for an animated expression.

**I. PEOPLE AND PLACES**

Many photos of people are taken on holiday to show the places they visit. To show people against a background, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole scene. Ask your subjects to come close to the camera and compose the picture so they form a foreground without blocking the background. An elevated camera position can help. A good picture balances the subjects and the place.

**J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?**

Decide why you want to take the picture. If it's to remember someone you met briefly, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all formal poses. Candid pictures of events are more lively, and you get natural shots when you know the subject well. A spontaneous picture will remind the family of the moment better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. Her paintings trick the eye by creating the illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.

Sarah Janson is one of the few artists who do not sign their work unless asked. She believes the work is more important than the artist. Janson is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes her a challenging interview subject. She admits, ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" and is uncomfortable being photographed.

However, once she relaxes, the interview becomes interesting and funny. Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But illustration did not satisfy her. She then worked with a decorator, Jim Smart, who introduced her to trompe-l'oeil. This changed her career path. Her skills in observation and detail, developed through illustration, are crucial for her work in trompe-l'oeil.

Janson believes that trompe-l'oeil cannot be taught; it is learned through life and observation. She insists she is still learning and is honest about her challenges, like painting bread, which she says looks like ""grey concrete."" She also struggled with the math needed for a large project at Lulworth Castle, doubting herself by thinking, ""You're not Michelangelo.""

Janson often talks about her work as if someone else did it, showing her modesty. Her trompe-l'oeil work is highly regarded, with many corporate and private commissions. Her art is often inspired by architecture, like a dining room based on a Venetian palace or a painting that makes a corridor look like it leads to more rooms.

Trompe-l'oeil must first trick the viewer and then engage their imagination. Janson believes it should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients, saying, ""That is where the ideas are born."" Some clients know what they want, while others need guidance. Janson values the relationship with her clients, many of whom become friends.

Janson appreciates her clients, especially those who trust her with their walls. Despite her modesty, she is always busy. She repeats, ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" preferring her work to speak quietly. But her work and personality are anything but boring, and they deserve more recognition."
CAE_61,"Text: 'Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' needed to reach the top of your career. A The rules for work are changing. We are now judged not only by our intelligence or training but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It can show who might become a top performer and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs, no matter what field we work in. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not enough. This new measure assumes we have the basic intelligence and skills for our jobs. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence. B In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are important at work. These have been called 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills'. Now, they are known as 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage our own and others' feelings, and using these feelings to guide our actions. At work, it includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some think it means just 'being nice', but sometimes it requires being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. It doesn't mean expressing all feelings freely, but managing them so they help people work well together. C More businesses see that emotional intelligence is important for management. The more complex the job, the more these skills matter. Lack of emotional intelligence can limit the use of technical skills or intelligence. Some people succeed despite flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex, companies where people work well together have an advantage. In today's workplace, with a focus on teamwork and customer service, emotional intelligence is essential for success everywhere. D Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life experiences. Studies show that people often get better at managing emotions, motivating themselves, and improving social skills. This growth in emotional intelligence is sometimes called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can add these skills to help us succeed. This is important when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling companies, but ignoring it can make other efforts less effective.'"
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important events, but social media has changed citizen photography even more. News often breaks on social networks, so some journalists use them to find images when events happen quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Even though there is guidance saying images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is strong public interest, people still debate if this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, so UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure people are properly rewarded for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**

Acupuncture is a practice that is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many conditions, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**A. What is Acupuncture?**

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can cause illness. An acupuncturist will try to find where the Qi is unbalanced by checking your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health and habits. They use fine needles inserted into the skin to help the flow of Qi. Sometimes, they also use heat or pressure on certain points.

**B. Over Three Hundred Points**

The points used in acupuncture are related to meridians and may not be near the area of pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling shows the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 main points, with many more used less often.

**C. How Does Science Explain It?**

Even without accepting traditional Chinese principles, Western doctors agree that acupuncture can help with pain. They have scientific explanations for how it might work. For example, stimulating certain nerves might block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some scientists think acupuncture points release natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.

**D. What Pain Can Be Treated?**

Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use for an Ancient Treatment**

Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This convinced some Western doctors that acupuncture is more than just a mental effect. In China, it is used in many surgeries, including heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with drugs. It is said to reduce pain, but results vary. Acupuncture anesthesia has no side effects like nausea, and recovery is quicker.

**F. Is It Always Effective?**

Clinical trials for acupuncture are hard to conduct, but some show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with this success rate but admit it doesn't work for everyone. For chronic pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel relief, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.

**G. A Different Approach to Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They spend time diagnosing and finding weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider external factors like weather and the type of pain. This approach is different from that of a typical medical doctor.

**H. Traditional or Not?**

Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional Chinese medicine can deep changes and long-term cures be achieved. It is important to choose an acupuncturist carefully, and they should refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,"Text: P.D. James, whose full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, is a famous crime writer. She seems calm and confident, like she could have been a headmistress if she hadn't written detective stories. However, she admits that this confidence hides her shyness. Her famous detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is based on how she imagines she would be if she were a man. Like Dalgliesh, she prefers to work alone, especially when writing. She needs privacy to write and doesn't agree that she is Britain's most famous crime writer, even though her 12 detective novels are loved worldwide. P.D. James admires her friend Ruth Rendell's psychological novels, written under the name Barbara Vine. She enjoys books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but also reads male authors like Graham Greene. P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, Connor Bantry White, a student at the university. Her life has been challenging; her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work hard to support him and their two daughters. Her husband's parents helped care for the children. While working full-time for the National Health Service, she managed several psychiatric clinics. Later, she worked at the Home Office in the Police Department and the Criminal Law section. During this time, she became used to seeing corpses but was more interested in the structure of crime novels than in death itself. She always wanted to be a writer and saw detective stories as a way to learn how to write serious novels. Writing detective stories allowed her to bring order to chaos and show the value of life, even if the life was not lovable. She believes nobody truly likes violence."
CAE_5,"The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you might be asked for a handwriting sample. This sample could help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help identify certain illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and show psychological states and emotional issues. Handwriting analysis is being used more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to study the handwriting of job candidates for important positions. However, most doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about graphology's value. Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, believes they should take it more seriously. She thinks handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also assess mental ability, whether a person should focus on arts or sciences, and if they have a devious or open character.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be useful in identifying possible criminal tendencies: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have stopped developing emotionally. This often appears in childish handwriting and in going over letters several times. I can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees."" ""Young male offenders often have very high ascenders, showing they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can tell if violence is likely, if the writer is under extreme pressure, and if there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can predict potential suicides."" Heart and lung problems can also appear, she says. ""You can't diagnose from one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if it changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there's a break in the signature that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A severe emotional upset can also show in a temporarily changed signature, she says.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. People whose letters form 'threads' instead of being individually formed are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to hide their true selves. Very light pressure shows sensitivity and lack of energy. Originality in handwriting—how much the writer has changed from standard script—shows confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word shows intolerance and a patronizing attitude. Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, combined with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. This will happen soon, she thinks. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions they might answer incorrectly.""

As interesting as this sounds, there is little solid evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is a result of education, artistic ability, and the type of writing taught—and has no other significance."
CAE_41,"Text: 'Is your office working well? Fresh air and the right chairs are important for a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as working environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies people's working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, and windows open directly to the street. It is hard to see why this space works, but the team of seven people seem happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like at home. This might be the key: they have created a homely environment without external rules.
Ergonomist: The furniture is mismatched and often creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. However, the staff have a varied work schedule, which they control, reducing fatigue and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said the office was 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to focus on personal work. The office is attractive and fun, showing efficiency and creativity.

Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and not disliked by staff. Air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good. Space is adequate, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a maternity rights poster. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by rearranging desks for easier information sharing and displaying project information on walls.

Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office gives mixed feelings. It feels like being in a glass case, viewing similar exhibits. Despite smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air is not stale.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are adequate, but not all chairs meet requirements. Computer screens are on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is outdated.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are supportive and well-served by technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet give a sombre effect. The office is busy.

Office D: Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning is crude, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and desk space is inadequate. The office is dusty, and the roof collects dust, which falls on people below.
Ergonomist: The furniture is more suited to a workshop than a high-tech industry. Most chairs are not suitable for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack adjustment, and have armrests that prevent getting close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust, and dirt everywhere. The place needs cleaning, individual success should be recognized, and air conditioning needs improvement—there are many smokers. Few conversations were happening; everyone seemed stressed by deadlines. The company needs a team-working policy.'"
CAE_38,"Text: 'Chewing Gum Culture Chewing gum is popular and classless, with Americans chewing 12 million sticks every day. Learn how this ancient habit became a big business. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered a food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. Modern gum is mostly synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve texture. This wasn't always true. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists copied the Amero-Indians of New England by chewing resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum there. Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have failed, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the market grew. Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances to tap sapodilla trees in very humid conditions. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Despite these risks, chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap. They carry the liquid to a camp, where it is boiled into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with a simple maize-based diet and local alcohol. Despite the harsh conditions, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. once imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were tapped in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetics to cut costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. Gum is said to help you relax, boost energy, and reduce tension. Soldiers in both world wars were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay. Plaque acid from eating causes decay, but saliva neutralizes the acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride. Gum makers say chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow. Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to blend the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still need natural help. Also, 137 square kilometers of America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world.'"

Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian symbolism. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**

The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favorite hotels. I discovered it by chance while climbing. After reaching the peak of a glacier, we walked down and found this hotel. It is in a beautiful, wild, and high location. Arriving tired from the climb and finding luxury, with someone playing Cole Porter on the piano, was amazing.

**C. MAURITIUS - BEACHCOMBER PARADIS HOTEL**

Located on the southwest of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is on its own peninsula in a quiet part of the island. The road to the hotel winds along the coast past empty beaches. The hotel is not small, and many people enjoy the free watersports, but you can find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. In the evening, when everyone leaves, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**

The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia is in a dramatic setting. It is quiet and remote, standing 1,000 feet high, with open rooms offering views of the Pitons and the Caribbean Sea. The style is colonial, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture, and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**

This hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a perfect escape from Istanbul's noise. The islands are an hour by boat and are idyllic, with no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden architecture from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel is a landmark, painted white with red domes, resembling a hotel from the French Riviera. It is a bit run down now but still charming.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**

In the village of Etoges, in the heart of Champagne, is a beautiful 17th-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with swans, the chateau was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one with a billiard table. There are special weekend rates that include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**

The Fairview is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel without excessive luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers resting from one safari and planning the next. Some guests decide to stay longer after seeing the gardens, rooms, and dining menu. The hotel is on Nairobi Hill, away from the city's busy center. It's a great place to watch the African sunset while enjoying a drink and a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**

The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guest book at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet a billionaire or heiress. This former monastery-turned-hotel is still splendid, with simple yet delicious food and fine Persian rugs."
CAE_47,"Text: Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they meet certain standards. Christopher Middleton watched her inspect the Globe Hotel. Right from the start, things were not going well for the hotel. The receptionist was busy on the phone and did not notice Sue. Sue whispered, ""Very poor,"" because the receptionist did not greet them. This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. The Globe Hotel is special because it has three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide Sue works for. But Sue was not impressed. The entrance from the car park was through an empty door with a buzzer and a long, empty corridor. Sue said, ""Again, not what I had expected.""

Things got worse when the receptionist said they had no record of Sue's booking. Most of the hotel's rooms were empty that night. Sue's room was on the top floor, but she did not like it. It was stuffy, and there was a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. Sue is known for being tough, but she says she is not too harsh. The next morning, after paying her bill, Sue told the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she was. He looked worried. Before Sue said anything, he apologized for a bad smell in the lounge. He thought there was a blocked drain. Sue suggested not taking guests to that lounge until it was fixed. Greaves agreed and took notes. He had only been at the hotel for five months and hoped Sue's feedback would help improve the hotel.

Not everything was bad. Sue praised Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a waitress, for their good work. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asked what they needed to do to get three rosettes. Sue said they should not serve a dessert that falls apart. Sue's job is to say what other guests might be too afraid to say. Sometimes people complain about her, but she has to tell the truth. Sue writes a full report for the hotel after her visit. Hotels pay to be in the guide, so they want to know how to improve. The good news for Greaves was that Sue would not recommend taking away the hotel's red stars. But another inspector would visit in the next two months to check if things were better. Greaves said, ""Good,"" but he did not sound very happy."
CAE_48,"**Seven Up: Climbing the Seven Summits**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the highest peak on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this quest later in life and describes each climb in the order he completed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the summit. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, likely due to lack of oxygen. Doug also found himself talking to his feet, worried about frostbite. Despite these challenges, Doug felt confident with Dougal and managed to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
Known as a dangerous mountain, Doug and Dougal arrived in April 1976. They carried their equipment and food on their backs, a style called 'alpine style'. The climb was tough due to low air pressure, making it feel higher than it was. They reached the summit after several challenging days.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite planned to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle, struggling to find water. Eventually, they found a trail and reached the summit using the Umbwe route.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, joined a group climbing via the Polish Glacier. Due to time constraints, they switched to the standard route. They reached the summit and met climbers aiming to complete the Seven Summits, inspiring Doug to consider the same goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica. Despite harsh weather, they reached the summit in eight hours. The experience was uplifting, even though visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In summer 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they used a cableway to reach 3,900m and then walked to a refuge. They faced strong winds and icy slopes but eventually reached the summit.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
Doug's team aimed to establish a new route and interact with the local Dani people. Despite warnings of danger, they climbed the mountain. On May 12, they reached the summit, marking Doug's completion of the Seven Summits.

Doug Scott's journey to climb the Seven Summits was filled with challenges and triumphs, culminating in a sense of accomplishment."

FCE_19,"Text: 'Five-star luxury meets modern technology The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened after nearly two years of work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. This project allowed the hotel to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name. For details of guests' preferences, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will pay for itself over time. He praises its efficiency and the facilities it offers. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible thanks to the guest-history feature, which allows staff to record any number of preferences. Hotel guests often complain about room temperature. Another high-tech system controls this important comfort area. Guests can change the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C, and each room can be adjusted between 14°C and 25°C at the front desk. For guests, the technology in their rooms is likely to be most appreciated, especially by business users. MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five percent of his business will come from this market. To meet these needs, the hotel has put the traditional business center into individual bedrooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. Extra cables have been installed to handle new advances. The televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be replaced with newer models anytime. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed. Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann says they have tried not to make guests feel overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, comfortable, and welcoming. There are also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As in all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he moved his business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel has benefits for both him and the hotel. He designed a new kitchen and brought it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at his previous location. For the hotel, they offer a popular and successful place to eat with no financial risks. With technology and a capable staff, the Merrion looks likely to succeed.'"

Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. 'It was really his garden,' she says. 'We got along well. At first, he didn't agree with some of my ideas, but when I explained I wanted to paint them, he understood.' Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden, though sometimes she paints groups of plants as they are. Usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't set everything up at once,' she says. 'I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one.' Sometimes, it takes years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She also finds the way flowers change as they decay interesting. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day. 'At first, they seem boring, but they change with twists and turns.' Susan has always loved plants: 'I studied botany at school and collected wildflowers,' she says. 'I didn't like garden flowers then; they looked fake to me. I was fascinated by wildflowers growing in difficult places.' Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and plenty of subjects to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_13,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the terrible storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This changed how the town center looked, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police, would have been upset too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forgetful and short-tempered. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. She took him to get his medicine and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen during the night, but Pelham couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he asked about damage to the house, was relieved to hear there was none, and went back to sleep. On Saturday, when the medicine started working and his fever went down, he got up and was shocked to see the walnut tree was gone. This changed how the living room looked. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham didn't regret buying it. The garden made it feel private. But now, the storm changed everything. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it made nice patterns of light and shade that hid the old furniture they brought from their last house. With the tree gone, the room was very bright, showing all the old furniture. The view from the window was also bad. The tall house next door, which the tree used to hide, was now visible with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It seemed to have many windows looking at the Pelhams' house. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"Text: 'Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed but the branches stayed firm. Yet, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient but not a big problem. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that threatened us the most. It reminded us of what could have happened if the water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago. Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high up in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was close to danger level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water surged over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream seemed wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks furiously. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down. Many times before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow and usually all is well; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can now enjoy, rather than fear, the big clouds that hang over the valley, and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure.'"
FCE_21,"Film Critic Mark Adams reflects on his last ten years working for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he reviewed novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did various tasks for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and TV. Tom hired him, but he wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have been more careful in choosing his team. 

Tom's idea was to have a group of critics cover art forms that didn't need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose what to cover, with guests to keep it social. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and Mark was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. Mark even thought it was as likely as a millionaire wanting to help him personally. He lacked self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to his review, he felt awkward.

Tom's plan for a team of critics didn't work out. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. The public preferred reviewers to focus on one subject, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initial push, they wouldn't have the current setup, where Mark writes a long weekly piece, usually on one film. This way of working suits him well. He wouldn't have liked the usual film critic's job, which involves reviewing every film. That would make him bored quickly. He would soon be complaining about the films he had to watch, a common feeling among critics worldwide.

The space he gets allows him to expand his argument or, in a slow week, to create something interesting. But what is his role in the public space? He thinks people choose films based on stars, publicity, or the director. People are also loyal to certain types of films or avoid others. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to watch one after reading a review, or for a romance fan to skip a love story because of a review. So, if a film review isn't a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark doesn't feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. He doesn't think there should be a set number of 'great' or 'bad' films each year. His job is to present an argument. He's not a judge, and he doesn't want to be."
FCE_46,"Text: Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" Teenager with a love for endurance sports WANTED: Sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. Opportunity to train with a potential Olympic champion. Must be very interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoys winter training in cold rivers), and distance cycling (likes 100km rides). Ability to do all three without resting is essential. The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently, it has attracted large crowds who are fascinated (and shocked) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km without stopping. It might be exciting for spectators, but what makes triathletes want to push their bodies so hard? And why would a 17-year-old with excellent academic results give up everything for this challenging sport? Melanie Sears hasn't yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge, and higher goals that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't place. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such determination draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will cover the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her intense training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus end? Melanie has tried other events. She has tried the triathlon ""sprint,"" for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,"Text: 'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about her collections and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults shares this hobby. It is a world full of passion, envy, enthusiasm, and delight. But if you enter this world, remember: if you do not love an object, do not collect it. Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Primitive man collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. Attracted by their shapes and colors, these pebbles were man's first attempt to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the centuries, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty. I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. At six, I went to a school in a remote part of England, a cold and windy place surrounded by hills. When my parents visited, they took me to the local museum, full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. Surprisingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. The reasons why people collect are interesting. Some think it is the only part of their lives they can control. For me, it's just something I enjoy. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with natural and artificial curiosities like coconut shell cups, carved ivory beads, and Oriental china. Another was Catherine the Great of Russia, who collected over 4,000 paintings. But you do not have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups, searching for each type with determination. I remember convincing a fellow tulip collector to give me one I wanted. I planted and watered it until it was stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I am not sure which saddened me more! I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet gives value to items traded in markets. As small objects become popular collector's items, their prices rise. Toys from the 1950s are now investments, as long as you kept the original boxes. (I not only threw away the boxes, but also the contents.)'"
FCE_3,"**My Job: Four People Talk About Their Work**

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**

I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic first and then talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I plan what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also hire engineers and electricians to ensure safety. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**

I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents are needed for learning the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are here, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there are disagreements, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. Close to the test, I challenge them by saying a road is closed, so they must find another route. This makes them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**

I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but mostly I am by the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. However, working for a charity means always needing more money, so I can't do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**

My job is varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I discuss future projects and sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"Text: 'No Title We always went to Ireland in June. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have added to the building, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't a success because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and myself. They call me Milly, though my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding nice, I guess. He and Strafe were at school together, which is why we call Strafe by his surname like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds were before they moved from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive, as she's rarely not waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of putting numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles redecoration and repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, entering the hall from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not for long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man on his own and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window, we could see some of them walking on the lawns, others taking the cliff path to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere. I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since we first came here, we'd all fallen in love with every part of its beautiful landscape.'"
FCE_67,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, called chalets, that are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl isn't a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live in the chalet. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest has finished breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go skiing herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they prefer to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. '"
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small, pale-skinned girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was about six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and big, unattractive shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by a bush of curly hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour asking to see his factory, and sometimes he would help a student by answering questions over the phone or, if they seemed very serious, by giving a short tour. Rita Cohen seemed almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how Marie's father made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove by pulling it over steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table, looking thin and flat. As a child, Marie was fascinated by them and called them the 'pancake hands'. Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand,' Seymour replied. She kept taking notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' He was pleased that she was interested in every detail. 'They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months, when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet,' she said. 'Well, you should visit a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I can arrange that for you if you want. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't much different from hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. It's said to be the oldest industry with remains found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins tanned by smoking them. I told you it was interesting once you get into it. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. Start him on gloves, and he'll talk for two days. That's typical: glove makers love the trade and everything about it. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have,' she replied. 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where she was dark, but otherwise, Rita Cohen reminded him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that filled the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned in class. How she remembered everything. Everything neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. 'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to show you the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves, and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"

She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help calm me down,' she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so closed in with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some routine paperwork - organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel arrangements. She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with a pop group's manager led to an offer to work behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he preferred being a caddy. Well, you would too if golf was your passion. There were some downsides, though. A small flat fee is offered, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were recently recognized by European Tour Productions when they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try the food in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' His talent as a cook led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing was mainly poetry. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbling - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust, like golden mountains, reaching down to the blue lake. That afternoon, with nothing else to do, all the boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to follow him. Laughing, he watched them from the roof, looking scared, but one by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes until one of the boys said, ""Let's go up on the roof again and jump down."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and started jumping off again until only Michael was left. The others were below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, licking his lips with a nervous smile, wondering why it seemed like a longer drop this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and jumping, but it didn't work. He tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. After a while, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we're going to stay here all night?"" they shouted, and when he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from nervous sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump, then got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to come home on time for dinner. If you won't come home, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, with his dark, sad face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the boys laughing at him."
FCE_44,"Text: 'Careers Advice Are you unhappy in your job but unsure how to change? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job are turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers, along with any retraining you might need. I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organisation that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. I had to remember it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the tests would give an accurate picture of me. They included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I had a long chat with an adviser. Using the test results and our conversation, he wrote a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, though I was a bit upset to learn I did poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I'm sure many sick people are glad I never became a nurse. It was comforting to hear that I made the right choice in journalism. Rethinking your career doesn't have to mean a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. 'Losing my job was the perfect chance to step back and look at my career so far. I wanted to re-examine my skills and interests,' says Donna. Some results were surprising. 'I didn't realize I had such a talent for design. But I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial commitments,' she says. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. 'I decided to use the skills I already had and move into something more suited to me than insurance. I am now working as a Public Relations officer. I might have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me see clearly what I wanted to do. I've sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.' Some people feel they wouldn't have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make life-changing decisions. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I decided to study geology and plan to start a degree course in it later this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier now and more positive.' However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I reached a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I got many new ideas, I rejected them because they required a big salary cut or a lot of retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't already know,' she says. 'You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same thing, they would have given me similar advice.'"
FCE_22,"Text: 'Fun at the Dentist's? If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you'll notice bright modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit during their check-ups. Jerome says, 'Half of the people only go to the dentist when they're in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. That's because they're scared.' To change this, he has tried to create a place where people feel comfortable. That's why I decided not to wear a white coat. I think people connect it with pain. My idea is that dental treatment should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and even enjoyable atmosphere.' This is surprising for many of us who think of dental visits as painful or at least formal and clinical. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past bad experiences.' One of his new relaxation methods is virtual-reality headsets. 'We were the first in Britain to use them, and they're very popular. The headsets are used during the first check-up, where the patient sits on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then the headset shows a special camera view, giving the patient a tour of their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit. Another important point is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today it smells like orange. Jerome explains, 'When people come in, I want them to feel with all their senses that it's not like a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people nervous if they're afraid of dentists.' I found the gentle smell in the office very nice. Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, Jerome wants to emphasize that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all. Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. 'One thing I learned there was that when you make it easier for the patient, you make it easier for yourself,' he explains. He sees his patient-focused approach as the beginning of a slow change towards less formality in the traditional British dentistry field. At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it's no surprise. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a regular dental practice.'"
FCE_39,"Text: 'Bitter water hits the big time Chocolate, which started in South America, is now a big business worldwide. At Easter, British people spend over £230 million on chocolate. Eight percent of all chocolate is bought at this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate. Large-scale chocolate production began in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language, Nahuatl. The Aztecs flavored the drink with spices for ceremonies and to welcome visitors. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe didn't spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when Fry and Sons, a company in Bristol, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate. At the turn of the century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville (ville is French for town) to add some French style. But then came Cadbury's famous Dairy Milk bar, which started as Dairymaid in 1905. Smart advertising linked it with the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside, making it a rival to the more luxurious French brands. It seems that, for now, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars each week. This has pushed manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. The latest marketing idea is the 'extended line,' where a chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink, or a dessert, to tempt chocolate lovers who are bored with regular snacks. On the production side, cacao farmers are still affected by a drop in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. Since most cacao farmers work on a very small scale, many had to close their businesses. Perhaps you could think of them as you enjoy your next chocolate bar.'"
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83, Peter Cooke has become an expert in his art. He still wants to try new things like paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on making delicate and unique objects from shells. ""Tell me if I am boring you,"" he says as he shows me his work in his apartment. Cooke is not boring; he is enthusiastic, charming, and his creations are beautiful.

He points to shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. ""I won't mind if people don't buy them because I love them,"" he says. Cooke never planned to sell his work. Five years ago, friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. The result was a show in London where 70% of the pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The pieces are expensive, around £2,000 for the ornaments, but Cooke doesn't mind if his fireplace is empty. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase.

Cooke says he doesn't set the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else makes work like his. The gallery owner told him, ""One day you'll stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won't be any more."" Cooke wishes he had started earlier so he could have created even more wonderful things. Although he still has ideas, he feels more physically limited now.

His work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. He has a ""miniature mind,"" creating boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and realistic flower baskets. Cooke has developed his own method, using materials he finds. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,"" he says, but his attention to detail and color shows it is not accidental.

Cooke searches for beautiful, tiny shells beyond his Norfolk shore, traveling to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of harming beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people crushing them faster than I can collect them; the sea also breaks them up. I would never collect shells with living creatures or dive for them, but once they are empty, why shouldn't I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty of his work."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to amazing places and appearing on magazine covers, you will probably find her studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, fine,"" I said, ""no problem."" I had been trying to convince myself that all the negative things I had read about models were not true, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to mind. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided a visit to the hairdresser's was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and refuse to answer my questions.

But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. She did not seem selfish; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mum, visibly proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was unexpected. Her older sister decided she should enter the model competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When she got the call saying she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to continue, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work.

Kira now finds it hard to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This must be hard for Kira, as she is not self-important. But she says, ""They assume that because I've become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she is needed for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even take their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from Canada's cold north to Africa's heat to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find high levels of gold; we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated.""

The father and son have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area around the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied 19th-century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to choose the best area to explore. After clearing the land and finding bits of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking earth samples, and removing old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""At the moment, this looks doubtful, although we've got quite a few people we can contact.""

As news spread about the dig, the magic of gold attracted the attention of locals and gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""It would encourage more people to come here if they are right, but if these two find gold, I hope millions of people are not going to come and hack away at the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when thousands worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University, where she teaches and researches marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. When she is not teaching, she goes on dives to study underwater volcanoes. She uses a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to dive three kilometers down into the ocean. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can easily touch the two pilots. They are used to these cramped conditions, where they cannot stand or move, and must wait for someone to open the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. However, no one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it might not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a 150-meter hole through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It flows out at one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel recalls being scared when she first went down with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing something no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"Text: I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more. My mind couldn't handle any more foreign timetables, currencies, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could spend a whole month traveling anywhere in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learned to sleep in a train corridor, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you have a simple approach to travel and encourages wastefulness, like burning socks that have become too smelly and getting rid of books when finished. This way of thinking is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be thrown out along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to feel this carefree is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that lets young people travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be special. On that first trip, my friends and I didn't realize the possibilities of this train ticket, thinking it was just a cheap way to get to and from our chosen campsite in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel was too tempting, as there was always just one more country over the border, always a little further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in planning our own schedule, we left out everything except the most obvious sights. This was a chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I was proud that, in many places, all I saw was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and have a good time. In this, we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was just a name before. It is as if the city you arrive in never existed until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you see it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. While the train trip won't let you discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to recognize this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately."
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country to find out that your baggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the clothes you are in for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and have to wear unsuitable clothes. Although airlines rarely say how many bags they lose, it is a fact that regular travelers will eventually be separated from their luggage. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and no airline can guarantee that a passenger's checked luggage will be on the same flight, especially when the trip involves changing planes. 

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to go through the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between two flights. These times are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Normally, the system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights, causing the baggage system to fail. There is also the chance of human error or an accident where the destination label is torn off. These problems can be serious at large transfer airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport handled over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone handled two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with most moving between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient transfer airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage when changing planes is higher at certain airports. Even the United States has issues - Miami airport is known for luggage going missing when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.

You should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes, or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline for the whole trip. Allow more connecting time by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"Text: 'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, shading the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, mud browns, and the different yellows of sunlight, as gentle as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly through the scene, like a flash of light and motion. It disappears in a split second, but its image stays in your mind, its impact much larger than its size. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He can't quite explain why he is so drawn to this little bird. The kingfisher is part of legend. In Greek myth, it was a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this. Even though kingfishers look blue, their feathers have no blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich green, depending on the light. It's no surprise that some wildlife photographers are very enthusiastic about them. The colors, along with the fact that kingfishers can be watched easily from a hideout, make them a lifelong passion for some. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. But it took him four more years to get his first good picture. Meanwhile, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream rich with kingfishers. However, school limited his time with the birds, so he skipped classes and became what he calls an 'academic failure'. But his interest in the kingfisher, the only one of its family to breed in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and gradually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,' he says. 'I'm drawn to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings...' His voice trails off. He's thinking of the bird's colors that still excite him after so many years. His photographs show some of his feelings, but as Charlie knows, there's much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show.'"

A. ANNE MANSON
Anne Manson, 30, had an unexpected opportunity when she asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up replacing an absent assistant and was later invited to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I've always been comfortable in front of an orchestra."" Manson, originally from the US, works with a London-based opera company focused on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in Europe, supported by the British Arts Council, and has assisted Abbado on several projects since then.

B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after failing in two others. ""If it had happened earlier, I might have disappeared,"" he reflects. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition: ""If in three years my name is still linked to it, I'll be concerned."" Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting him back, which is crucial for his career.

C. WASFI KANI
Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods in opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" says Kani, who began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business district until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""Seeing her conduct, I realized size doesn't matter,"" she says. Kani appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the singers' personalities.""

D. ROGER VIGNOLES
""Conducting was a surprise for me, but it's fascinating,"" says Roger Vignoles, 48. It's not a completely new path, as he started as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he hadn't done before. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like."" Vignoles feels his musical experience is valuable and is open to trying new things to discover what he enjoys.

E. WAYNE MARSHALL
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, then a young assistant, and recommended him to his agent. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was challenging. He even had to deal with musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. Many musicians don't seem to need much guidance from a conductor, but I'm not afraid to express what I want. If you show worry, it gets worse. I've never formally studied conducting, but people have been supportive. I'm determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you're planning to take children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try out some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns family**

Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old had a lot of fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay longer. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan family**

None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to rest. The landscaping is beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**

After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, especially the trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is great for younger children. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small for it. The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are excellent. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge family**

We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually afraid, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts calmly and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't try the Big Leap, but it looked fun for those who are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**

The park advertises 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is the most noticeable ride, and Ben found it the scariest. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but not all were welcoming. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared to tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"Text: 'Running a business in the countryside Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside. A. 'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a yearly income of over £200,000 and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were young, and I wanted a job I could do from home. I had worked with computers before I got married, so my husband suggested I start a computer-aided design business. It needed a lot of money, and things were tough at first. But I was very careful, always informing the bank manager if I was going to spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can continue working in the evening if I want. It has stayed a small business. We rarely deliver work - people from the area usually come to pick it up.' B. 'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who works from home as a designer of greeting cards. 'I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where there weren't jobs like that. So I decided to start my own business and I create a range of 50 greeting cards which I sell to museums. I work in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there is always something that needs doing - like mowing the lawn. My business grows completely by word of mouth - I don't advertise at all. People send work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't get to share ideas with others anymore, but overall there are more advantages than disadvantages.' C. 'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, whose curtain-making business has had ups and downs. 'I started my business eight years ago. At that time, this type of business was growing, and in two years my income went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to let them go because of the economic downturn, which was painful because it's not easy to find other jobs in this area. I am almost back to where I started, making the curtains at home myself, with my husband's help, and using women who work from their homes. I have to be ready to lower my prices when necessary and look for different opportunities.' D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. The first was financial, because London was so expensive, and the second was because I love the country. I enjoy being able to work when I want to. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The downside is that it requires discipline to close the office door. I publish children's books from cultures around the world, working with authors and artists. All my professional experience was in London, so I used to feel very alone at first.' E. MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a yearly income of £250,000 and employs six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes, using good quality flour and eggs. Then I started getting requests from friends and relatives, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago I rented a small building and everything is made there - we have a baker and assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don't cook at all now, as I manage the business side. My biggest problem has been the financial side of the business, which has been difficult because we didn't have a lot of money to start with.'"
FCE_1,"Text: 'Meet the Amazing Watkins Family The sons are composers and prize-winning musicians, while Dad makes the instruments. Matthew Rye reports. Families of musicians are not uncommon, but it's rare to find one that includes both musicians and an instrument maker. When South Wales schoolteachers John and Hetty Watkins needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they found it too expensive. John says, 'We looked at different dealers, and it was clear it would cost a lot. So I thought, maybe I could make one myself. I found out that the Welsh School of Instrument Making was nearby, and I attended evening classes once a week for about three years.' 'After making a few violins and violas, he tried his first cello,' Paul, now 28, adds. 'It turned out really well. He made me another one later, and I used it until a few months ago.' John has since retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling one to the famous American player Jaime Laredo was a great achievement. Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano: 'As soon as I was big enough to reach the keys, I played,' he remembers. But soon, he was drawn to the cello. 'My parents wanted me to play the violin because Dad played the viola and needed another violin for his group. I tried it for about six weeks but didn't like it. I was more interested in the cello player in Dad's group. He seemed really cool when I was six or seven. He offered to give me lessons, and that's how it all started. Later, they suggested my brother play the violin too, but he wasn't interested.' 'My parents were supportive and relaxed,' Huw says. 'I wouldn't have liked being pushed. Instead of feeling threatened by Paul's success, I saw it as something to aim for.' Now 22, he is making his own name as a pianist and composer. Meanwhile, John Watkins' cello has served his elder son well. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held, still playing his father's instrument, until last year. Now, he has a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 'Dad hasn't said anything about me moving on, but he did try both cellos and admitted my new one is quite nice! The only thing Dad's cello lacks is the power to project to the back of large concert halls, which it might gain after 50-100 years. It will get richer with age, like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.' Soon, he will be seen on television playing the Rugeri as the soloist in Elgar's Cello Concerto, part of the new series, Masterworks. 'The performance history doesn't change how I play the piece,' he says. 'I'll always do it my way.' But Paul won't be able to watch himself on TV - the same night he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival. Nor will Huw, whose String Quartet is having its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall the same evening. John and Hetty will have to be diplomatic and energetic to keep up with all their sons' musical activities in the coming weeks.'"
FCE_53,"Text: 'Looking after the countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden employed by the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it owns. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're always dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building firms.' Gareth was born and raised on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he didn't have formal training. 'I find it helpful that I still farm with my parents and can talk to farmers on the same level and understand their problems. Also, they can't fool me about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he can handle the physical demands of the job - putting up fences, planting trees, building walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth says he has learned more about nature conservation. 'When I was young,' he remembers, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and old birds' nests. And I thought recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's become clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' Gareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way. Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at a crossroads and there's just a small step needed to bring them together,' says Gareth. Conservation is one of the main parts of Gareth's work, along with public access to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects completed, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills, and so on.' Gareth is very enthusiastic about his job and, despite never being off duty, he clearly enjoys every minute of his work, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just walk into the area, demand everything, then walk out again as if it's their absolute right. Having to be nice to those people gets on my nerves!' But as Gareth says, it's all about common sense really. So if you have plenty of that, and you like the idea of an outdoor job, you might think of applying to become a warden like Gareth - but don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for many years!'"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is preparing for next month's World Championships. Her typical day includes teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. When asked if people give her strange looks, she said, ""I'm too focused on my movements to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.""

Kendra's life is now all about being her best for the Championships. She follows a strict schedule to get fit. This will be her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We'll have home support, which is special,"" she says. ""It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. A home crowd will expect us to start well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of ability."" England is ranked fourth in the world, but the Championships will be tough. ""You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance.""

In her 15 years at the top level, netball has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. ""You train to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the game, we're all friendlier."" Netball now uses a more scientific approach to fitness. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and must lead by example. I support and encourage my team.""

Kendra's netball career has been carefully planned. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How should parents handle a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know the best way to nurture their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and difficult. While most schools can support children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children need special attention that regular schools might not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. These children, especially those encouraged by parents or teachers, might benefit from attending a specialist music school.

In Britain, there are five specialist music schools. These schools are designed to create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen, helping them develop their musical skills with guidance from professional musicians. At these schools, students spend one-third to half of their day on musical activities, such as individual lessons, orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice for several hours daily in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. However, students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist schools are independent, with small classes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, living at the school full-time, which allows them to be with others who share similar goals and interests.

What are the disadvantages? One major issue is the cost; boarding fees range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. However, schools try to help parents of exceptionally gifted children with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many school directors question the idea of admitting children as young as seven into such a focused environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop 'rounded and well-balanced individuals.'

There is a risk that separating musically gifted children from an early age can cause stress. Musical talent might fade during teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to a sense of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and offer support if needed. While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic program, which is secondary to music activities. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until the child is old enough to decide about specialist education. Children who are also academically gifted might thrive in a less specialized environment, such as a school with an excellent music department or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with skilled teachers and opportunities for orchestral and chamber music experience. However, this option may not be practical for families living far from major cities like London."
FCE_25,"Text: 'An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden, full of her favorite flowers like tulips and poppies, provides many of her painting subjects. Some plants grow wildly and spread seeds everywhere. The garden has a beautiful mix of colors and shapes, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan liked and also a gardener named Danny. 'It was really his garden,' she says. 'We got along well. At first, he didn't agree with some of my ideas, but when I explained I wanted to paint them, he understood.' Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't set everything up at once,' she says. 'I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then add another one. Sometimes it takes years to finish a painting.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She is also fascinated by how flowers change as they decay. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day. 'At first, they seem boring, but they change with twists and turns.' Susan has always loved plants. 'I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers,' she says. 'I didn't like garden flowers then; they looked fake to me. I was amazed by how wildflowers grew in difficult places like rocks or cliffs.' Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like an aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm. With two upcoming exhibitions and many flowers to paint, she finds it hard to work in the garden. She hired another gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, 'you have to get your hands dirty.'"
FCE_34,"Text: 'Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isère, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are typical of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m. to walk about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing the guests' breakfast. 'They get everything - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' When the last guest has finished breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go skiing herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are happy to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning quickly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shopping on Saturday, Sarah does it now. At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.'"

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. 'Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I'd usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I'm interested in how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.'

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. 'I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.'

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went with the TV gardening show Ground Force. 'I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, I don't see daylight because of my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening didn't include hard work or careful planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my job.'

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. 'I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I would faint, but I was surprised that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is a waste of time compared to nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.'

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. 'I changed into the uniform, and I felt different—people looked up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.'

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. 'I was worried about this swap because I don't exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch to see some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this. However, it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier.'"

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past amazing sea views. No matter the weather or time of year, it is always beautiful. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The travelers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have enjoyed many rail journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert in northern Sudan. Growing up in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn't traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its great glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I've worn the color ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor. It was the perfect way to relax after the wedding preparations.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so we took the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still on their way. When the train appeared, hundreds of people climbed into and onto the carriages - some even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite impressions of trains when they are young, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film featuring a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, disused line maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we rode the train whenever we could, and when I went back last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Trying to get published? If you are wondering where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has the advice you need. Readers of this magazine often ask, 'I have written this story/book. Can you tell me who to send it to?' The first thing they need to know is that they should research their markets and learn about publishers while improving their writing skills. Turning words into something that sells requires a lot of knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to understand the markets you are targeting. The best way to do this is by reading everything relevant you can find. Use your local library and visit local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will guide you on what kinds of writing publishers are accepting at any given time. This knowledge must be updated regularly as new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles come and go all the time. Publishers are always looking for new writers; as writers, we must give them what they want. At first, you may not be sure what you want to write. Let's say you want to write short love stories. The first thing you must do is find out which magazines publish love stories, a limited market these days, and get as many recent copies as you can. Then, learn about the kind of stories they are buying and who the readers are. These readers expect different things from their magazine, and the editor focuses on meeting their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - am I wasting my time? Do I stand a chance?' As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is ready to be published; so I try to give an honest opinion, but always positively. The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually before they are ready for the market. If you have only written one story or article, it is not likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about 'success', you usually find that the person has been in publishing or journalism for years before their current success. When you finally send off some of your work for the first time, start working on more while you wait for a reply; write ten more stories, even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and confidence will grow. Don't throw any of them away—improve them instead. Also, I advise not showing your work to anyone else, especially in the early stages. Remember that every successful writer has had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See if there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing—every day if possible.'"
FCE_4,"Text: 'No Title On the last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station didn't feel as airy and clean as usual. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question, then approached a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I might like to talk to her. The man asked, 'Are you travelling to Philadelphia?' 'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' he asked an old lady, 'are you travelling to Philadelphia?' When she said, 'Wilmington,' he just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I stood up and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't. I probably looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then moved to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She lowered her book. She was around thirty-five, older than me. A school-teacher type. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Why, yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favour?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my wrist, pretending to check the time. (I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could tell she was cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples pulling their wheeled bags like pets on leashes. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; didn't know what to do.' The woman clucked sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet, waiting to see where this was going. 'I told her to stay put. Stay in the station, I said, and I would get someone here to bring her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so urgent? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a poor excuse, in my opinion. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have made more sense, but a padded envelope the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Watch yourself, lady, I thought.'"
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

The restaurant owner, John Moore, writes about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef.

I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory and me feeling upset because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife focused on taking care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant back then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This has been very good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.

Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into our corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined. He would wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very academic, but he was excellent in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He would make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he had talent. So when he told me, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for school,' I sent him to a friend who has a restaurant.

Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can achieve. He understood when I told him: 'Gary, if you want to succeed in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.'

Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He had prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping others. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he was given and took it with both hands. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even ten percent of what you've told them, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"Finding a good flat in Dublin at an affordable price was very difficult, like finding gold during a gold rush. The best way was through personal contacts: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no personal contacts, no one to tell you about a vacant bedsit. So, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going. Everyone at her school assumed she would leave. Who would stay in a small, remote town? That's all she heard for years. They all wanted to escape, see life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family would help them settle. But none from Jo's year were going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel, run by nuns, where she would be safe. Her father hoped they kept it warm, as hostels were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were still thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too expensive! There wasn't a queue because it was more 'Third Girl Wanted' than 'Flat to Let'. The 'own television' part made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. A red-brick terraced house with a basement. But the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, clearly a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and continued climbing. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, ""Is this all there is? Oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with surprise. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but hadn't talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called.' Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said 'Nessa', one said 'Pauline', and the other said 'Other'. 'We'll put your name on it if you stay,' she said kindly."
FCE_43,"Text: 'Behind the Dolphin's Smile People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in marinas, films, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on their decline. Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, understand human emotions, and make us dream of freedom in the wild seas. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest have made us love them even more. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think such popular animals are protected by law and live in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could become a major wildlife disaster. There are forty different kinds of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two usually live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups. We know little about them. The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenoses are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only found in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress. Dolphins' complex habits make it hard to know why their numbers are falling. Overfishing, which reduces fish stocks and threatens local fishing industries, also threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing methods use huge nets that float or are pulled quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show they were caught in these nets. Waste and other substances in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them, and they accumulate in their bodies. Female dolphins then produce milk rich in pesticides, passing the poison to their young. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise pollution from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This may disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet understand.'"
FCE_51,"Text: 'GETTING FIT Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might think this is just another article about fitness, but there are good reasons why exercise is talked about so much. Exercise is very beneficial for you. It improves muscle tone and changes your body shape quickly. It increases muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. Good posture prevents muscle imbalances that can cause injuries. Exercise also improves specific areas like thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. You might have heard these reasons many times and feel bored, but here's something interesting: exercise can help reduce depression and tiredness, and it helps you sleep better. It also controls stress and can help with some medical conditions. By now, you should see that exercise is good for you. If not, just think about it logically. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or weight training. But remember, training too hard or with too much weight can cause injuries, so start slowly and carefully. If you're unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you. Good posture is important for improving your body shape. A stiff or sagging body doesn't look good, lacks energy, and can have minor health issues. If you tend to slouch, imagine a helium balloon pulling the top of your head up. This helps lift your chest for better breathing and makes your body look slimmer. When your chest is balanced, you can see your ankles when standing. Stretching your muscles improves flexibility and movement, helps maintain good posture, and prevents injuries. Stretching four or five times a week will make your body more flexible and fit. So, stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a good warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period.'"

Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost nonstop rain, causing many unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive tool so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. His partnership with the talented producer has created some of TV's best wildlife films, like their amazing and popular film on leopards. Even while this film about one of Africa's shyest cats was being shown, they were already back in the wild, this time following another shy animal, the jackal. But this is common in television partnerships. Traveling filmmakers have been going around the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman about their partnership while he was briefly meeting other people at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we tend to get over them quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and he says they get along well because they both see the animals in a similar way. 'When we are moving, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we have a more fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.' The rest of their daily diet is pre-packed meals heated and served by whoever is available. 'It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so food can cause some panic,' says Newman. It can be a tough life, but being alone in such remote areas allows them to get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman remembers filming a family of lions where one lioness would regularly go off on her own. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions and even their car. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later they went to film Arctic foxes as a team. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they have to submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I developed a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because we shared the same ideas and vision. We always aim to create a film that is rich in atmosphere, brings to life the true spirit of the place and animals, and touches people's hearts. I believe if you can evoke an emotional response from people, that is better than appealing only to their minds.'"
FCE_14,"Text: 'The Netball Captain In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. I'm on a strict schedule to get fit for them. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries taking part. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start well.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready.' In the fifteen years she has been playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.' Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'It's essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, I think it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.' 'From the start, my netball career has been carefully planned,' she says. So I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player. She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way.'"
FCE_63,"Text: 'In Hot Water Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she goes into a steel vehicle, about the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can touch the two pilots. We can't stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering rock and water samples, and then three hours to return to the surface.' 'If anything happens and we need to get to the top quickly, we can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that goes rapidly to the surface. No-one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.' 'I didn't know how I would react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He talked me through the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react in such a small place.' Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research into the ""black smokers"". This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.' 'The only time I've been frightened was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 'It's such an adventure diving to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I had studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, body movement, how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice, and our actual words.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she recalls. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. One of her friends, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should aim to come across in the best possible way."" Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""

Movement and gestures also influence an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will trust the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.""

Finally, what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to learn about the company before you go for an interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

**The Farmer**

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in business, the City became less exciting and more of a grind. I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was made redundant unexpectedly. The pay-off wasn't great, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with a top restaurant. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I'm glad I'm not in an office anymore, but I still work 80- to 90-hour weeks and sell a product.""

**The Painter**

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it more exciting than my job. Taking redundancy to become an artist seemed logical. A career counsellor helped me, and I was the first to tell him, 'I don't want to go back to my old job.' Most people in their mid-forties need to work for money, but our children were independent. We moved to the north of England, leaving friends behind, but our friendships have survived, and many visit us.""

**The Hatmaker**

Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I didn't want to become a senior partner, so I left. People said I'd get bored, but I haven't. The secret is having deadlines. In fashion, there's always something to do, so I keep a strict schedule. I'm happier and less stressed now. I miss social interaction with colleagues, but I love being responsible for my product. If I do a bad job, it's my fault. You care more when your name is on the promotional material.""

**The Masseur**

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I started in financial markets at 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but didn't find the work rewarding. I almost got made redundant in 1989, but I resigned and traveled for a year to figure out what I wanted. I was interested in health, so I visited top gymnasiums and talked to owners. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I feel in control and have peace of mind now."""
FCE_6,"Text: 'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. At 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose athletics. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped for sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun there with great facilities and nightlife. But I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics - that would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you can't party late. I don't mind that much, but I love sleeping in, which I often have to skip. It's worth it because without dedication, I wouldn't have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I celebrate with a big night out, and if there's prize money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a TV show about surfing. I guess I'm a bit famous now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and celebrate wins in style. Some say we act childishly, but we don't seek media attention. Reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come home and hang out with friends who aren't in sailing. You can't focus on the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've only been recognized in public a few times. I wouldn't want to be a celebrity. I get nice letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them. It takes time, but it's worth it. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to feel the crowd's support when I walk on court. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I'm out shopping. But it has downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like the attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me much. I'm happy to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport.'"
FCE_33,"Text: 'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very difficult, says one mother: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this, and if I give in, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.' Research shows that children ask for something every two minutes during a shopping trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and arguments about sugar being bad for teeth don't work well against attractive ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, 'Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food, because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with advertisers and having to disappoint their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, 'The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, ""Ask your mum to buy this,"" that's still the effect they want.' A big stress for parents shopping with children is deciding which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot about food with her children, but still feels unhappy about handling their shopping requests: 'My son watches ads but is critical of them. We talk about products and look at labels. I've talked so much that he thinks all ads are rubbish. We have less conflict now because the children don't ask for things I won't buy.' Parents also admit they are inconsistent in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, 'We refuse to buy him sweets because they're bad for him, while we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on my mood. If I'm feeling good, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.' Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas. Although parents might spend less without their children, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers.'"
FCE_20,"**Five-star luxury meets modern technology**

The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took nearly two years to convert four large 18th-century houses into this hotel. This allowed the hotel to install the latest technology for both staff and guests. General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to remember guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000, helps treat returning guests in a special way. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. 

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can adjust the temperature within a small range, and the front desk can make larger adjustments. Business travelers, who make up about 65% of the hotel's guests, will appreciate the technology in the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by installing extra cables and renting TVs, so they can be easily updated.

Despite all this technology, the hotel rooms are designed to be comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large, well-furnished bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food must be excellent, and Chef Patrick Guilbaud, whose Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move benefits both him and the hotel, as he has a modern kitchen and better parking facilities, while the hotel offers a popular dining option without financial risk. With advanced technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion is set to succeed."

I need to be doing something challenging. When I'm learning something new, I feel a lot of energy. Anything with rhythm gives me energy, too - right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive, and energizing. I think you can feel tired if you're bored or feel life has no purpose. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' B. Linda Kelsey Magazine editor: 'I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all - I love being at work, it's not a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel down even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep, so when I get it, I feel great. When I only get six hours of sleep a night, I feel a bit off. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to find the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and try to do a workout at home. But if I've exercised, my mood improves a lot. I feel low in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, so it's probably good to eat something then.' C. Annie Nightingale Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives and seize the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You have to achieve things and set goals. I enjoy what I do, and the last two years have been very exciting. In my job, there are lots of lively young people, and you can't help but be affected by that. I love rushing around for work, having a busy life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photos, but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them developed and can't wait to see them. I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and helps my mind relax when I'm traveling a lot.' D. Floella Benjamin Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family, and I think being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids; they give so much and have a natural resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill when they smile back. It's much better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' E. Deborah Moggach Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything is making a garden out of wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I broke up all the concrete and added lots of soil. It was better than any workout or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing someone wants to read what I'm writing - I find it hard to write without an audience. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm caught, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' F. Katherine Monblot Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be on various committees and resented the demands they made on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so direct it into the things that are most important to you.'"
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. In Scandinavia, the upper classes considered skating an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was elegant and reserved. However, at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are very important, and speed comes with practice. Your body position affects your balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to center your body weight; this means leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is crucial in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It's quite simple, isn't it? As you practice, you can gradually make longer movements.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for skaters. Even professionals fall. To avoid injury, try to stay relaxed when falling. This reduces the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance to help you learn basic figures, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch good or professional skaters, you will see how relaxed they are and how smoothly they move. To achieve this, you should regularly do exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should include those for the legs, back, and shoulders, focusing on the ankles and knees. After a long or intense session, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating improves balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits heart and lung health and strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it offers a great program for overall health and fitness."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can be very emotional. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder, 15**, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard now. I don't have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gym and school. I try to take training one day at a time. When I'm very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great potential from a young age. Some parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform at Annika's level, you have to want it yourself. People say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was shy and hid behind me, but now she's met people worldwide and gained confidence.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined. I'm glad they are happy when I win, but I do it for myself. My goal this year is to join the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win an Olympic gold medal.""

D. **Sarah's mother** says, ""Sarah's passion for horses started at age 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, you have to jump all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is unbeatable.""

E. **Jane McShane, 10**, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When playing, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around. I'm not worried about being arrogant; I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like embarrassment.""

F. **Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game at 5. My father suggested it. He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to quit, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to discourage her because she's exceptional. If she has this gift, let her reach her potential."""

'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point because Chris, at fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows by another centimetre. Every year, more truly tall people are born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. Instead, we are returning to our ancient size. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, with dramatic results. 'We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived 40,000 years ago.' For most of history, our ancestors got food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they based their diet on 85 different wild plants. Then about 9,000 years ago, farming was invented, with serious consequences. Most green areas have been taken over by farmers, so just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has badly affected human health and size. Over the centuries, we have lived on soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing, was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. However, farming spread because it could support ten times more people than hunting and gathering. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished has only recently been addressed, even by wealthy nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets now reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without problems. Heights have risen, but the world has not changed much. A standard bed-length has stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk, while clothes manufacturers constantly revise their products. The question is: where will it end? We cannot grow forever. We must have some upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add a note of caution. Individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, but as a species, we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies keep heat better.) Since the climate warmed, we have become slightly thinner and smaller, even when well-fed. As the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even more. In other words, human growth could be offset by global warming.'"
FCE_57,"Text: 'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV life, but they are still a mystery to many of us. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Among all live entertainment audiences, studio audiences are often seen as the least important. Some people in TV even look down on them, like one cameraman who said they are treated 'like cattle'. I thought studio audiences were just people wanting a moment of fame. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. TV tries to get different people for different shows. Those of us who like watching TV at home can't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch what you can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela: 'Why did she come?' It was a chance to be on TV.' Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Few of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit there, crowded with strangers, while someone shows cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager says, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' But is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte liked feeling part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' What I missed was seeing live actors - from my seat, I only saw the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio monitor. Going to a studio might be a bad way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most of the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment.'"

**Bruce**  
I prefer places where people have left their mark. When I travel, I like visiting charming villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape school. I enjoyed exploring the hilltops, valleys, and old villages. Being from Scotland, the landscape felt familiar but different. I still visit today. I used to write about my adventures in a diary, which was my first try at travel writing, a field I later became known for.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway from Hythe to Dungeness, run by enthusiasts. I always travel first class because it’s not much more expensive. The scenery isn’t spectacular. The train crosses Romney Marsh with its sheep and follows a canal. But I always look forward to when the train goes through back gardens. For a moment, we can see people in their daily lives, making tea or doing chores. I see myself through their eyes, a woman on a tiny train, looking into their homes. I like the ordinary landscape. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer to find something new.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coast. The beaches are hard to reach and rocky, so there are few people. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea's beauty. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks you can combine with trips inland through valleys full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are few residents and visitors. It’s a hidden, empty, and remote area, and I love the feeling of space. I found it by chance as a student and have visited every year since, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It hasn’t changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It makes me sad that he’s growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka but went to school in Devon at twelve. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you’d never return. That place was Glenthorne. It’s the house of my dreams. It’s a magical, secluded, romantic place. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"Text: 'HAPPY HUNTING GROUND We are 'animal people' who love being around all kinds of animals. One afternoon, a series of events led to a lot of confusion. My daughter called me at work to say she had found a wonderful pine snake. 'Can we keep him?' she asked. I said 'Yes, but only for one night.' We had a special tank ready for such temporary guests, and one night was enough to admire them and check our natural history book. I was late getting home. I quickly put a pot on to boil when I heard screams from my sons' bedroom: 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' I rushed in. The problem was Domino the cat and Bianca, the white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day gift. (Some mothers get perfume.) Domino, with the mouse's feet sticking out of his mouth, ran around the bedroom, which was full of furniture and children. He was looking for a way to enjoy his catch, avoiding the waving arms. I jumped into the chaos and tripped over something or someone, landing on the floor. As I thought about stopping Domino, I noticed the snake. It was escaping, sliding off the table and onto the floor. I crouched as the snake moved with its strong body. The room was a mess of cat, mouse, kids, and a barking dog. The pot boiled over in the kitchen, so I turned off the gas and returned to the chaos. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and pulled the small, wet, but unharmed mouse from his mouth. Interestingly, the same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times but eventually died of old age. Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I looked at the snake for a weak spot. It didn't have any. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth without a flute. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, but its eyes were still watchful. I carefully slid my hands under the snake and stood up, walking to the end of the garden. I pointed it towards a tree, hoping it would live happily there. When I let go of its head, expecting it to attack, it instead slid over my shoulders like a shawl, getting comfortable. We stood there in the evening light, four children, me, and the snake. My eldest, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific comment: 'You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.' I had the children gently encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did. Without looking back, the snake climbed the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, three-year-old Clay summed it up for all of us: 'Boy, that was one big snake!'"
FCE_59,"Text: 'Drop me a line! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. Yet, for me, receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from, and the enjoyment of reading it. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Sometimes my father would write, and it was always a joy to receive his long, funny letters. Most of the letters from home were about everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls, but it is the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away, and I could only stay in touch by writing. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's even better when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo, and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn't replied, we would be poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. I am pleased that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to let letter writing become another 'lost art'. '"
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art in the Alps**

In the French Alps, at Mont Bego, there are tens of thousands of ancient rock carvings. These carvings, which are about 4,000 years old, include images of cows with horns, fields, and gods and goddesses. Scientists are worried that these 36,000 drawings are being damaged quickly and might not last for future generations. The site, once a place for prayer, is now popular with tourists. Unfortunately, some visitors are damaging the carvings with graffiti. 

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says that people mistakenly believe the drawings will last forever. He has seen tourists walking on the carvings, which wears them down. Some even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. When visitors can't take clear photos, they rub the drawings to make them more visible, which causes further damage. Others scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.

Experts disagree on how to protect the site. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, suggests closing the mountain to the public, except for guided tours. He believes this is the only way to save the site and allow research to continue. However, Jean Clottes thinks this is too extreme and would upset local people. He believes they should do everything possible to preserve the site, as it is a historic monument.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He thinks the best solution is to allow people to visit but admits it's hard to stop them from causing damage. He suggests charging an entrance fee to pay for more guards, as there is no government funding available.

Annie Echassoux, a researcher, is worried that easier access to the mountain will lead to more damage. She believes the area should be roped off and guided tours provided. She insists that money must be found to protect the site, as it is a historic area. If no action is taken, future generations might lose these important drawings."
FCE_32,"Text: 'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very difficult, says one mother: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this, and if I give in, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.' Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a shopping trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and arguments about health don't seem strong compared to the attractive ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, 'Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, though these ideas aren't always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about this because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with advertisers and having to disappoint their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, 'The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, ""Ask your mum to buy this,"" that's still what they want to happen.' A big stress for parents shopping with children is deciding which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads, and now they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses. Mike, a father of two, says, 'We say no to sweets because they're unhealthy, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy treats, and it's normal for children to want them too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on my mood. If I'm feeling good, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.' Supermarkets could help reduce parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or offering play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children aren't with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers.'"
FCE_65,"**Going up the wall**

In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, you can have a challenging climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. The crowd is silent. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is more famous for the TV show Gladiators, but both the show and the climbing championships have one thing in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new and fast-developing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing angles. In winter, they either braved the cold, went walking, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for top climbers to stay fit. With cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick edges or stone buildings to train. This kept their fingers strong and helped them avoid boredom.

Soon, many sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges. These early walls were inspired by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He set natural rock in concrete blocks for walls. Many such walls were built in sports halls during the 1970s, but they had design problems. They could only be vertical, unlike natural cliffs with overhangs and angled rocks. Once built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the same holds.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a material shaped like natural cliff features. These could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French manufacturers also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be set up anywhere. This system of changeable holds gave climbers endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it's 'risky' very quickly. Acting is indeed a risky career because there are more actors than there are jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, while others might react differently. Everyone will give you different advice. But choosing to be an actor is a personal decision, and only you can be responsible for achieving your dream. There are no easy paths - no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after training, you will succeed in the profession. It's all about luck and talent. However, there is a need for new faces and talent, and acting can be exciting, glamorous, and sometimes rewarding. People often ask what talent is. I think it's natural skill plus imagination, with imagination being the hardest to judge. It also involves courage and belief in what you're doing. Why do people want to act? It's hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the important thing is the moment of connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is central to all acting and motivates actors. If you ask actors how they succeeded, they might just shrug. They know some things about themselves and their techniques, but they don't take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job, and fame might not last. Disappointment is an actor's biggest enemy. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs. Suddenly, you get an audition, but even if you want the job, you might not get it. So, actors don't talk much about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of competing for roles and the possibility of rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, from the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. It's up to you because if you don't care enough, no one else will.'"

FCE_5,"**Onto a Winner**

Two brothers are turning their childhood game into a successful business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties with bushy beards, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, the family played the game every weekend and holiday, and as Dave says, they were 'having the best time ever'. When the family moved to New Mexico, they continued to play with Grandpa's pichenotte board, made from old wooden food crates. Visitors were often curious because the game was unknown in southern USA.

Three years ago, Dave noticed the old board was cracked and worn, so he decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. To see how much interest there was, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people said, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" But once they tried it, they couldn't stop playing!

When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched and found that it likely started in India with a game called 'carroms'. It was adapted into 'squails' in Britain and brought to Canada by British immigrants. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. The game, played by two to four people, requires skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' to flick across a board using one finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole earns 20 points, and there are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight small posts act as obstacles. The game usually lasts two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the bar, the Lagasses made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. The game became so popular that championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, so the brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board, made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. Norm says, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of wear.' The boards are sold for $595 each on their website.

There are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage yet, but the brothers hope their garage will soon house a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy playing the game they believe will bring them success."
FCE_41,"Text: 'WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE When you first enter the Model Village, it's hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a piece of unused land, flat and covered with wild plants. For a long time, people thought it was worthless. But with careful planning and hard work, one man, with the help of his wife, turned this land into the beautiful place you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the landscape you see now. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was also needed. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, chosen carefully to survive the salty air near the sea and the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far as Canada and New Zealand. The whole village was designed by Colin Sims, and he made over 100 models over nine years since the village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to survive all weather conditions. At first, Colin needed help from experts to understand how materials would last in changing weather, but he soon became an expert himself. You will notice that all models are made to the same scale, with great attention to detail. This was achieved through patience and unique building techniques. The Model Village is a popular attraction, known for its high-quality work and upkeep. The techniques used here have been applied in other model villages in England and are even taught in some college courses. All the model buildings show traditional British architecture and are not based on any specific place.

FCE_69,"Text: 'Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' rules. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, people in the public eye are hurt when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, few people use the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organization made to handle these issues. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where she should expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It's shocking that the PCC didn't investigate on its own. It should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star didn't make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by other newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as it would no longer be profitable to wait for celebrities to take secret photos. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', which it could, there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. Above all, the task is too big. How could the PCC realistically watch all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? Then there is the embarrassment to consider. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the extra embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. They might have a worse story they have kept from the press, and they know it might come out if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. One British comedian also suffered when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He feared that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a joke, and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.'"

We are not talking about those looking for a second temporary job while searching for a permanent one. Nor are we talking about those leaving a bad job in the first few weeks. Instead, we will focus on those of you taking a real step in your career, choosing a job that matches your goals now that you have some experience, skills, and an idea of where you want to go. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to ask yourself if you want to specialise in a certain field, move up to higher responsibility, or change to a broader field. Whatever you decide, choose your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility. If you want to travel, now is the time to do it. You can do temporary work when you return and then get your second job. Future employers will be glad to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again. Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a perfect first job because 'OK ... they were very supportive. I learned about office work and improved my word processing skills. However, there was no chance to advance. One day I quit, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.' Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years I have become more capable and my job has really grown,' she says. 'From the start, my boss wanted to develop me. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. From mainly typing and phone work, I now do most of the correspondence and budgets. I also handle various questions, from chairmen of large companies to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda involves me in all her work and gives me specific projects and events to organise.'"
FCE_17,"Text: 'Confident people: what's their secret? Confident people might seem like they were born that way, but most say it's a skill they learned. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be like that. At twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous, but I did well, and someone suggested I take a university course. I was scared on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school was a turning point in my life. B Michaela Four years ago, my father got ill, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought confident people were like that, but I learned that confidence means believing in yourself. If work is too much, I don't feel guilty about leaving tasks for the next day. When faced with something hard, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you lack confidence, so I talk to myself to overcome it. C Lisa People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. I learned to look confident because it's important in TV. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous, and we feel better when talking to someone friendly. My mother once said, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves.' I remember this. You gain confidence by facing fears. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed and felt less scared after that. D Barbara My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I've built it over time. By learning from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let it bother me. You have to like yourself, not be what others expect. My company offers training courses that boost my self-esteem. They also encourage setting achievable goals. It's better to achieve small things than aim too high and get nothing. E Kim After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak in meetings. I eventually gained the confidence to share my opinions. In politics, I was nervous speaking in public, but I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' Writing notes helped me feel secure. Everyone feels nervous speaking publicly. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.''"

'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and I have many more.' He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat next to them in the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a row of competitors holding their kite lines waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had registered for the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each had entered four different designs to be judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As it got dark, he asked me to come again the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into mountains with lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' Before starting, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who took care of a tented kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects under my thin mattress. The night was completely dark, full of sounds. A waterfall roared nearby and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a great view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, wind, then lightning hit the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the huge raindrops. I also worried about my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were very friendly. Kelantan might be best known for its kites, but I remember it more for its human kindness.'"

I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and rarely tell my husband how much I've spent - I always say it cost less! The real price always sounds shocking. C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager I only shop for essentials. I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something I'd rather be doing. D. Anita, 35, TV producer I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it.

**Easter Quiz for Children**

During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about ""Surprises."" You can get the free quiz sheets at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be guided to 14 surprising paintings and asked questions about them. The quiz is available during normal gallery hours from 25 March to 9 April.

**New Picture**

The Gallery has a new still life painting by Dutch 18th-century artist Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is in light, bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778 because the artist waited for different flowers to bloom in their seasons. Miss Violet Churchman donated it in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery recently bought works by three Spanish painters: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus. Also featured are Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain, Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.

**Lecture News**

A series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work. On 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists ""tell a story"" through their pictures.

The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora is twelve, and she's having trouble preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"

For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green the farmer would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own 'currencies' to make trading easier. These different currencies started to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.'"

Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them. She found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear label.

The Ghan train crosses Australia, from the warm northern coast through endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train - there are few stops and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, although the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train, instead of by ship, would save time and money. A transcontinental railway is rare, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the journey. Most of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners, eager to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now and few people do. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't very interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia.'"
PET_31,"Title: Climbing to the Top of Britain

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is far north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, and my first big winter climb. We planned to climb the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high and is probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be so hard it feels like ice. Even though some of us were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothing. The weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path soon went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they started again. I promised myself that I would always train properly before a climb. After 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we were not so lucky because a mist came down. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as climbing up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I only really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"Anna's New School

This week has been very exciting because we have just moved into our new school building! It is an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. However, this new school is one of the first in my country to be very environmentally friendly. It took months to build, so we watched it happen. It was exciting to see the builders clear the space for it, although it meant losing some nice open land. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are much bigger than those in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town for meetings and other events. There is also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and large changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep all the heat inside, and it keeps the sound in too. If we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that there is a tree on the school roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that it can be seen from miles away! We took some pictures to put on the website.

Even though we are already using the school building, some parts still need to be added. For example, we are putting on a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now!"

Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we weren't sure exactly what we would do. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally got out—covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done.'"

I got home safely, and soon after, the telephone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had my handbag and offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched.

PET_60,"Text: 'Sharks Sharks are some of the most frightening animals in the ocean. They are very good at finding food because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. Sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is helpful for researchers who need to study sharks. It allows them to learn more about these interesting animals.'"

PET_53,"Text: 'Joining the Kirov Ballet I'm Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov Ballet School in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered around and asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they started talking in English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late at night once to talk to her because I felt a little lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are very hard, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. That makes me confident I can meet the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD finishes. Now that I've settled in, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy. At the moment, we are preparing for a new production, and there's also a competition for young dancers that I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"Text: 'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there, enjoying the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people thought the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an art show in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today, it is famous worldwide. When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is complete. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the finishing date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the cost of staying at the hotel. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and plenty of wool socks. It is a good idea to wear shoes that are larger than normal to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"

The shop's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: 'The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The shop was soon full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them inside. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to get to the car park. What surprised me was that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the shop. This blocked the road completely.' One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen, but I won't wait in line again.'"

In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history by diving 120 metres deep and returning to the surface without help. She had gone deeper the year before but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, becoming the only woman to break a man's world record in any sport. A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive at different depths. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of several serious accidents, but Tanya disagrees. She believes safety and training are most important. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya's training routine stays the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training on land at the gym, and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees, choosing fast walking instead. When she starts practice dives, she usually travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, resting every other day to avoid getting tired, which could ruin her preparation. When not preparing for an event, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products and supports environmental causes by doing research or making films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools to watch sea life. Tanya says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. She believes people listen to her about environmental issues because she is well-known in some countries. Looking to the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to keep breaking her own world records.

But soon after, some directors had new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was successful.

PET_7,"Norwich, the capital of East Anglia in Britain, has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich is known for its religious diversity, with two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself independently.

Today, Norwich is quite small compared to cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second-largest city in England. It continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as weeks in the year and as many pubs as days in the year. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and success as a commercial center, Norwich offers a wide range of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's attractions is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the city center as builders worked on the project. Nearly a million tons of earth were moved to create a city center park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains next to the new development. Both areas are successful, showing that Norwich has combined the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. Back then, about twelve hot-air balloons took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected at the current site outside the city.

**What to See**

The balloon pilots stay in radio contact and light up their burners at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. To see these 'glows', you need to arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can even take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a view of the festival from above. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, your camera. If you use film, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

Margaret, who lives in London, likes to start teaching pupils at three and four years old, but she sometimes makes exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old school friends. Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about twelve pupils, and each lesson lasts an hour, once every two weeks. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents show interest in the lessons. From the earliest lessons, pupils learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says that her method is not meant to produce great violinists, and she always suggests that pupils who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"Text: 'Moonshine The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. 'Here Again' follows their previous CD, 'The Waves'. There have been some changes since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined as the new drummer. From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is moving away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later tracks are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans, but they could easily become hit singles because they are excellent. Singer Rob Letchford shows his talent by hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded the songs before he had throat problems. This issue has caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets should not worry as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob recovers.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can create great music in different styles, from the slow ones we know to the ones that make you want to dance. However, I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band.'"

He first saw it in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, it was found by land instead of by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people made their money by owning banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison.'"

Pepys writes about important news stories of the time, like disease, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about himself, even about his faults - he often slept during church or looked at the pretty girls. He describes his home life - a quarrel with his wife and how they became friends again, and his worry about her illness. Besides books, he liked music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and plenty of fun. Pepys was a busy man who had many important jobs - he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work for the British Navy.'"
PET_33,"Text: 'The History of Shoes In the past, shoes were not made to be comfortable or fashionable. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles in cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials like silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on fashion trends. It was only 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, both shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although some shoemakers still use traditional skills, most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to make many cheaper shoes for more people.'"

I wanted to help more women try running, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to give them the confidence to start. I decided to create a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with many race organisers. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but use it as an excuse not to provide separate changing rooms. I put up posters, and 40 women, both young and old, fit and unfit, joined. They were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had really considered running before. When they thought about it, they imagined difficult training. They didn't think about chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and staying fit in general. I wanted to support women's running, and I've enjoyed watching their progress - almost as much as they have.'"
PET_40,"Text: 'THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built. One of these towns was called Iditarod, meaning 'far, distant place'. In 1909, it grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. During summer, supplies could be delivered by boat, but in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making travel impossible. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog sled teams to deliver mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to cross Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' for a warm bed and food for both the drivers and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams. However, in 1925, a disease called diphtheria hit Nome. The medicine needed was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in the cold. Also, the only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine. The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams six days to complete. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who came to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the snow. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. At one point, Balto refused to go further, saving the team from icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the 1925 route. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.'"

'At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.' The story appeared in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who had supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her playing football outside the club. He immediately noticed she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I didn't know what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs really hurt.' But Jose visited her parents and convinced them she could be successful, which would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused before because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She explains, 'They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.'

Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with the idea of zoos. People who support zoos say they give us a chance to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals, which would not be possible without zoos. On the other hand, some people are against zoos because they think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also argue that in poorly managed zoos, animals live in dirty conditions and eat unsuitable food.'"

Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially since everyone was so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played on stage! We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted—only about half do. But anyone who is eager to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country—I’ve been to a couple and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage like great jazz performers before you. My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who have supported us all the way. Without them, we wouldn't get anywhere with our music!'"

However, it doesn't rain often, and when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods, turning streets into rivers. Recently, many winters have been dry, so when it rains, local people are happy. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist not because of the rain, but because of underground channels dug in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year. Dry places that get water this way are called oases. Further south from Marrakesh is Skoura. Here, small squares of land are made by water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, covered in snow in winter, provide a beautiful background.'"

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a large passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to another date if we need to change the flight day.

**Questions**

These are answers to the most common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.

**How long is the flight?**

The flight usually lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we start seeing the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have lived on research stations in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you a pilot's view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**

All passengers receive two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, passengers switch to the seat on their second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting points so everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**

We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain checks the satellite cloud pictures on the morning of the flight and chooses the route with the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**

Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them in detail. We do not land on Antarctica, mainly for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**

Yes! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun onboard photo opportunities where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join the course. Parents pay £280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.' Flora is twelve, and she's having trouble preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too interested at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food. If parents interest their children in cooking while they are young, they'll have enough skill to make food for themselves when they leave home.''"
PET_5,"Winter Driving

Winter driving is dangerous because it's hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can occur easily. Fog might appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can hide under melting snow, ready to make you lose control. A car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. 

Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car hard to control. So, when you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive in a way that you wouldn't spill it.

Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you need to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. 

Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble."
PET_41,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London planning to study law, but instead, he went to art school. There, he found traditional drawing classes difficult, but he continued painting. In his late twenties, he received money from the Italian government to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, which is visible in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. This led him to paint colors thinly, layering them from light to dark, but he says he's never sure what the results will be. He explains, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.'

Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' Unlike some artists, he never makes drawings before starting a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why his favorite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.'

Since moving to London, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters."

Ben said, 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'Okay,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are hard to move, the other members of Ben's band began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house shakes with the sound of their instruments and their teenage singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band starts practicing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must say that, although their music sounds a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"

I felt stuck and became unhappy. I envied the students at the local university because they seemed happy and hopeful, and I wanted to be part of that. Now that I'm a student, I find it hard to connect with younger classmates. They often think I'm a lecturer and ask me questions I can't answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. Still, I am grateful for the chance to study because I know a qualification is important for getting a good job, which matters a lot to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. There are also benefits like long holidays and discounts at theatres and cinemas. I sometimes worry about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age is a good decision.'"

KET_10,"Text: 'BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave a door or window open. Night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. Winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark, and they can't be seen easily. Many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch other houses in the street when people are not at home and to call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.''"

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming Before people started farming, they went to the forest to find plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were always moving to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages slowly grew bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and then some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.'"

My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check flight times on my computer and then talk with some of the air hostesses. Sometimes I go on long flights to see how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favorite part of the job, but I like office work too. Traveling can be tiring.

Many years ago, farmers spent a lot of time looking at the sky, animals, and flowers to understand the weather. Now, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones.

Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing or swimming on weekends. But for the past few months, they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because they have a lot of homework. They have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin, who had trouble with reading. Kevin learns words more easily by seeing pictures and hearing information than by reading. His brother wanted to help. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make a computer game, and now it's ready to use. It's a speaking and picture game. For example, if you look at the word 'hat', there's a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their computer game, and it will soon be on sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in buying it.'"

KET_58,"Text: 'Bollywood'

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces almost 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is more than the USA, making it the largest film industry in the world. Most Indians prefer watching films over any other leisure activity, and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of every film. Indian films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make, while a Hollywood film is never made for less than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has starred in more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years."

Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use them to help with sheep, and the police use them because they are very intelligent. A Schnauzer is a nice family dog.

You might have seen these beautiful birds with their bright colors and long tails in the forest or at the zoo. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They usually live in large groups, and because they like to eat fruit, they can sometimes be a problem for farmers. There are many different types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet, which they use for climbing and holding food. The largest parrots can live up to 80 years. They are very noisy, but they are smart birds, and it is easy to teach them to talk. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."

A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago.

This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend money on clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy?

There were so many thieves stealing money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police are quite well paid, and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.'"

Bob Marvisch has been coming here at this time of year for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish is easy,' he says. 'First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimeters long.

KET_54,"Text: 'Indre, I have a problem and I need your help. Can you come shopping with me tomorrow? My grandmother will turn 80 next month and she is having a party on Saturday. The problem is I don't have anything to wear. I have grown so much that all my trousers are too short now! I want to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots.

KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a picture of a very large man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was created, but it is believed to be very old. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.'"
KET_61,"Text: 'Gail Rollins Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to compete in the 10,000 meters - and maybe the 5,000 meters - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for finishing second in big races. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for this. Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a very long road race. She won with the fastest time of the year for any British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he injured his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it's not fun for Mike when Gail runs past him and he can't catch up. Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. But she always rests from running on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, ""Are you sure you should be eating that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.' '"
KET_52,"Text: 'Young Piano Players Ivan Petrov Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister opera songs. His mother started teaching him piano when he was six. At ten, he decided to write music and soon composed his first song. Oleg Gagarin Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him traditional Russian music. At six, he began lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano skills. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years, then returned to Russia. Josef Heptmann Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef always loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now but hopes to write his own music one day.'"
KET_28,"Text: 'Bill Prince-Smith Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he started writing children's books at 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he writes in his office. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live nearby, but they also read my stories and say if they are good or bad.' This way, Bill has learned what young children like to read. Bill writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His fifth book is his favorite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and his helpful dog. 'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are so clever, they learn very quickly.' Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film.''"
KET_35,"Text: 'POSTCARDS Today, people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are cheap, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century. It showed a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards had pictures of news events from that week, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures at that time.'"
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur because they died out about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. We don't know exactly why they disappeared. Birds are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs looked different from each other. There were more than 5000 types. Some were very small, while others were huge. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals. For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because of its long back legs.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can kill a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they cannot see well and, like most animals, they find food using their noses. There are seven kinds of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two kinds of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in Southeast Asia. But not all black bears are black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is hard for them to find food.'"
KET_38,"Text: 'CROCODILES Crocodiles live in warm parts of the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat anything they catch, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat large animals or people. There are more than ten types of crocodiles. All of them have very sharp teeth. They often lose these teeth, but new ones grow back quickly. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much bigger. Crocodiles can live for a long time. The oldest one in a zoo lived to be 66 years old.'"
KET_17,"Text: 'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon that could carry people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot over the next thirty years. In the 1950s, planes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, making the journey from London to New York only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to watch plays by William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors ate, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"

This week we are staying in Sydney, but next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is very warm, and I love swimming there. The fish are all different here: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home! See you at the end of September. Sue'"
