CPE_15,C2,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. However, it might not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Households pay for it through local taxes, but the amount they pay doesn't depend on how much rubbish they produce. This means that a family producing a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple producing very little. The cost of rubbish disposal is not zero; more rubbish means more collectors, trucks, and landfill fees. Economists suggest that if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The solution could be to charge households for the waste they produce, encouraging them to throw out less and recycle more.
Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, studied this idea and found unexpected results. They looked at several American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags. Only bags with these labels are collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, residents were charged 80 cents per bag. While this seemed sensible, the costs of running the scheme were high. The number of bags decreased by 37%, but people simply packed more rubbish into each bag, reducing the weight of rubbish by only 14%. In other Virginian cities without such a scheme, rubbish weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying.
One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, but this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling. In a broader study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not significantly. A 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts rubbish by 0.3%. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything, which is unlikely with a small fee. Other factors like income and education might be just as important. In wealthier towns, people produce more rubbish and have less time to recycle.
Should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are needed to understand these effects, and sometimes the results are not as expected."
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Success in a career is no longer enough. Many professions feel undervalued, and even successful individuals often feel bitterness. Loving your work used to be enough to be envied, but now you must consider how your job affects you personally, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because if your skills make you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination, then no status or money will make up for your shortcomings as a person.
I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment, rather than just shaping us for industrial needs, and how it can be redesigned to suit everyone, both women and men. Work should not only create wealth but also be a fulfilling lifestyle, a path to discovering hidden talents and making diverse human connections. However, this change doesn't mean eliminating unemployment. As people become more educated, they want jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. A lifetime of work should be seen as a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.
Even middle-class professions no longer have the appeal they once did. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Meanwhile, businesses and public institutions are downsizing. Efforts like decentralizing decisions, increasing skills, and performance-based rewards haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values align with their organizations.
I am investigating various occupations to see how they shape or harm those in them. I've studied how different cultures expand human potential and how courage can be developed. I've applied this to major concerns like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts work to extend the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are part-time slaves, theoretically free to escape our drudgery, but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, used by others, working not to become better people, but because we see no other choice?
Take hotel workers, for example, as 10% of the workforce is in the 'hospitality industry'. There's a lot of unused potential. Many intelligent and lively people endure low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep but a mini United Nations. People from around the world meet at hotels but usually pass each other silently. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the students they employ, instead of giving them only basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. But they are held back by accountants who say firms should focus on one core activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human, not just financial, perspective and move beyond traditional categories.
For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people want relationships based on independence rather than obedience, they should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that may seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more intimate encounter, creating respect between participants and valued as a way to understand another person, likely changing you in the process. It's more than relaxation; it's the most effective way to establish equality. Every time you have a conversation that achieves this, the world changes a little."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds by hand over a wide area. This agricultural metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest if conditions are right. It implies a central source of seeds, or resources, meant for spreading and reproduction. The question is why a new technology that could transmit words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this metaphor. Television, related to two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, was envisioned as a centralized 'mass' medium from its early days. This centralization matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. 
There were attempts to organize television differently, but they remained just that—attempts. Two notable alternatives highlight what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a potential telephone replacement. Popular science journals provided instructions for building TV transmitters and receivers, and amateurs were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. Thus, the chance for a more egalitarian form of television communication was lost, at least in Britain.
Broadcasting was tied to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. Despite amateur activities, television in the USA in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, seen as a competitor to the film industry. Public viewing was common in Britain and even more so in Germany. While grassroots, two-way television was marginalized, public reception systems operated in several countries in the 1930s. These systems could have threatened the domestic focus of television, but this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets as prices dropped. Centralized broadcasting to homes was the most suitable organization for the medium, given the division between public and private life in modernity.
As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as an entertainment center became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and broadcasting structures. Modernization led to centralization of capital and power, while breaking up traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile and isolated compared to stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments efficiently reach citizens with important information and fostered a sense of national community.
Broadcasting became the dominant form for radio and television due to these structured processes and interests. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to resources for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message is often: if you don't have this, you're not good enough. To see how much you're influenced, try not to read any ads next time you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in powerful ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**  
Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves impact our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, so cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateurs who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather updates quickly, and computers solve complex calculations faster than humans can. Meteorological terms can be confusing to non-experts. However, simple weather wisdom is still important. Human experience is crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed opera was mainly theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is the primary focus in opera, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language spoken by the performers.
In musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge, but most are impressed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a flawless orchestra is easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics match; we see athletes doing something similar to running for a bus, but at a much higher level.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully understand an actor's skill and are not as impressed by something that seems close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually amazed when an actor delivers a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, regardless of how challenging the material is.
The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it should, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it connects with the listener's imagination. However, the traditional way music is presented, with strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists, can feel hierarchical. On the other hand, when audiences applaud between movements or after a solo, it can disrupt the performance, even if it shows appreciation.
Is there a solution? Yes, much is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to make 'serious' music more accessible. I recall an event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience that involved the audience directly. 
I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. Sometimes, using unusual locations can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, with poor acoustics or cold temperatures, but theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts, but I believe music conventions can and should change.
I speak as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can on music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like plaster and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you find piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more flies around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.
**Lock and Key**
The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple beam behind the door has been replaced by electronic locks activated by a plastic card with countless combinations, but the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I can't understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that put a work in context and explained what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and deleting parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and description in a novel can be cut without losing the main point. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition helps readers remember character traits and who is speaking. In stage drama, speech often imitates real conversation, sometimes using language that seems redundant but serves to connect speakers. In some modern plays, this redundancy is extreme, making it hard to understand what is being communicated.
**Watching Movies**
Watching movies can transport you into another world, away from everyday reality, at least for the film's duration. Once the film ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. This temporary escape makes it easy to dismiss movies as mere entertainment rather than art. In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, viewed movies this way. They enjoyed being entertained but didn't see films as an art form.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings, with a confusing layout. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but many small, similar rooms used for meetings. These rooms were hard to find without help. The studio lacked a central focus, with three main entrances that were all similar, making it difficult for newcomers to navigate. However, strangers were rare, as the studio didn't encourage their presence. Employees, familiar with the layout, worked together to create films that offered audiences a temporary escape from everyday life.
**Film-makers**
Many people dream of making movies. Bookshops are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and launched his career. Rodriguez's success story is a modern example of dreams coming true quickly. In the past, filmmakers took time to mature, working behind the scenes before directing. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann found success in his forties. Today, without studio or TV support, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and resourceful."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city: rows of cramped, dull homes in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong sulphur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along the paths. Most of my early life is a blur. But I do remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, other memories appear—faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. It's no surprise my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry or how to calm her. Even as a child, going with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as on a moor. Her solitude was paired with a strict sense of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly'. This moral code was beyond my understanding: even now, I'm not sure I get it. Specifically, it meant not stepping into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting silently for long periods in the dining room, with your hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked; it meant countless rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early scenes. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said nothing except to agree with the main speaker, and Mrs. Laband—more lively than the others, whom they vaguely disapproved of. It was only later that I realized how poor this company was; they formed a sad and depressing group, with inconsequential talk about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the duty to 'behave properly', lay on my shoulders, and I felt I had to grow up quickly to free myself from it. This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at that time followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way (I remember aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat—these were strange contraptions made of cast-iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything about these early years, it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: an old man who lived next to Mrs. Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete once, at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity—a kind of junior charity, I think—only for my mother to dismiss it, saying its organizers were 'only after your money'. My mother often talked about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons—and I'm not sure her mind could make such a leap—it was as a kind of luxurious post office where rich people opened letters stuffed with five-pound notes sent by a gullible public. No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I overlook her virtues and highlight her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it had all been drained from her. To be fair, she wasn't unaware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me—in my 'good clothes'—on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, hand-in-hand, cautious but mindful of the free admission, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity, and she almost developed opinions on the subjects presented to her. I remember her stopping once in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to say, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as the only time my mother tried to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well from my childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was as familiar to me as the little rain troughs in the sidewalk, which I used to navigate on roller skates or my scooter. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to reflect a slight drop in social status: the porches were lower, and the front yards smaller. Over the years, changes had occurred: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had turned back into homes. I wondered how the residents adapted to living in spaces that once held merchandise.
**Bachelor Fads**
Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. 'In my last place, living and working spaces were combined. It was hard to relax or start work when everything was in view.' So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. 'It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area, where I can either cook for friends or make coffee for clients.' To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert used light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental furniture from his parents or bought from markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Was Bruce Chatwin's life about escaping or exploring? This question has puzzled many. Chatwin's life and work were full of secrets, subtle connections, and sometimes lies. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed travel writing, with the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of extraordinary literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he would change or even ignore reality to make a story more interesting or to highlight a deeper truth. The book suggests that through travel, one can discover entire histories that seem to exist just to captivate future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a midsummer rainstorm, I hurried across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I watched the raindrops hit the water, creating small fountains that turned into bubbles and burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was during this intense rain in the summer of 1996 that I began to think about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, to escape the monotony of swimming laps and constantly turning back like a caged tiger. Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes reality seem more like a visual experience. Walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities because they help us reconnect with what is old and wild by getting off the beaten path and away from the official version of things. A swimming journey would allow me to explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin believed that crying had no clear evolutionary purpose, but he was likely mistaken. More recent studies suggest its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized crying's role in forming bonds between mother and child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. However, why adults cry is more complex. The sound of crying becomes less important than the visual signal it sends. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, sometimes embarrassingly, when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? While many people have an idea of what global warming is, its exact consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change weather patterns worldwide. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources for food, cities, and supporting billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are serious.
The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the past 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes future predictions uncertain. We do know that greenhouse gas levels have closely followed global temperatures for the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection.
Research shows that Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this is not a natural trend but partly due to human pollution. To predict future conditions, researchers use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use physics and chemistry to analyze climate factors like temperature and solar radiation. However, they are simplifications and have limitations, making their predictions only approximate.
Despite these challenges, most agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than ever before. GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes could impact ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, and affect resources like food, water, and human settlements. Some effects might be irreversible and unfavorable, but not all. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage.
However, many predicted effects of climate warming are negative. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin has seen less rainfall and changes in seasonal patterns. Glacial changes could affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, aiding marine transport but increasing iceberg risks.
The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With half the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences could be severe. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face significant flooding, displacing millions and creating environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, potentially disappearing entirely, which would be devastating for their people and cultures, as well as for countries that would need to accommodate displaced populations."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as fuel efficiency is important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a challenging task, and the race is on to develop systems with new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will lead to important advances for future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**Aesthetics**
Sometimes, the very existence of art can make it hard to develop theories about it. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can hinder our understanding of art.
Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that block new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on our lives. This separation builds a barrier around art, making it hard to understand its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, away from other human efforts and achievements.
Therefore, a key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Geographers and geologists show how mountains are connected to the earth, and similarly, art theorists should show how art is connected to life.
To truly understand art, we need to temporarily set aside the art objects themselves and focus on the everyday experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We must approach the theory of art indirectly. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding art requires looking at the basic experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.
Many people enjoy movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories without considering them as art. This is because traditional art is often confined to museums and galleries, while people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often still separate art from everyday life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday experiences."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
In popular imagination, lions hunting for food are seen as a marvel of teamwork: at sunset, a group of stealthy cats emerges from the shadows like trained hunters and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. Lions appear to be the perfect social animals, working together towards a common goal - their next meal. However, after many years of observing these creatures in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by the number of surviving offspring, cooperation might not always be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the inert noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions to the list. It has taken various research methods to uncover clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a milestone for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the style of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious angst, plain clothes, and loud guitars of the past; in came a lighter mix of melodic local styles. Social observation and strong emotions mixed easily with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a versatile team of songwriters. They explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, deep tracks like 'So Low', a beautiful tune about weather, and 'To the Brink', a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, an unmatched record in the era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', wise women who had influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more. He bought the last three for the full price. I realized even then that there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was a lesson I've never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I wanted to learn about, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to sort through it - the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior in the editorial department or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much influence, but they are on your side and looking for something original - the junior to make a name and find an author, the freelancer to justify continued work. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and sales potential, and also consider if you seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). They will also consider how promotable you are - an important factor when a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you worked in an advertising agency during the early 1990s, you might have faced the toughest years of your career. The recession was severe, affecting industrialized countries more than expected. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in GDP, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, over half a million job losses, and 75,000 homes repossessed. Every business was impacted, with some sectors like vehicles and construction seeing a 30% drop. Many people and companies worldwide suffered.
Advertising professionals were not unique in losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to support company profits and were closely watched by colleagues and bosses. They also had to work with shrinking budgets, being told to achieve more with less. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began focusing on producing what customers wanted, not just what was convenient for them. This shift increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their responsibilities. Marketing was often seen as a cure-all solution.
With about half of marketing budgets spent on advertising, the responsibility often fell on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economic climate, but also because clients began questioning the value of advertising. Without clear evidence of its benefits, many companies doubted the return on their investment. Advertising was under scrutiny like never before.
Clients demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession led to debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often crucial for good advertising.
Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions, and the challenge of advertising abroad. These factors, along with the economic situation, forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to increase successful advertising was high.
Help for those wanting to improve their advertising was scarce. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to share their insights. Successful companies were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which didn't help those responsible for it."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't considered a desirable job. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs are known for having tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and poorly paid. However, these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The academic work was difficult, and the social life felt closed-off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this intellectual and social pretentiousness. It offered a seriousness and integrity that I found missing in my college life. But my desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an aesthetic ideal for me. I first experienced this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I wanted to thank the chef who made it. I felt uplifted for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into a preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt like a distraction from my true passion. I educated myself by reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and cooking elaborate meals.
**Extract from a Novel**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand upright and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes, I said!"" The following week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt as if I were in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled awkwardly, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he couldn't diminish my joy. ""That's what they mean by 'free as a bird',"" I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of being a traveller is both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing icy, avalanche-prone mountains; who sail alone in small boats through huge waves; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available, and who can live for months in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It's easy to dismiss such people as oddities, which they are, and to categorize them with the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but their strange, uncomfortable world is far from our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, grateful that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like running across a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is clearly competent. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that gives sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a ""fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea."" Raban argues that since the compass came into use about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus of the steersman's attention, so he no longer needs to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the helmsman's job is simply to stay on course, he can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer offers us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from different times or places because human experiences are universal. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings expressed clearly. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. This connection is even more striking if the book is from a distant place or time. We feel grateful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our senses are most alert in a new place, similar to when we read a great book. Books help us notice things we previously ignored. Our attention is drawn to details like the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we felt.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I've restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but added little else. I've corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right initially. Hindsight could allow more improvements, but that process would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but it fell a year later. Rewriting it to predict this would be claiming foresight, not reporting the moment. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, focused on understanding the present. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening to people with no qualifications except a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers aren't blind. Even a postcard can have purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for misused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting environmental awareness and tour operators' realization that travelers wanted to minimize their impact. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour involving cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or soft adventure is labeled ecotourism. The original motives were honorable, helping people make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard definition left travelers confused in an ecotourism jungle.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost the notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck a few years ago. It helped me reconstruct that time, but wasn't as reliable as it should have been. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one hospitable house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only took notes instead of writing a full narrative. Worried about details being out of order, I added many disclaimers. But realizing these pages weren't a guidebook, I let the story unfold naturally, without unnecessary caveats."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern trend, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians emphasize that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been developed, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For instance, a man's suit, which seems to be a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Reports of publishers fighting over promising manuscripts have given a false impression of the life of an average novelist. For those of us not topping the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that remain secure even if the book isn't immediately successful. Others, like me, are literary odd-jobbers, getting by with some teaching, occasional workshops, and articles like this one. I've heard of writing opportunities at a chocolate factory, but I've never managed to get one. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs and credit cards, and often with the help of those mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues we performed at across the country started selling out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being mobbed by fans at village halls and ballrooms. On our nights off, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by followers. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Although my usual shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during leisure. Susan Hallam explores their impact on music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a rapid increase in ways to listen to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia techniques. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have declined. Access to music is likely to keep growing, as it meets many human needs. National events always include music, and for individuals, it offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is unimaginable. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind it will be, and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.
I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a major income source in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media. Besides its job importance, evidence shows playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. While these findings need more support, European data shows group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, including those with behavioral issues. Further research is looking into whether playing an instrument can develop transferable skills, like good study habits and punctuality from regular practice and concert participation. Therefore, there will likely be a demand for instrumental teaching in the short term.
What about the long term? Will there be a shift in focus, and if so, in what direction? I see two possibilities. First, the music people listen to will become more diverse, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more in composing and performing music, making composition more accessible but possibly reducing the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that. Alongside this, more people of all ages will want to participate in music-making, likely in community settings reflecting local musical traditions.
To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to adapt. Instrumental teaching must change to allow more people to learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will impact the curriculum and assessment methods, which must adapt to stay relevant for a wider audience and include more musical skills. Training musicians will be crucial. They must motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with large, diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the high quality of music education available.
Finally, we must raise the profile of music. It plays a vital role in our lives but is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession must work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors often face criticism and mockery. This is partly because they sometimes talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichés or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked about her performance. Paul Scofield, a respected actor, once wrote that an actor's work is only alive during the performance. Discussing it makes it seem theoretical and empty. Each new play is a fresh start for an actor, who learns and grows with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next role. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about theatre work.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, marked by simplicity and confidence. His command of the text and his self-control elevate him to a top-tier actor. Lester's Hamlet is a tense, watchful young man with a sharp wit and humor, making him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is subtly brilliant. Observe how his body language suggests a figure ready to come to life. Similarly, Handy's Horatio seems driven by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or an evocation? What drives these performances, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director's rehearsal process begins with ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. Actors listen quietly, absorbing the words' impact. When it's their turn, they read a line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" actors breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from external or internal sources. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach with an open mind, trusting that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's disheartening if they treat it as just another job. The theatre should create a connection between performers and the audience. Everyone should have a clear view and feel engaged with the stage. The auditorium's design is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the actors, it's flawed. Many late 19th-century theatres got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, suggesting layers of human presence. You can't cater to everyone with plays. Audiences don't always know what they want, so theatre should offer something unexpected and imaginative."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real impact was on the middle class and older generations. It set the stage for future rock stars who were inspired by its new and exciting sound. For Paul Simon and other young Americans, the main way to hear this music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was essential listening for many aspiring rock musicians. Like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music on Freed's show. This fascination led him to move from just listening to music to creating his own.
**Snow Adventure**
There was no clear path, but I thought I could manage if I was careful. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I struggled on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow beneath me collapsed, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a thin layer over a gap between rocks, which gave way under my weight. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried about what could have happened if the hole had been deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess my situation. After an hour, I had only covered half a mile. It was obvious I needed to change my plan.
**Understanding Qualitative Research**
There are many books that guide researchers on qualitative research, but they often don't explain how to analyze the data collected. Many researchers find data analysis mysterious. To address this, we asked social scientists who have done qualitative research to share their methods. The goal was to provide insight into the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a step-by-step guide. This involves making hidden processes more clear, which is not as easy as it sounds. We allowed contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. His answer was, not much. There's a trend to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning through a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program and his son. The father read the words carefully, while the son played with the pictures. ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. Television, as my son and his noodles show, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches directly. Research indicates that learning happens best in environments where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. While new technology can be useful for teaching, formal education still plays a crucial role.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Locals were not happy, seeing their Los Angeles suburb changed by these newcomers. But eventually, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. A good film might make a star, but it must make money. In less than a century, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it remains a small community with limited views, just a part of Los Angeles. For those living and working there, the main topic is films: how much they earn, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Successful people often try to live elsewhere but work in Hollywood. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show-business eventually goes.
**Photography**
Photography was created by nineteenth-century artists as a new art form. They wanted a lasting, accurate record of their surroundings and found it. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and a chemical-coated surface produced images more detailed and realistic than paintings. This caused concern among other artists, and critics argued that photography was not true art. They believed that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of creative imagination. Despite this, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of art. They used photography to interpret the world and present a vision of nature and its elements, just like artists use brushes and pencils.
**Book Illustration**
During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This included novels for older readers, although these saw fewer illustrations as print runs decreased. Children's publishing was active but often operated on low budgets, leading to some routine and mediocre work. However, the best artists always delivered high-quality work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of ordinary and exceptional work, a great resource for research or exploration. The true treasures are likely to be rediscovered, either through reissues of individual titles, new publications about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may soon see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as facsimile reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
A while back, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone where you are online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, which might not be safe. This highlighted the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers endless chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we might get lost. 
Feeling discouraged? Don't be. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. These pioneers explored the web's dangers long before social media existed. They faced job losses, made and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of fame. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teens. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In 1996, he started a daily blog, attracting readers with his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others recognized the artistic value in his work.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall realized that sharing his life online made people distrust him. He chose to end the blog, but the issue remains. Sharing online is appealing, but if you expect it to make people like you, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog's address to company executives, including those she had criticized, leading to her dismissal. This situation illustrates the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. However, our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was initially upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online oversharing, she has mastered the art of controlled self-expression. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Tiredness is often said to be a common issue today. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also become more common. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans are chronically affected by sleep problems. In Britain, some popular novels feature insomniacs or are set in sleep-research labs. There is a growing interest in sleep: its patterns, benefits, and issues. A key concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up too early to avoid traffic.""
A sleep researcher conducted an experiment offering participants the chance to sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at an average of eight-and-a-quarter hours, showing they were catching up on lost sleep.
In Europe, these ideas are tested at a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands. The lab studies various topics, like the effects of fatigue on sailors and the impact of airport noise on sleep. They recruit participants through student newspapers, paying them £5 an hour to adjust their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab's focus is physical.
In a dark room, a motorway simulator is set up. Participants arrive at 2 pm, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short or sleepless night. They drive while answering questions, facing a projected road with glaring sunlight. Many deny they will fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. Initially, the driver is alert, but soon starts blinking and nodding off. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but the car veers off the road. A coffee might help; Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even without sleep. She suggests alertness products like tablets and energy drinks, especially for shift workers.
What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they move through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually occur in the lightest sleep, and the brain paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some suggest sleep repairs tissues, restores muscles, or rests the brain's speech and creativity areas. But these might happen during relaxed wakefulness, so it's uncertain. However, scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, though the reasons are unclear.
When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a ""morning sleep."" This break was a time for reflection or even night-time activities. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily constraints. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich adopted a more efficient sleep pattern, similar to today. The industrial revolution extended work hours for most people, except some in rural areas.
Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then wake up. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In certain tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for predators make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems that people worldwide are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"'I was wearing expensive cowboy boots, standing on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I knew I wasn't a real cowboy. I had flown in from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy, but that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was carrying a dirty bag. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and left without a word. 
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore, and I can't. Now, I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I thought I could be a commentator for races, but there are already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to start a business selling classic cars, but it didn't work out. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a World Champion. Even if I had been, people would only listen for a short time. 
I don't want sympathy. I had a good career and made money. But I miss racing. I miss the thrill of driving fast cars and the excitement of the races. I miss the attention and the people who cared about what I said. Now, I have a lot of free time. The phone rarely rings, and my days are empty. 
As I looked at the Arizona sky, I noticed some birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave. I realized I had a lot to learn, just like a fake cowboy in designer boots.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the past decade, hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, residents often walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you'll likely hear a different language with almost every step. People are attracted to Vancouver for its mild climate, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and educational and job opportunities. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to the city's revival. Locals used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. While the name is less popular now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are usually not great at writing letters. Some say it's because we dislike writing without getting paid, but I don't think we're that money-driven. It's more likely that, since we're always trying to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural flow needed for letter writing. Real creative artists, who don't focus on the impact of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I believe that understanding the effect of their words is the true test of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the contrast between long words made them effective, yet it showed his greatness as a writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, the opening of a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Now, new branches open so frequently that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy branch, as long as they were at the front. One customer, who knew someone working there, said the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and the latecomers envious."
CPE_53,C2,"'Citizen Kane When the film Citizen Kane was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the film. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, it was not a commercial hit. It was television that later brought it back to public attention. Citizen Kane is perhaps the most influential film for aspiring filmmakers. This is especially surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles claimed that its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had an exceptional team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm. Dermot and Carmel Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to chat with someone, and it was the best place for it. Twice, Carmel nodded in agreement but seemed distant, as if she hadn't really heard him. 'Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?' he asked. She smiled and said, 'It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might stroll downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost sinful to just idle the day away.' Dermot smiled back. 'You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble.' 'No, that's fine,' she replied. Title Race Tea boy? No, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of envy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our vanity is so strong that it overcomes even basic greed, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as a subordinate. The titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just euphemisms.'"
CPE_55,C2,"'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photographs. Photography was more than just my job; it was a part of my life. The way light fell on a surface always sparked my imagination. A single picture could capture the essence of a time, place, or person. I was always searching for that perfect photograph, as long as I had film in my camera. Finish one roll, load another, and keep looking. That was my approach. I once came close when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, mostly luck. After that, I went freelance, which seemed like a smart move, but life outside photography took some wrong turns. The mid-nineties didn't turn out as successful as I had hoped, even after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which wasn't bad. The assignment came by chance. I had done the London shots for a picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the Vienna job, and they offered it to me. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available. Things at home weren't great, so I was happy to go. They put me up at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip. This time, in cold January, it was different. I knew it the moment I arrived and saw the city covered in snow. I was going to enjoy myself and take great pictures. The first day, I just explored, riding trams around the city. I hadn't seen Schussner's work from other seasons. This was going to be my Vienna. A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for it. I waited and observed until I was ready. The next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow had fallen overnight, making Stephansplatz white and empty. I hadn't figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its spire reached into the sky, but at ground level, it was massive. I might have to settle for a partial shot, but it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality. Even when you understand the process, the mystery remains. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn't surprise me.'"
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**
London's Hayward Gallery, known for its serious atmosphere, has been transformed into a place of wonder. This change is not due to a big-budget, heavily promoted event, but rather a unique exploration of a nearly forgotten art form from the past 60 years. The new exhibition explores the history of kinetic art, which focuses on movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an ongoing, though often overlooked, theme in fascinating creative work of this century. Curator Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying kinetic art, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are presented with minimal text, allowing visitors to enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art appeals to many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and witty comments, which make him popular in the media. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but this might be because being popular is not always seen as a good thing today. Hockney himself knows his limits and believes it's not fair to judge his work against an abstract idea of greatness. He doesn't claim to be a great artist and understands that only time will tell how his work is viewed.
**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**
Recently, I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some mediocre. What bothers me are shows that push a hidden agenda, suggesting a common attitude among artists. Sometimes this works, revealing new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. With seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. ""Window-shopping"" was a collection of individual artworks connected only by their claim to be art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a themed exhibition but complemented each other through contrast. I didn't make any grand statements about contemporary art, but perhaps there aren't any to make about an activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will spoil their experience. Some suggest that art historians, who focus on theory, ignore the pleasure of looking and the creativity of art. This idea is like thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients and cooking method detracts from enjoying the dish. Understanding an object can enhance our enjoyment of it. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be examined. Our preferences are influenced by societal values, not just personal taste. While sensuous responses to art are important, the idea that intellect undermines them is outdated, from a time when art was seen as separate from thought."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting for a fish or just relaxing, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became popular. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became one of their important skills.
**St Ives**
We walked silently, carrying our bags down the winding, cobbled lane into the town center. We struggled against the strong wind and tried to avoid the icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track train. As the grey skies darkened, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car seemed like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hardships are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't replay history. However, computer modelling lets us recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, to see how this virtual society reacts."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that signaled a leopard was near. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The plan worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking across open ground, revealing his deception.
**What Cats Catch**
In the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these figures, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals annually. However, this calculation is misleading because most cats live in towns and catch less prey than rural cats. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not devastating to Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are essential to marshmen and are well cared for. Each morning, they leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to distant reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's fatigue, until the leader finally moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow for a while. Eventually, they swim away, appearing exhausted, with only their noses above water. They spend the day among reeds and bulrushes, grazing on green shoots at eye level.
**Picasso, Pablo - The Soles (1940)**
In early 1940, Picasso painted several fish still lifes while in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and soles on a pair of scales. The sea creatures appear alive despite their situation. Picasso used overlapping and interlocking transparent planes, creating a flat pattern. The thin, delicately brushed paint and cool colors give the painting an underwater feel of calm and harmony. However, this is disrupted by an impending battle between the fish and the crab. The sharp forms and the chain around one fish add a sense of menace and violence, giving the painting a symbolic edge."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography Over the past 150 years, photography has been used to capture all aspects of human life and activity. In this relatively short time, it has expanded its ability to record time and space, allowing us to see fleeting moments and visualize both large and small details. Photography has shown us images from remote parts of the world, distant areas of the solar system, and the social complexities and crises of modern life. It has become one of the most important ways to express the human condition. However, the recording of events through images has a much longer history. The earliest pictorial recordings date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. Although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of early cave paintings—whether they recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to increase animals for hunting, acted as religious icons, or simply brightened domestic life—images seem to be deeply connected to human culture. Throughout history, questions have been raised about the accuracy of visual images and their status in society. The idea that 'seeing is believing' has always given special importance to visual images. So when photography was invented in the mid-19th century, its social and cultural impact was huge. Photography was seen as a way to automatically provide a truthful visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was thought to produce a fixed image very close to what we actually see. The chemical process of fixing the image captured what was considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, photography was seen as a cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long struggled to create. Ironically, because of the camera's perceived realism, it was assumed that everyone would naturally understand photographs. This led to the question of whether photography was a 'universal language'. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. However, with the rapid increase in global communications in the late 20th century, we need to ask how well photographic images can cross cultural differences. Is photography as bound by cultural conventions as language? Is it possible that our familiarity with photographs has made us overlook the medium's ability to convey vivid impressions of 'reality'? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making the medium seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, 'this is my grandson'. Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This may be because photography has moved into 'mythic time'—its role as a 19th-century record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once immediate and close to both photographer and subject, have now become historical documents. These documents often reveal as much about the people and society that produced them as they do about their subjects. I aim to show that the camera is not just a passive recorder of events and that photography does not merely reflect culture but can inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing the role of perspective in new visual representation. Similarly, photography has contributed to the media culture of our era while also bringing the harsh realities of the world to our coffee tables."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be unpredictable, like walking through a minefield. You need spontaneity, but one wrong move can disrupt everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky. For beginners, no advice can replace reading a lot, writing often, and freeing your imagination in a productive way, without causing chaos. Some people need stability to write a poem, while others write to escape sadness. Some follow a schedule; others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid as long as they aren't just copying a set formula. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long narratives. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to clarify something. A character's memory can help move the story forward, but it shouldn't slow down the action. Dialogue is useful because it can show different perspectives quickly and keeps the reader interested. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but brevity shouldn't make it feel like a summary. Conflict and action should be as strong as in a novel, but every word must count in a short space.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing the outcome, seeing only a few moves ahead. Over time, they realize that chess is about long-term strategy, not just short-term tactics. They start to see the game as a whole, noticing patterns like openings and endgames. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin noted that humans naturally speak, but writing is not instinctive. Language exists in all societies and doesn't necessarily improve over time. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and if they lack a language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history and developed slowly. Many children struggle to learn to read and write, even today. Writing is not natural like speaking; it must be learned with effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it effectively."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to name it. I have little story to tell, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I know little about what happened to him in between. I could invent details to make the story more coherent, but I don't want to. I just want to share what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters made-up names and taken care to ensure they are not recognized. The man I write about is not famous. He may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But perhaps his chosen way of life and his unique character might influence others, and long after his death, people might realize he was remarkable. Then, it will be clear who I write about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for his biographers. I don't claim the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for what matters to me. Though I put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty, like historians, to create speeches for scenes I didn't witness. I did this to make the scenes lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. The intelligent reader will see where I've used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason for my hesitation is that the people I write about are from another culture. It's hard to truly know people, especially those from a different country. People are shaped by their birthplace, childhood games, food, schools, sports, and poets they read. These experiences make them who they are, and you can't fully understand them unless you've lived them. You can only know them if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another nation just by observing, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have in short stories, it's because you can describe characters briefly there. You give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I don't claim my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the literary world often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It's only later that patterns and rankings become clear. Today, poetry is especially complex, with many styles, debates, and ideas about the poet's role in society. Generally, there is a divide between 'literary' poets, who write for reading, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their work. However, this division isn't strict. Public poetry readings have become more common over the past twenty years. These events happen in various places, from small town halls to schools and arts festivals.
For 'pop' poets, who write for live audiences, public performances are beneficial. Their work is often simple and easy to understand in one hearing, but may seem lacking when read on the page. In contrast, poets who focus on traditional craft, aiming to pack deep meaning and rhythm into their work, may not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is not that they will mimic entertainers, but that they might choose to read only their simpler, less representative work to connect quickly with the audience.
Listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry, but it can be a fun and educational addition. Hearing poets read their work helps listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm, especially if they follow along with the text or know the poems beforehand. The main benefit of popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is that they make poetry enjoyable and accessible, rather than something only for a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but it has challenges. It's unrealistic to think someone's account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses the informant and the topic, and even if they just listen, their presence affects how the informant remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their way of understanding history, which can influence the informant. Historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. Even without the historian, the informant's memories aren't directly connected to the past. Memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by nostalgia and later life experiences. Emotions in the testimony can seem convincing but might come from later events, not the period being discussed.
**Animal Science**
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, like how nerves and muscles work together for complex behavior. The whole animal approach looks at the behavior of the entire animal and what affects it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are distinguished. Psychologists usually study learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behavior in animals, often in the wild. Although these fields are merging, physiologists claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding nerve cells doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure and must be studied at its own level. Describing a bird's nest-building by nerve cell actions is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
New social science students face a challenge: they must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research in textbooks and the methods used to obtain and organize this knowledge. These elements are closely related. We might think social sciences are common sense because we experience social life daily. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific aspect of social life, uses particular study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, allowing social scientists to go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing each discipline.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function aren't part of his definition, though he later discusses the best forms for different structures. Initially, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. Classical architecture has complex origins. There was a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These basic forms contributed to later sophisticated architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. Despite this, Chen was amused when he found out what his wife had been doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, to leave early and return by midday, so they wouldn't lose any customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a street full of empty parking spaces, preferring to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. She hoped this would ease Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked them carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked, ""No one will want that heap of tin."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He lifted Man Kee onto the railing and held him close. Man Kee, warm and increasingly responsive, put his small hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way, ensuring he got a good education and eventually owned many restaurants.
The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a trail of smoke on the horizon and then a ship appeared, shimmering in the sunlight. There was a telescope nearby, and Chen used it to look at the ship. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It will take us back home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls in the distance."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't consider how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but let go, and I fell into the well, hitting my head. 
At first, I was dazed and saw strange lights, like the stars and planets in cartoons when characters get hit. I was scared, then relieved, but also angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I was about to shout back when I heard panic in your voice, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. 
I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and Arthur. Mother was panicking, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to my hiding spot. I was terrified someone would see them. 
Father shone a flashlight into the well, and Mother was screaming. I realized my prank had gone too far and would lead to serious trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. I needed a plan. I gathered my courage, left my hiding place, and pretended to be weak and exhausted. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. 
I almost got away with it until Father asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated, and he looked at me with disbelief. I added that the tunnel had collapsed, so no one could check it. Father dismissed my story with contempt. Arthur looked at me with pity, seeing through my lie and worrying about my future. His look was as painful as Father's words, making me realize the seriousness of my actions."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan, now a widow with grown children, is leaving her family home. The moving van, labeled 'Removers of Distinction', was taking away everything that made the house special. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-storey house overlooking a small harbour. Memories of her children growing up lingered in the air like dust. 
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also there, insisting she handle the Steinway piano herself.
Fred commented that Susan didn't seem like she would cry. ""Do people cry?"" Susan asked. ""You'd be surprised,"" Fred replied. ""They help until everything's in the van, then they cry in the empty room. They're fine at the new place. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.""
Susan could understand. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their job to notice. The piano stood alone in the best room, waiting to be moved last. Sitting on the bottom stair, as all the chairs were gone, she remembered when they first moved in. The piano had been brought in first and got stuck on the stairs. It took hours to get it inside, with young Robert watching and Francesca crying, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!""
Her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to lift the piano inside. It was expensive, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. ""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were busy, and Susan found it hard to move around the house.
She worried about the piano getting stuck again. Fred reassured her, ""It's just the piano to come now."" Susan moved from the stair, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca watched from the hallway. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked. Susan was close to tears, realizing how moving things made them important. 
As the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, Fred guided it down smoothly. Once it was outside, Robert laughed first, and soon all three of them were laughing uncontrollably, relieved it was over. They walked arm in arm down the path for the last time, with Susan shedding tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?**
From the beginning, the idea of open access to the Internet was a key principle. In theory, anyone could publish or share content online. In practice, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly opened up to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to express their opinion about a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it provided free reviews for Amazon and gave potential buyers insights from other readers, not just publishers or professional critics. Other online bookstores offered similar features, but Amazon, with over 80% of the online market, attracted the most reviews and, consequently, the most issues.
This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, making it impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team of editors to ensure reviews followed guidelines. Reviews with single words, personal attacks, obscenities, spoilers, or references to other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This allowed for some mischief. For example, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. Lev Grossman, unhappy with negative reviews of his first novel, wrote several positive ones himself until he confessed in an article, leading to their removal.
Authors could also comment on their books through a special link. Most used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books, sometimes even sharing their email addresses. However, Amazon did not verify if the comments truly came from the authors, except for famous ones. A fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed after being identified as false.
The real drama came from reader reviews. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it received positive reviews from the press. However, people mentioned in the book felt betrayed and used Amazon to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but were later removed. Despite such incidents, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as beneficial for business. Reviews were meant to be a 'forum to talk about a book,' not a chat room, so popular books were closely monitored to ensure reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book, inspired humorous reviews because 'ping' is also a term used in Internet technology. One review humorously compared the book's plot to Internet architecture.
Despite some silliness, most reviews on Amazon were serious and provided a reliable indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing reactions to books one didn't care about. This makes the democratization of the review process seem like a positive development."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people have started to believe that every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often express these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation can make us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in modern art. We expect artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that break conventions. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, making it part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to create on their own and get frustrated if they try to connect with ordinary life.
**Picture This**
Let me describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book. The text discusses the variety of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any decorative touches. The question is: is the finished product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until 26th June, there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and attempts to change direction are often met with disappointment. Gallery owners prefer safe investments, and the art-buying public may find comfort in continuity. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully break this mold. Eric Rimmington is another artist challenging expectations. His new show moves away from the still lifes that made him famous to paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington has always been fascinated by railways. After drawing the railway land of London's Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, he logically turned his attention underground. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings capturing the unique atmosphere of this underground world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel suspended in memories. I spoke of the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The solace in my work lies in the ability to reorder reality in the silence of painting or writing. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering hiding the true meaning beneath. For artists, art offers a joyful compromise with the challenges of life, not to escape destiny but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the posh girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. After a long talk with my headteacher, we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had guessed what he was thinking from his unusual silence. He was usually very talkative. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you'll get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to be bold. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see in TV dramas.""
""Be that as it may,"" he continued, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""
Like many children in family trades, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right about such things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""
My mother wasn't around to help - she had died early in my childhood, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, posh schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school, and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's imagination (or was he jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his hour of need.
As he described the procedures, I saw more clearly than ever his single-mindedness, the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his dynamic energy, and perfect self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being extremely careful with money, which made it a bad decision. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money, and since her job was far away, Simon had to be the one to do it. The crowded tube ride made him resentful, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated with care and respect. His grandmother was a 'lawyer's wife' who supported legal causes and was content with her role. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries. Now, their hard-earned stability was threatened by Venetia, who had confronted Simon with anger. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a past case and of accepting shares for his fiancée. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He wished he had been prepared and could have responded better. Venetia's anger and disgust puzzled him. He wondered why she felt the need to challenge him and if her own actions were always perfect. He feared that if the accusations spread, even as rumors, his career would be ruined."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live, thinking I would find anonymity among people who didn't mind if the rented houses fell apart or if the gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside trying to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I'm watching the swifts flying between the treetops and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back rosemary and lemon balm. It's a small London garden where plants must grow tall to survive. 
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished manuscripts that I sometimes have to pretend to like as an English teacher. I have her latest one now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do you have to explain yourself so often,' she replies. Then she offers to bring a drink down. I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair while I put a cushion on the grass. 'Cheers,' she says, 'I should've gone into teaching - a writer doesn't have holidays. Still, you know what they say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And there are those who can neither write nor teach. 'So, what plans for the holidays?' 
I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot pavements with melting chewing gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness beside me on the bench. 'Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Could you feed the cats?' I ask, my heart racing. 'Of course I will,' Jaz says, knowing she would be around. 'Where will you stay? Some fancy B and B?' 'No. I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my manuscript?' Jaz asks about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning rejected manuscripts to hers. I decide to be honest. 'Let me give you a tip,' I say. 'What?' she asks, offended. 'Try writing about nice people for a change, people who try to be good: less focus on yourself, more fiction...' 'Teachers!' Jaz responds like a rebellious student. 'I keep a journal,' I say, 'where I write something good about each day.' My words sound old-fashioned. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' 
Oh, I've got a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me, then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking as she said, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage gives people and communities a real connection to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond this, there is a need to learn about our past to understand our future, both individually and nationally. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps assure our future. Just as you inherit genes, you also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of your national heritage you dislike, but it is still yours, and it is comforting to belong to something. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, affecting everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link to the past was through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities and families, causing much of that oral tradition to be lost. Now, places and architectural 'memories' provide clues to our past. It is crucial to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.
**The Fens**
I started a novel, ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England played a major role. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection, chose to write about the Fens. The short answer is that I chose them for their apparent simplicity—a flat and empty stage for my book's drama. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as richly English as any other part of England but also strangely compelling. It is remarkable that in the middle of England, there is a region that many English people find foreign, even when other unique areas of Britain have become part of the nation's cultural and literary heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, open and mysterious. My research for the novel was not extensive; I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I am interested in imagined worlds and prefer to make inspired guesses rather than seek documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays can be lively and interesting, using theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors' attention and stimulate emotional responses. Museums should do more than just display items; they should make collections accessible to the widest community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers and materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on 'artefacts and specimens'—not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CD-ROMs. Museums that embrace this distinction and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that their competitors in 'virtual history' are actually allies, creating a desire for the 'real thing' that only museums can satisfy.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that most of us are affected. This turns some people into strong preservationists and encourages others to think about the nature of towns today and their future. It can be argued that generations who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before them—anything that expresses stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not an enemy if we learn to manage it. Physical change in our towns reflects social change, such as changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will likely mention Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products related to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about his work, except that he developed theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and making strange predictions that seem to contradict everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thinking, marking the start of modern science in the twentieth century. Scientists were trying to create a new, more logical description of the universe by studying the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by re-examining the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, descriptions relied on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed framework of space and time. Einstein changed this view, suggesting that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I avoided prize-winning books because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money, chapter by chapter, to encourage us to read some educational books. He would also sneak in a few high-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, clearly marked as 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we dismissed most of his choices as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some shorter, good fiction and, on one occasion, a well-known collection of poetry.
**Language**
""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous,"" wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. This mystery has inspired many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller suggested that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. ""Meuh"" has a sad sound. Humans wandering through dangerous lands filled with fearsome animals made desperate noises, and languages have kept some echoes of these cries, like the word malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"". Because of such odd theories, many avoided the topic, seeing it as a field for eccentric ideas. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly interaction and played a key role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, contrary to philosopher John Locke's view of language as a 'great conduit' for conveying knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them relevant for only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they remain relevant only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a task done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex job. Writing a concise and fair review in six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed six to eight thousand-word piece for an international journal. A fifteen hundred-word article in a weekly magazine presents challenges of both short and long formats. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer must know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This often means that reviewers also write other types of work. The American novelist John Updike, who views criticism as ""hugging the shore,"" still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think lesser-known writers should accept the temporary nature of reviews, it's understandable if they seek some permanence and recognition, especially if they believe their best work is in reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike other cultures, there isn't a strict separation between reviewing and literary study. It's common for the same people to do both. The days when academics criticized professors for writing reviews are mostly over. Complaints from non-academics that professors are taking their opportunities are also less common, partly because there are more reviews to write now, and partly because the rewards are often small. I believe these arrangements benefit both readers, who can trust the reviewer knows the subject, and professors, as it helps them stay grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-academics. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when addressing intelligent non-academics. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary activity. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, still hallway, felt a brief moment of doubt about owning it. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came over him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, often as early as possible, curious about what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place to him, a space where he was in control. He thought he should worry about intruders or leaks, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he began to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated with its inability to change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would be blinking with messages. He was thankful that the windows hadn't been broken or the flat vandalized, though he wondered what it would look like if that happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the artificial world of the office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, a fact he often overlooked in his social plans. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but once home, he felt empty and waited in vain for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that doing work he didn't enjoy had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would often read or listen to music as the night went on, but now he questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction was unclear, and thoughts and ideas would come and go, unable to connect. There was a time, he thought, when he didn't feel this powerless, when he might have escaped if he had recognized his own worth. But he had been eager to settle into something and followed the first path that seemed right. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but wasn't surprised to find he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following their paths without imagining he could find work that would make him happy. He attended his only job interview gratefully and didn't think to evaluate the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't consider the long meetings he would now face daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through ice-cream vans, crowds of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving towards the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A section was set up as a course for the race. It wasn't like professional racecourses, but the idea was the same: spectators stood on either side of the track. Organizers were trying to keep a few special goats in order, which was difficult because goats are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I worried about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, with our torch, we could barely see the cliffs. The torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. We realized we wouldn't find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful, but it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued.
**How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions**
I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 
You are not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must believe in what you're saying. Show your belief through passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start by creating a positive atmosphere. Begin with something everyone agrees on and gradually lead to your conclusion."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will tighten. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing mental math, but some mental processes cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or become more complicated, like the fishing line. Demanding quick results can be as unproductive as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, each suited to different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted instantly to keep me safe. This fast, physical intelligence is often called our ""wits."" Then there is thought itself, which involves reasoning and problem-solving. A mechanic fixing an engine or a student working on an assignment uses this kind of intelligence, often called ""intellect."" People good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is a slower mental process, which is more relaxed and contemplative. When we are lost in thought by the sea or just waking up, we are in this mode. This slower way of thinking is just as important as faster thinking. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury but a necessity, especially when life gets demanding. Slow thinking is crucial for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems, like choosing a holiday destination. But for complex issues, like managing difficult people at work or considering a career change, slow pondering is more effective. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long understood the limits of deliberate thinking and have embraced slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have explored the mind beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun studying these slower mental processes. Cognitive science shows that the unconscious mind can handle complex tasks if given time. It can learn subtle patterns, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than conscious thought."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, anxious like I hadn't been since my first weeks at school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage my speaking skills usually give me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face, though, and when I saw him again, he would shake hands with me politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films. He focused on the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are affected by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is designed well for emotional impact, audiences from Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He aimed for pure film and the precise, calculated beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were basic, and there were few books on how to do astronomy. Now, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make almanacs and charts, and they help us analyze observations and publish results. This could be considered the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. You might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Society today has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the latest product or service, and technology speeds up these changes. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can be overwhelming and stressful, leading to a feeling of disconnect from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I dislike the rudeness and familiarity of shop assistants today, and I don't like waiters who act too friendly. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and privacy is rare in commercial places these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
The transfer of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the main role and underestimated his acting skills. Although I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, I must admit that Mr. Fearon's performance is truly remarkable. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Unforgettable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers, which become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are incredible. Don't miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the center of Antarctica, everything is still. While the edges of the continent are full of penguins, seals, and birds, the vast white plateau in the interior is lifeless. However, beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on earth, lies a huge hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms might live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers worldwide have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if successful, the next few years could be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is getting quite passionate about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the timeless quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists are curious about why we want to know all this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to consider whether what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Our connection with food is basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking might already agree with this, as they often buy cookbooks like this one. We sometimes think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes, but that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by adding some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs to water. This is much more satisfying than using a packet or a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too many preservatives and additives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will love. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is rich in symbolism and meets our deep human needs, which is why our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries, often happen around tables. No one would choose a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing. Owning an apartment building added even more paperwork. Books and journals were piled near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be punctual for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on time. She was as precise about time as she was about neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her expression showed she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**
Karen's simple wish to be different from her mother led her to create her own story, a story of strength and uniqueness. In her personal tale, there were key moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed as a reminder of past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty walked quickly across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. In a small community, it's thrilling to be the first to know something important, and her quiet life rarely had excitement. However, she was deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. His most valuable trait, she thought, was making patients feel he had plenty of time and genuinely wanted to hear their concerns. This quality made him beloved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are captivating, even for those who aren't musically inclined. At a recent concert for children, after playing various styles like classical, jazz, and blues, a young boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" For Joanna, this was amusing, and she easily fulfilled the request, proving herself to the young audience.
Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how children learn the piano. She has published an elementary piano tutor for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even with her busy schedule. She is involved in many projects, including running her own recording label, Sound Circus. Despite her commitments, she believes the first piano lessons are crucial. She feels that music should be accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent.
Her experience teaching beginners and growing up in a home where her mother taught piano has influenced her approach. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children progress quickly, but she is more interested in those who enjoy playing at their own pace, even if they eventually stop.
Joanna is concerned that some parents push their children to achieve in music rather than letting them enjoy it. She thinks children often quit because they can't meet their parents' expectations. Her books aim to make learning fun, with storylines and CDs to accompany the lessons. She encourages improvisation and exploration of the piano.
As children progress, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. Joanna, who relied on her ear as a child, understands this challenge. She believes practice is essential, though she admits she didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music. Now, she practices eight hours a day, which she considers the core of her musical life.
Joanna advises that practice should have clear goals, whether it's for twenty minutes or five hours. She suggests rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even with mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson once said, ""What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure."" This suggests that good writing is often difficult. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they have very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard work. Writing slowly helps the brain focus. When it's hard to change or erase something, you write more carefully. On the other hand, using a computer can make you careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing drafts on a computer as they did writing by hand. Similarly, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers who aren't used to the power of words might exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and character of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was plain, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he returned. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi. Lights came on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. You could make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my chair. ""Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a question he couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after lighters, we'd think they were an improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take generations. This kind of thinking is self-centered, believing our generation is at a historical turning point. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would start disappearing in the 1980s. So far, that hasn't happened. Reading long texts on a screen is so unpleasant that most people avoid it. Computers encourage people to read in bits and pieces. Some say this leads to new ways of storytelling, but there's nothing new about reading non-linearly. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, aren't read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything perfectly organized. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it since it was laid down, and the desk was the dark wood he remembered from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they'd had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, more as a statement than a question. She had been making Lancelot coffee for months, so she should know. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time, realizing that staying away would lead to chaos. He often thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis; he wanted a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the firm. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned for books. Ian's unpredictable nature made him even less reliable. Lancelot skimmed the synopsis, recognizing almost every phrase. He closed the folder, realizing Ian's manuscript might never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt uninspired. Lancelot recalled stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, coaxed out chapter by chapter. But Ian's advance had been huge, a reversal of the usual business practice where authors deliver a manuscript before being paid. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's peers had quickly taken over British theatre, but Ian's energy seemed unmatched. He wore his coat like a cape and spoke of famous writers as if he knew them personally. Yet, Ian's creative potential remained untapped. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. As a literary influencer, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he failed to produce even one issue despite using the budget for twelve. His contract with a fashion magazine resulted in stories about his high salary, which increased in hopes of making him produce more, but he produced little. At editorial meetings, Ian was critical and sarcastic. Ten years later, he was unreliable even for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,C2,"'England's breakfast revolution The importance of a good breakfast is clear according to health experts, but historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys, and to the sick having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobles. However, in the sixteenth century, breakfast gradually became common. Some writers say this was because food became more available. However, they often overlook other important social changes. For example, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important, as people started working set hours, often very early. So, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their skills, personal views, and social and cultural norms. This book will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might understand the photos on the page without thinking about them deeply. However, we can ask if the photo truly shows the scene as it was or if it reflects the photographer's perspective. Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol of a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-belief. To succeed, you need to focus entirely on your goal, putting everything else aside. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, and it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows individual excellence, but it's also a team game, so you must balance both. Like in life, you can succeed alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened doors and shown me things around the world that others may never see. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences are so vivid that they stand out in our memory. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a hidden spot in a tall tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt drawn into a new artistic world. To follow the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird's performance seemed like an incredible improvisation. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through the window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"'Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports. There's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a small brown bird hits the glass. It's a wren: a bird often seen as a sign or omen. Is it trying to send a message from a world beyond our understanding? Or is it just a bird trapped in a greenhouse? Both could be true, depending on your perspective. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens are common in British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. A forest without wrens feels empty. This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, from a time when people relied on nature for survival. They developed a language to express the importance of animals. This significance can change over time. For example, in the early 1500s, red kites were common in London and seen as helpful scavengers. Later, they were considered pests and nearly disappeared, except in Wales. Now, they are protected and seen as symbols of conservation. Our bond with birds goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds to learn about predators, weather, and food, and saw them as links to the spiritual world. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, reflecting our own identity and connection to nature. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but they remain part of us. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is a cultural loss as well as an ecological one. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize love and magic. Their decline is felt deeply by those familiar with literature and folklore. However, the loss of birds not featured in stories often goes unnoticed. Folklore is important because it connects us to birds in a way that scientific terms cannot. It evokes feelings and memories buried beneath modern life. Whether watching wildlife films or birds in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we struggle to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding the key to a mystery that keeps us curious.'"
CPE_28,C2,"'Maps The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface using distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in time units, like 'a day's journey by river', which told more about how easy it was to travel the terrain than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, written itineraries were popular alongside maps for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, may not show true directions. Early maps used signs to mark landmarks, with their size indicating importance. The conventions used in maps varied depending on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is key when studying old maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and making maps more comprehensive. Cartography has used other sciences to help, like using the magnetic compass instead of relying on shadows or stars for direction. As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, maps became more detailed. Discoveries like the earth being slightly flattened at the poles led to more precise mapping. Over time, the users of maps expanded beyond travelers and merchants to include soldiers, archaeologists, historians, and geographers, each with specific needs. Modern cartographers have developed ways to map various distributions, such as geological layers and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography. However, the development of cartography has not been continuous or consecutive. There have been times of slow progress and rapid development, with old ideas persisting alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what was needed for progress but had to wait for better technology. Since copying old maps was easy and printing was costly, publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be accepted uncritically as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them a valuable record for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so fascinating and instructive.'"
CPE_35,C2,"**Tim Rice's Introduction to Andrew Lloyd Webber**
I was invited into a young man's drawing room, a calm and cultured space amidst a chaotic house. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like upgrading from economy to business class. This room held the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and surprising items like Georgian wine glasses and furniture. The young man was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and had nine months before starting. During this time, he aimed to become England's answer to composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were equally ambitious—I wanted to be a pop star for the fame, money, and women. Unlike Andrew, my dreams weren't life or death, though they might have been if I had failed.
When Andrew suggested I try to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. Within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three of his compositions on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. He played selections from shows he had written at school, reminding me of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded. We agreed to meet again and write something together. Although I was more interested in pop charts than West End theatre, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination. I didn't want to miss the chance to work with someone who could take the musical theatre by storm.
The next day, back at my desk where I was training to become a solicitor, my certainty about a life in show business with Andrew faded. I continued to look for groups needing a vocalist and wrote simple songs that suited my voice. It seemed likely I would eventually become a lawyer, as my father predicted. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was fascinating, talking about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and supporting Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by his idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a philanthropist who founded orphanages. The story seemed too clean and unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was infectious. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar, there's room for two. We could be the second one.
I started working with enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew outlined the plot, played the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which his previous lyricist had thought up. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be ill, to write my first theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have an amazing ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy through language. Language is so integral to human life that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you find two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This suggests that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning wasn't invented by a clever spider and doesn't rely on education or a talent for building.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can greatly shape the look of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions all year support the growth of tropical jungles, which are rich in species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas can only support a few living things. Daily weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the air, being light, doesn't move as fast as the spinning Earth. However, the sun is a more significant cause of air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning more than I ever wanted to about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee wasn't as easy as it seemed, and I expected to be demoted to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get the hang of it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture seem perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on details. However, few TV series successfully capture both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a reliable critic with a captivating personality, and he had nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often overlooked by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but it instead explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, one can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which aligns well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed the market would control the price of scarce metals have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and raw material costs are decreasing. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate allegations against a multinational company benefiting from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are plenty of ferries and water-taxis, or you can rent a boat to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a reason. Its calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. On land, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle at night."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**
The Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a unique experience: a weekend course where you can build your own custom bamboo bike frame. Located in Hackney Wick, east London, this is the only bamboo bike-building course in the UK. The atmosphere is lively and fun, quite different from a typical woodwork class.
Bamboo bikes are becoming popular again, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, these bikes can be expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable and spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell frames.
The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community project than a business. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, so they run the club alongside their full-time jobs. Their courses are reasonably priced and include a computer-designed custom bike frame and a fun weekend of bike-building.
For someone like me, who isn't great at DIY, the quality of the bike was a concern. On the first day, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and form strong joints. The process involves gluing bamboo tubes together to form the bike's frame, with alloy tubes used for parts that need extra strength. The instructors are always there to help if needed.
Most participants enjoy the challenge of building their own bike, and many are engineers. But even if you make mistakes, it's easy to fix them with another piece of bamboo. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, and you can choose from different styles like plain, black, or mottled bamboo.
On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. After a final waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. The finished bike is strong and durable, comparable to metal bikes. Ian and James have tested their bikes extensively, and they hold up well.
While bamboo bikes might look a bit rough compared to professional frames, they have a unique charm. I prefer a relaxed style for leisurely rides, so I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. Bamboo bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making for a comfortable ride.
James believes the real joy comes when the bike is on the road. They are light, effortless, and fun to ride. And the best part? The cost is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she discovered a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she recalls, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on communication between the sexes is a key part of the growing self-help industry, which claims to address Americans' desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre is filling shelves with books that are as exaggerated as their covers. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar or too niche. Editors focus on marketability, asking questions like, ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Reverend admits, ""A catchy title is two-thirds of the battle. It helps you reach people.""
**Autobiographies**
There is an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may avoid sharing shameful actions or thoughts, or they might leave out details they consider unimportant. Some writers believe that inventing stories can better capture the truth about themselves than sticking strictly to facts. Others might label their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can be done without cynicism.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories have been seen as reflecting the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. They are allegories where crime represents human impulses like lust or greed, and solving the crime restores order. In Hammett's stories, society is restored but shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other, sharing traits. The private eye is both a crook and a competitor, caught between law and crime. His mission is complicated by his connection to both sides.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was promoting his new book. Gould believes that understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. In science, only those who are part of the community can effectively present it. He advises never to write down to the reader. ""Simplify the language but not the argument,"" he says. ""Once readers feel patronized, your piece is dead."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, the air feels cold. To combat this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quieter times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It symbolizes our ability to control or change the climate. However, many buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls to absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple measures could greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It's not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials. These instruments measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became garden ornaments—romantic but outdated in a modern age. Now, they are gaining attention again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm is in their connection to the planets. He describes a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show where serious, grey-haired women painted teacups with delicate flowers. Each brushstroke was perfect, forming petals or leaves. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. It seemed they had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered who would join a china-painting course. Would beginners show natural artistry? In reality, the atmosphere was relaxed. The students were there to have fun, and even the tutor didn't want to paint petals on teacups with the speed I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent mentioned that the other travelers were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Due to a mistake at the travel agency, check-in desk, or a computer error, Keith and Dawne ended up in Switzerland at the Edelweiss Hotel, Room 212.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She confirmed their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with Northern England accents. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
Upon arrival, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but Keith assumed it was part of the plan. Tired and dirty from travel, they accepted the beds offered to them. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the entire holiday and became worried.
The receptionist explained they could enjoy the lake and take a steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly told him there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help.
Mrs. Franks, the woman from the plane, approached them. Dawne asked if she was in charge and explained they were in the wrong hotel. Keith added that they followed the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl at Gatwick. Mrs. Franks explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and it was easy to follow the wrong group.
Keith insisted they weren't meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she'd check and left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened.
An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted Keith's thoughts, saying they had a great night's sleep. Dawne politely responded. Keith and Dawne left the reception area, not mentioning the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up on a tour with elderly people, which was the opposite of what they wanted. Uncle had insisted they needed a break from the demands of the elderly."

American executives are now looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. In Britain, most people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are enthusiastically catching up. Biographies and accounts of the Endurance voyage are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his adventures with admiration, drawing lessons in leadership and communication. They even refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton.' The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises,' such as when a company's plant explodes or when half the workforce must be laid off.
MacGregor explains that Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton had his values in order and was at his best when he and his team had much to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most fascinating decisions was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole during his 1908 expedition. This decision showed his credibility for future expeditions: the lives of his men were most important.
In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. While today's managers often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it on. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. Shackleton told his men they would reach safety if they continued to do their best and trusted him. From their accounts and diaries, it's clear Shackleton was always in charge. He planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions. He was adaptable and willing to start fresh when needed.
Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. MacGregor notes that in desperate situations, doing nothing can be the hardest thing, especially in America, where people are eager to act quickly. For example, if you buy bonds and guess wrong on interest rates, holding on can eventually recover your money. Similarly, don't be afraid to change plans if they're not working. If a new product fails, stop selling it.
Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, was without gloves. He insisted Hurley take his own gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he refused. Someone else recalled Shackleton doing the same with a biscuit during the 1905 expedition when they were near starving. Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says the public's appetite for heroic endeavors is growing. Shackleton stands out as a genuine embodiment of the ideals we long for today."
