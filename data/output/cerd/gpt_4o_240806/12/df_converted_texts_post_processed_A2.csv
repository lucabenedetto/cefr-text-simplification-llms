CPE_15,C2,"'Paying for Rubbish Some people think charging families for each bag of rubbish they make is good for the environment and makes sense with money. But it might not be. In many places, rubbish is collected for free. Families pay for this service with local taxes. But a family that makes a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that makes a little. More rubbish means more workers and trucks are needed, and local governments pay more for rubbish disposal. If rubbish disposal is free, people might make too much rubbish. One idea is to make families pay for each bag of rubbish. This might make them throw away less and recycle more. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea does not always work well. They studied some American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common way is to sell stickers for rubbish bags. Only bags with stickers are collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, people paid 80 cents for each bag. The number of bags went down by 37%, but people just put more rubbish in each bag. The weight of rubbish went down by only 14%. In other towns without this system, rubbish weight went down by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying. Recycling went up by 15%, but many people were already recycling. In another study, the economists found that higher prices for rubbish stickers only reduced rubbish by a small amount. A 10% increase in price reduced rubbish by only 0.3%. People would need to buy less of everything to make a big change. Other things like income and education might also affect how much rubbish people make. Richer towns make more rubbish and have less time to recycle. Charging for rubbish is not a bad idea, but it is complicated. Simple ideas can have complex results, and sometimes they do not work as expected.'"
CPE_19,C2,"'Work Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Success in a job is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special. Now, you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. This is important. If your job makes you boring or too busy to learn new things, then money and status are not enough. I want to find out how work can help us grow as people, not just be a way to make money. Work should help us discover new talents and meet different people. But this does not mean ending unemployment. People want jobs that are interesting and useful. Work should be like art, with happy people at the center. Many jobs, like doctors and accountants, are stressful. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients. Accountants worry about their job's ethics. Architects cannot always be creative. Managers are stuck in bureaucracy. Many workers do not feel connected to their companies. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company's values. I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I am looking for better ways to work. Many experts focus on making companies last longer and earn more money. But we also need to think about what makes us happy as people. How many of us feel truly alive at work? Many people feel like part-time slaves, stuck in their jobs. For example, hotel workers often have low pay and long hours. Hotels have not changed much since the past. They could be places where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel staff could do more than just simple tasks. If hotels cared more about their staff's dreams, they could offer more services. But accountants often stop this because they want to focus on making money. We need to think about work from a human angle, not just a financial one. Work is a relationship. People want to be independent and choose their jobs and colleagues. They need to talk to people from different backgrounds. Communication is important, but real conversation is more than just talking. It is about understanding and respecting each other. Every good conversation can change the world a little bit.'"
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand. It is an agricultural idea, but also a modern one. It is about planned growth and a good harvest. This idea suggests there are seeds at the center, ready to spread. The question is why a new technology that sent words and pictures was organized like this.
Television is like the telegraph and telephone, which are two-way communication tools. But, from the start, TV was seen as a one-way 'mass' medium. Sending TV to homes from a central place fit with modern society. Other ways of organizing TV were just experiments.
In the 1930s, some people in Britain tried two-way TV, like a telephone. Magazines showed how to make TV transmitters and receivers. But in 1938, big companies set TV standards that stopped these small experiments.
In the USA, TV was first for public shows and was seen as a competitor to movies. In Britain and Germany, people watched TV in public places. The idea of two-way TV was not popular, but public TV was a real option in the 1930s.
Manufacturers wanted to sell TVs for homes. As people got more money, they wanted TVs at home for entertainment. This happened in Western countries and is now global. Broadcasting helped governments share important information and create a sense of community.
Broadcasting was also seen as good for democracy, giving people access to information. But TV is changing, and the idea of broadcasting might become outdated. This metaphor might only describe a certain time in history."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you never feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can become too much. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much you are influenced, try not to read any advertising signs next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages make us want to buy things without us even knowing it. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy, buy, buy.
**Caves**
Scientists and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves. They look at how caves are formed, their water, and their life. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and we want to learn more about them. Because caves are natural, they have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they affect our lives. But, visiting caves can be hard, so not only professors study them. There is a mix of professional scientists and people who visit caves for fun who study them.
**Weather Watch**
Many people who watched the weather without any tools started the study of weather, called meteorology. Since the 17th century, it has become a very technical science. Satellites and electronic tools give us weather information quickly, and computers solve hard math problems very fast. Meteorology uses long words that are hard to understand for most people. But simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience helps turn computer data into weather forecasts. People’s observations can still give special information that helps professionals understand the weather."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
Not long ago, I thought opera was mainly theatre. But after working at an opera house, I learned that music is more important in opera. In theatre, the words and actors are most important. In music, the performers' skills are admired, like athletes in a sports match. Many people in the audience may not understand music technically, but they are impressed by the performers' hard work.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They might not see acting as a special skill because it seems like something they could do. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, but they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" Theatre audiences and performers meet on more equal terms than in music.
Music can learn from theatre about connecting with the audience. Live music is full of emotions and can be unpredictable. But music events often feel formal, with strict dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists. Sometimes, audiences clap at the wrong time, which can interrupt the performance.
Many people are working to make music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's opera ""In Search of Angels,"" where the audience moved with the performance. It was a great musical experience and changed many people's lives.
I wish music had more of the excitement and boldness of theatre. Sometimes, using unusual places for performances can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists to different places. I believe music events can change to be more exciting. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
I think sand is amazing because it can become useful things like glass and concrete. But, I don't like sand on the beach. It is a problem between the car park and the sea. Sand blows in your face, gets in your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step on a towel, get in a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off. For days, you find sand on the floor when you take off your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a long time. I don't like sand.
**Lock and Key**
People have always wanted a safe home. Long ago, they used a beam behind the door. Now, we have electronic locks with many combinations. But people still like locks and keys. They feel safe with a key. Some companies tried computer locks with smart cards, but people prefer keys at home. One company made a new electronic lock with a real metal key.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery because I don't understand modern art. I like some things, like furry art, neon lights, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more, I would have more opinions. But art is not about understanding; it's about feeling. This idea is nice, but it doesn't work for me. The new gallery helps visitors understand art. The labels explain the art and what it means. This information helped me understand the art better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
When books are made into movies, a lot of the story is cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also be interesting. When I worked on a movie script, I saw that I could remove a lot of the talking and details from the book and still keep the main idea. This doesn't mean the book's words were not needed. It's about how each type of story, book or movie, needs different things. In a book, we often see repeated details about characters or who is speaking, which helps us understand better. In plays, which are mostly talking, this repetition is also used but in a different way. Some modern plays use a lot of extra words that don't add much meaning, just to show people are talking.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the movie world. It's like escaping from real life for a while. But when the movie ends, we return to the real world. In the past, some people thought movies were just for fun and not real art. Our parents and teachers often said this. They liked movies but didn't think they were important like art.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because everything looked the same. There were three main entrances, but only one led to where you wanted to go. It was confusing for new people, but not many new people came because the studio didn't want them. The people who worked there knew their way and worked together to make movies that brought excitement and adventure to people.
**Film-makers**
Many people want to make movies. There are many books and courses on how to write scripts and make films. Some competitions give out cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his first movie, El Mariachi, which was very cheap to make but made him famous. He became successful very quickly. In the past, filmmakers took longer to become successful. They worked in different jobs in the studio before making their own movies. Now, without big studios to help, new filmmakers have to be more independent."
CPE_3,C2,"'In those days, many council houses were on the west side of the city. They were small and not very nice, made of orange bricks or white stucco. In summer, a factory two miles away made the air smell bad, like sulphur. In the morning, you could see paperboys making faces because of the smell. I don't remember much from my early life, but I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses. I also remember my mother. She was small, always seemed angry, and I didn't know why. She liked to be alone, even in a room full of people. She wanted everything to be proper. This meant not going into neighbors' gardens and sitting quietly for a long time listening to the radio. My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who liked the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn't talk much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They often talked about things like bad weather and children who didn't behave. Growing up in West Earlham was the same for everyone. Until you were five, you stayed at home. After your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school. Some kids had a mother with a bike to take them, but my mother let other kids take me. I remember summer holidays when I saw the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man who told stories about the Merchant Navy and a charity event where a woman gave out lemonade. My mother didn't like the charity because she thought they just wanted money. My mother didn't trust politicians either. She thought they were greedy. But she did care about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum. We looked at paintings, and once she made a joke about a Roman soldier in a painting, saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' It was rare for her to make a joke.'"
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air was wet and sticky. I felt like I was sneaking around. I knew this side of the street very well. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards. There was Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of the Krings and the Pottses, where my first friends, all girls, lived. I didn't know everyone by name, but each house was special to me. I remembered the little paths in the cement that took rain from the roofs to the street. I used to skate or ride my scooter over them. As the street went downhill, the houses looked a bit different. The porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones. Some houses became stores, and some stores, like Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert is a furniture designer. He lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. The flat has big brick walls and huge doors. Curtains used to come in through these doors from trains nearby. Gilbert didn't want a big open space. He wanted separate areas for living and working. He used a big plastic sheet to make a hallway and hide his office. This way, the kitchen is in the middle, where he can cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To make the flat feel warm, he used light wood for the floors. He has modern chairs and sofas, but also some old furniture from his parents or markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. People wonder why he traveled so much. His life and books were full of secrets and stories. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" came out in 1977. It was a travel book that changed how people wrote about travel. It was exciting and full of imagination. Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories better. He believed that through travel, you could find amazing stories from the past.
**Swimming**
One summer, it rained heavily as I ran across my lawn to the pool. I swam, watching the raindrops hit the water. When the storm got stronger, it was like the pool was meeting the sky. In the summer of 1996, I thought about swimming a long distance in Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea. I was tired of swimming back and forth in a pool. Many places today are marked and explained, but swimming, walking, and cycling let us explore freely. A swimming journey would let me see the mysterious parts of our world, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose for humans. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children become close. Many people think children cry because they feel helpless. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than seeing someone cry. In early human groups, crying might have helped people trust each other and feel connected. We can cry for other reasons too. We might cry when we feel sorry for someone who is treated unfairly. Sometimes, we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, especially when we are with others. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,C2,"'The Heat is On We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get and how will it change our lives? Many people know a little about global warming, but no one is sure about what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will probably change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the air is connected to everything on Earth, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are important. The problem is knowing how the world will change and what is causing these changes. In the last 100 years, human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air. These gases are related to global temperature. It seems that these gases, which will continue to increase, are already changing the global climate. But we do not fully understand how the global heat balance works, so the future is uncertain. We know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years. This shows they are probably related. Evidence suggests that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists think this is not natural and is partly because of human pollution. Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. These programs use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other climate factors. However, they are not perfect and are expensive to use. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know they are complex. Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. GCMs help us understand what the world might be like in the future. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Scientists also expect more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, in some places. These changes will affect the environment and humans. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are, the species they have, and their benefits to humans. Resources like food, water, and human settlements are sensitive to climate changes. Some effects might be permanent and bad in many areas, but not everywhere. Some climate changes might be good. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have helped increase wheat production since 1952. Warmer temperatures mean fewer frosts, which damage crops. However, many future climate changes might not be good. Small climate changes can affect water availability, causing droughts. Problems will first appear in dry areas and places with water shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall has decreased in some areas. Rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter in southern Portugal. Another problem is changes to glaciers, which will affect ice, plants, animals, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making it easier for ships and oil exploration but increasing iceberg dangers. The most visible effect of global warming might be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and ice melts. Many people live near coasts, so rising sea levels could cause serious problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, creating environmental refugees. Small island countries might disappear if sea levels rise too much, causing problems for their people and other countries that need to help them.'"
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong and healthy. This is the plan of millionaire Dennis Tito. He wants to send a capsule to Mars on 5 January 2018. The capsule will go about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. This is important because the next chance to go to Mars is in 2031. New technology is needed for this mission. If everything is ready in time, the spacecraft might go. Even if it does not go, the work will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"'AESTHETICS Sometimes, the way we think about art makes it hard to understand. Art is often seen as just a physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue. But real art is about what these objects do to our experience. Some art is so admired that it becomes hard to see it in new ways. When art becomes famous, it can seem separate from the people and times that created it. This makes it hard to see its true meaning. Art is often put in a special place, away from everyday life. People who study art need to connect it back to daily life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human life. To understand art, we sometimes need to look away from it and think about everyday experiences. We can enjoy flowers without knowing about plants, but to understand them, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. To understand art, we should start with simple experiences that catch our attention and make us happy. Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comics without thinking of them as art. When art is only in museums, people find enjoyment in everyday things. Some people think art is separate from daily life, but the best times for art are when it is connected to everyday things.'"
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often think that lions hunt in a special way. They imagine lions working together like a team to catch their food. In the evening, lions come out of the shadows and surround their prey. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, which is to get their next meal. But after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. We started our research in 1978. We wanted to know why lions hunt together, take care of their cubs, and scare away other animals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its babies survive, then working together might not always be good. If an animal is too kind, others might benefit more. So, why do lions work together? We thought we would find the answer in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. It took us a long time to learn about their behavior. Wild lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now finding answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
Bedrock's third album was very important for the band. The album, called ""New Life,"" changed rock music in the country. The old style of rock music was serious and had loud guitars. The new style was lighter and mixed different sounds. The album had songs about everyday life and feelings. It also had fun and humor. The band used different sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. The album had 16 songs, and all of them were very good. There were no bad songs on the album.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I loved stories about ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from the past. My mother told me a story about one Sibyl. She offered nine books to a king for a lot of money. He said no, so she burned three books and offered six for the same price. He said no again, so she burned three more. He finally bought the last three books for the full price. I learned a lesson from this story. I was often lonely as a child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they said no. My mother told me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I wanted to find something I cared about. I don't like traveling much, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to go. I like to learn about old places because I enjoy thinking about the past.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript to a publisher, it goes into a big pile. Someone will look at it, usually a young person or an older person who works part-time. They want to find something new and interesting. If they like your book, they will show it to a more important editor. Then, it will be discussed in a meeting. The editor will need to explain why your book is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about if you, as an author, can be successful in the future. Publishers often want to meet the author before making a decision."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising Challenges in the 1990s**
In the early 1990s, people working in advertising had a very hard time. The economy was bad, and many people lost their jobs. In Britain, in 1991, the economy went down, interest rates were high, people spent less money, and many homes were taken back by banks. Many businesses suffered, especially car and building companies.
Advertising workers felt a lot of pressure. They had to do more work with less money. Even though marketing became more important, it was not easy. Companies started to focus on making products that customers wanted, not just what was easy to make. This change helped marketing people, but it also made their jobs harder.
In the 1980s, advertising was very successful, but the 1990s were tough. The bad economy made companies look closely at how much they spent on advertising. They wanted to know if it was worth the money. Many companies were not sure if advertising was helping them.
Companies wanted better advertising strategies and creativity. They wanted the best people to work hard for them. Advertising people had to find ways to do more with less money. The recession made it hard to take risks, which are often needed for good advertising.
Other challenges included changes in population, stronger retailers, changing customer needs, more sponsorships, and stricter advertising laws. Some companies also had to learn how to advertise in other countries.
Because of these challenges, advertising people had to think about how to make their ads work better. It was hard to find help or advice because everyone was busy dealing with these problems. Books and seminars did not always provide useful information. Many successful companies kept their secrets to themselves."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not common among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job. Chefs work long hours, have a lot of pressure, and do not earn much money. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was hard, and the social life was not fun. Cooking seemed serious and honest, unlike my college life. I also loved the art of cooking. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and cooking big meals. My history degree was not important to me anymore.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming teacher was a small, strong man with tattoos. He used to be a drill sergeant. I asked him to teach me how to dive. He told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this for an hour. Next time, I stood up and dived off the edge. The teacher was strict. He said, ""Don't look down, look up!"" and ""Keep your legs straight."" The next week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I was scared. I tried to remember what he taught me and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, my dive was not good. The teacher was not happy, but I felt free and happy.
**The Traveller**
Some people love adventure. They do not care about a comfortable bed or running water. They climb dangerous mountains and sail alone in the sea. They eat strange food if they have to. These people are different from most of us. We like our safe lives with microwaves and phones. We think these adventurers are strange, but they live in a world we do not know.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time sailing. He is not the best sailor, but he is good. He sails because he likes to write about it. His boat has a device that tells him where he is. He likes this device, but he thinks other sailing tools, like the compass, are not good. He believes the compass changed how people connect with the sea. Now, sailors look at the compass instead of the waves. The sea is just a space now. This is why Raban has time to watch the waves closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books help us feel at home in the world. We see our own experiences in stories from long ago or far away. In books, we find our thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were only ours. They express our thoughts clearly. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves. Reading and travel help us escape our daily routine. Our eyes are open in a new place, just like when we read a great book. We notice things we ignored before, like the sky, a friend's actions, or a hidden sadness.
**Author's Note**
These travel stories were first in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I added back some small parts the editor cut. I fixed a few mistakes, but not many. In the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. I didn't change the article to predict this because it was written at that time. Like other travelers, I was there, not knowing the future, trying to understand what had happened. This is the story of travel: the world opening to people with just a ticket. I believe travelers can see things clearly. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism words that are overused, ""ecotourism"" would win. It started in the 1980s when people cared more about the environment. Travelers wanted to know their trips didn't harm nature. It became a popular label for holidays. Now, ecotourism includes many things, like living with tribes or a boat trip. Any tour with culture, nature, or adventure is called ecotourism. The original idea was good, helping people make informed choices. But without rules, travelers are confused about what ecotourism really means.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my Transylvanian travel notes for 50 years and found them by luck. They helped me write about that time, but not perfectly. In Transylvania, I stayed in friendly homes for weeks. When I stopped traveling, I stopped writing. I thought there was nothing to write about. I was slow to start writing again. I worried some details were out of order, but then I decided it didn't matter. This book is not a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is not just a modern thing. It has been around for a long time. Many people think fashion started in the 1800s and 1900s, but it actually began much earlier. Historians say fashion started to grow in the 1500s and 1600s when trade and markets became important. As societies grew and new ways to make clothes were found, the meanings of clothes also changed. Today, it is hard to say what any piece of clothing really means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.
**Writer**
People often think that all writers are rich and famous, but this is not true for most. Many writers have other jobs during the day and write in the evenings. Some writers, like me, do different small jobs to make money. I teach, run workshops, and write articles. I have heard about writing jobs at places like chocolate factories, but I have never had one. By doing many small jobs and with help from friends, I manage to write my books.
**Sudden Fame**
Our small shows around the country started to sell out, and we needed more security to handle the excited fans. We had to use secret ways to enter the places we performed to avoid being surrounded by fans. On our days off, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched everything we did, and our managers took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I started to feel more confident, but it was still overwhelming."
CPE_31,C2,"'Music - The Future Ahead Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians. More people can listen to music now, and this will probably continue because music is important to us. Music is part of big events in the country and gives people many activities to do. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be. Also, will people still want to learn to play instruments? I think they will. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that music can help with spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. In Europe, group music lessons help with social skills and focus in children. Playing an instrument might also help with skills like good study habits and being on time. Because of these reasons, people will still want to learn instruments. In the future, music might change. People might listen to more types of music, mixing different styles. Technology will help people compose and perform music, making it easier for everyone to create music. But, this might mean fewer live performances. More people of all ages might want to make music together in their communities, reflecting their traditions. To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. Music lessons and progress checks will need to change to stay relevant. Musicians will need to learn how to teach and inspire people of all ages, work with large groups, and have skills for community work. This is a big change from the past. We also need to show how important music is. Music is a big part of our lives, but we often forget this. People in the music world need to work together to change this.'"
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This happens because actors often talk about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" But instead, actors often use big words or talk about gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once said that acting is only interesting when you do it. Talking about it makes it boring. Acting has no rules, except maybe being loud enough. With each new play, actors start fresh, learning from the characters and the writer. When the play ends, they feel empty until the next one.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man between boyhood and manhood. His performance is simple and confident. He understands the text well and controls his body and mind. Lester plays a young man who is angry but also funny and lovable. His acting is very good, even if it looks easy. Watch how he moves his body, like he is waiting to come alive. Handy, who plays Horatio, also shows this feeling. Acting makes us ask: What is acting? What is real behavior? Who controls these actors? This is an important question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called 'dropping in'. The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors sit quietly and listen. When it's their turn, they read a line, think about it, and then speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, imagine the scene, and then speak. The director says to find the reason to speak, called 'The pathway to the line'. Look at the other actor and think about your character. Don't plan too much. Trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre makes you feel important. Going to the theatre is special, and the staff should know that too. It's not good if the staff act like it's just a job. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well. The theatre should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong. Many old theatres got it right because they made the audience feel close to the stage. I like theatres with history, like old stone steps in a church. You can't please everyone with a play. People don't know what they want to see until they see it. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and exciting."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was very popular with young people. But it also changed the lives of older people and the middle class. It helped create new rock stars. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, listened to this exciting new music on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very important for future rock stars. Just like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He wanted to stop just listening and start making his own music.
**Snow Adventure**
I couldn't see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what I would do if the hole was deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. I knew I had to change my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books about qualitative research. They talk a lot about collecting data but not much about analyzing it. Many people find data analysis mysterious. So, we asked social scientists to share how they analyze data. We wanted to understand the process better, not just make a guidebook. This means making hidden steps clear. It sounds easy, but it is not. We let our contributors share their work in different ways, like personal stories or more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting like a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn't remember much. Many people like learning on the internet and computers, but is it a good way to learn? One writer tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words, but the son played with the pictures. ""If he spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something,"" said the father. TV, like my son and his noodles show, gives ideas but not details. Research says learning happens best with teachers or parents talking with children. New technology can help teach, but schools are still important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it at first. They thought Hollywood was bringing in rude people. But they accepted it because Hollywood was successful. Success in Hollywood means making a lot of money from movies. In less than 100 years, Hollywood became as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. It changed a lot: 100 years ago, there were orange groves. Now, it's a busy place. But it still feels like a small town. People in Hollywood talk about movies, who is dating who, and who is working on what project. Successful people often want to leave, but Hollywood is still the place for show-business. Many people in the industry end up there.
**Photography**
Photography was invented in the 1800s by artists. They wanted to keep a lasting record of what they saw. They used light, lenses, and chemicals to make pictures. These pictures were more real and detailed than paintings. Some artists didn't like this new art. They said photography wasn't real art because it used machines. But photographers knew they had a new way to show the world. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils. They showed nature, people, and things in a new way.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book had illustrations. This was also true for many novels for older children. But as time went on, there were fewer illustrations because books were printed in smaller numbers. Children's publishing was busy, but it didn't have a lot of money. This meant some work was not very good, but the best artists always did their best. The old black-and-white illustrations are a mix of good and bad work. They are interesting for research or just looking. Some of the best work will be shown again in new books or exhibitions. There are signs that people are starting to appreciate these old illustrations again. Soon, a publisher might make a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"'Blogging: Sharing with the World Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of telling everyone where you are online. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, 'Hey, I'm here' - but you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This shows that there might be problems with sharing too much online. The internet lets us share many parts of our lives with a lot of people. This can be exciting: maybe we can become rich or famous! So, we start sharing our secrets, photos, and stories online. But then we realize it can be dangerous and confusing. Is this sad? Maybe, but don't worry. Some people have already explored this online world. In the early days of the internet, they learned about the dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with being famous - all before social media existed. These people, the first bloggers, have already experienced what we are going through now. We should learn from them. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the 'WWW', which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at CERN in Switzerland for researchers to share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He wrote about himself and shared photos and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people read about his life. Hall shared everything: if you met him, you might end up on his site. One day, his website disappeared, and there was only a sad video called Dark Night. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you. The blog stopped, but the problem is still here. Sharing online is fun. But if you think it will make people like you, you might be wrong. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, someone at work sent her blog to the bosses, and she lost her job. People who study online behavior call this the 'online distribution effect': we feel we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. If we forget this, we can make big mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. She was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started her blog again, writing about her family. Now, she is a famous 'mommy blogger' and her blog helps support her family. She learned that just because we can say anything online, it doesn't mean we should.'"
CPE_23,C2,"'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired. In busy and rich countries, people often cannot sleep well. In the USA, 40 million people have sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books talk about people who cannot sleep. People are interested in sleep: how it works, why we need it, and problems with sleeping. A sleep expert says, 'People need more sleep. They sleep less when they are busy. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' A researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep. In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise affects sleep, and how tired drivers are dangerous. They ask students to help with their studies. Students get paid and change their sleep for the study. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put wires on their heads. But the study is about the body, not dreams. In a dark room, there is a car simulator. People come at 2 pm, after little or no sleep. They drive and answer questions. The road looks endless, and the sun is bright. The air is warm. People say they will not sleep, but they do. Dr. Reyner has a video of one person trying not to sleep. At first, he is awake, but then he blinks and nods off. The car goes off the road. Coffee can help. Two cups can make you a safe driver for 30 minutes. Dr. Reyner suggests coffee, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum. Shift workers might need them. We know some things about sleep. Humans sleep in cycles like other animals. There are four stages of sleep, from light to deep. Dreams happen in light sleep. The brain stops the body from moving to prevent injury. Scientists know women sleep 30 minutes more than men, and older people need less sleep, but they do not know why. In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people slept in two parts. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was quiet and good for thinking. Poor people liked this time because they were free from work. By the 17th century, with more light, rich people started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer, so they slept less. In some places outside Europe and America, people still sleep in parts. They sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noise and danger make it hard to sleep all night. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"'I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I was not a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and knew I didn't belong there. I flew in from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy, but that feeling went away when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He wore a dirty T-shirt and needed a shave. He looked at my new boots and walked away. 
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore. I wondered what to do next. I thought about being a commentator for races, but there were many others wanting that job. I also tried selling classic cars, but it didn't work out. Being an 'ex' racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became World Champion. Even if I was champion, people would only listen for a short time.
I miss racing cars. I miss the speed and the excitement. I miss being famous, even a little. People used to want my autograph. Now, my phone hardly rings. I have a lot of free time. I looked at the sky and saw some birds. They seemed to tell me to leave. I realized I have a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people walk down the city streets. If you walk with them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has a mild climate, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe environment, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about the new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow. People used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. I think it's because we try too hard to make our writing perfect, so we lose the natural feeling of a letter. Real artists, like Shakespeare, don't have this problem. They know how to make their words powerful without thinking too much about it.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A famous person would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open all the time, so they don't need celebrities anymore. Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy store didn't care who opened it. They just wanted to be first inside. The first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news made the people at the front happy and the latecomers jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. There was a lot of talk about it before it was released. The release was delayed because people were worried about William Randolph Hearst, who the film was said to be about. Even though the reviews were very good, the film did not make much money at first. It was television that made it popular again. Many people who want to make movies say it inspired them. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said he succeeded because he didn't know what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, writer Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a movie about a newspaper owner who was like Hearst. Welles thought this was a great chance for him to be both the director and the actor, so he worked very hard on it.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped at the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she didn't really hear or understand. Dermot asked, ""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" Carmel smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking I had nothing to do all day, so I was going to walk downtown and look at the shops. I thought it was almost a bad thing, just spending the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You're allowed to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" Carmel replied, ""No, that's fine.""
**Title Race**
Job titles can be funny. A recent study showed that job titles can make people jealous and unhappy at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles can cause problems among workers. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would rather have a better job title than a pay raise. If people care more about titles than money, it shows we have a problem. Today, nobody wants to be called a subordinate. The titles focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"'The Vienna Assignment I was in Vienna to take photos. That was usually why I traveled. Photos were more than my job. They were part of my life. I loved how light looked on things. One photo could show the feeling of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo. As long as I had film, I kept trying. I once took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. It was in newspapers and magazines everywhere. It was just luck. After that, I worked for myself. It seemed smart, but things didn't go as planned. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere with big news. But I was still taking photos and getting paid. That was good enough for me. I got the Vienna job by chance. I took photos in London for a book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the job in Vienna. They asked me to take his place. I was free, and they liked my work. I was happy to go. Things at home were not good. A week in snowy Vienna sounded nice. They put me in a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife. It was summer and very busy. I didn't take many photos then. This time, in cold January, it would be different. I knew it when I saw the city covered in snow. I was going to enjoy it and take great photos. The first day, I just rode the trams and looked around. I wanted to see the city in my own way. A photo is a moment, and you have to wait for it. The next morning, I went out early. The snow made the city look new. I wanted to take a photo of the cathedral, but it was too big. I had to find a way to capture its magic. Photography has always been magical. Even when you know how it works, it still feels mysterious. Maybe that's why what happened that morning didn't surprise me.'"
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**
Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place full of wonder. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. The exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves has been important, even if not many people know about it. The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for a long time, put it together. There are not many texts explaining the art, so visitors can enjoy discovering things on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art is liked by many people, even those who do not usually like art. People might like it because it is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing subjects. Some people might like Hockney because of his interesting personality. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. But maybe he seems less important because he is very popular. Hockney knows he is not a great artist and believes only time will tell how important his work is.
**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**
I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not. I do not like shows that try to push a certain idea. As a curator, I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. Our show, ""Window-shopping,"" was a collection of different artworks. Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley broke a video camera, and it flickered on a screen. These works were very different, but they worked well together. I did not try to make a big statement about art. Art is personal, and artists decide what they want to do.
**Art History**
People who like paintings sometimes do not want to analyze them. They think it might ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus on theory and forget about the pleasure of looking at art. This is like thinking that knowing how a dish is made will make it taste worse. But knowing more about art can make it more enjoyable. Our likes are influenced by society, not just by our personal taste. While enjoying art is important, thinking about it does not have to take away from the experience."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age might have liked shiny things. One day, someone sitting by a river might have found a shiny yellow stone. It was not like other stones, but it was pretty. This is how people might have found gold. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so people wanted it. Copper might have been found by accident too. When people saw that copper tools were useful, they looked for more copper. This is how people started working with metals.
**St Ives**
We walked down a small, winding street with our bags. The wind was very strong, and the waves were cold and big. No one was outside, and the houses were closed up tight. We saw the weather get worse as we came into St Ives on a small train. The sky was grey, and visiting Cornwall without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I told my friend we would have nice walks by the sea and warm evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in peace or hard times are not here anymore. We do not know why they moved or stayed in one place. Archaeology gives us some ideas, but we cannot test them. We cannot see the past again. But maybe we can. With computer modelling, we can make old places and put digital people in them. These digital people can act like real people. We can change things like rain or the number of people and see what happens."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the leader male monkey saw a new male monkey near their trees. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the leader might lose his position. The leader monkey had a clever idea. When the new monkey tried to come closer, the leader made a sound that means a leopard is near. The new monkey ran back to his trees. This happened many times. But then, the leader made a mistake. He made the leopard sound while walking calmly on the ground.
**What Cats Catch**
In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw this and thought all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: are there still enough birds? The answer is yes. In winter, people feed birds, and gardens have places for birds to live. The survey showed cats catch many birds, but they are not destroying the bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make tired sounds as they go to the reed beds. They stand at the edge of the platform, making noises about the hard day ahead. Finally, the leader buffalo moves into the water. In the water, they seem to forget their plan and stay there for a while. Slowly, they start swimming, looking very tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants they find.
**PICASSO, Pablo**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish while staying in a fishing port. The painting shows a fishmonger's table with a crab and some fish. The fish look alive. The painting is hard to understand because Picasso used flat shapes and soft colors. It looks calm, like underwater. But there is tension. The fish and crab look ready to fight. The sharp shapes and a chain around a fish add a feeling of danger. This gives the painting a special meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"'Photography Photography has been used for about 150 years to capture all parts of human life. It helps us see moments that are very quick or very small and brings us pictures from faraway places and even space. Photography shows us the complex and difficult parts of modern life. It is a powerful way to show what it means to be human. But, using pictures to record events is much older. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We do not know why these early pictures were made. They might show hunting events, be used for magic, be religious, or just to make homes nicer. Pictures are an important part of human culture. People have always asked if pictures show the truth and what their role in society is. The saying 'seeing is believing' gives pictures a special place. When photography was invented in the 1800s, it was thought to give a true picture of the world. The camera was seen as a machine like the human eye, making images that looked real. The chemical process of photography captured images that seemed natural. Photography was seen as a great cultural achievement, creating images that artists had worked hard to make by hand. People thought everyone could understand photos, like a 'universal language'. In 1933, photographer August Sander said even a person living far away could understand a photo of the sky. But as global communication grew, we began to ask if photos can be understood the same way by everyone. Is photography like language, shaped by culture? Do we take photos for granted and forget how they show reality? Photography is often seen as clear evidence, making it hard to tell the difference between real life and photos. It is common for someone to show a photo and say 'this is my grandson'. Since its start in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. It has moved from just keeping records to being part of history. Photos now tell us about the people and society that made them, not just the subject. Photography is not just a quiet recorder of events. It can inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 1400s changed how people saw the world with new art techniques. Photography has helped create our media culture and shows the tough realities of the world.'"
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a field with hidden dangers. You need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can cause problems. It's hard to say exactly how to write poetry, so it's better to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination be free. Some people need to feel safe to write a poem, while others write when they are sad. Some people write on a schedule, and others wait for inspiration. All ways are good if you are true to yourself. It's important to listen to your inner voice and let it grow.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if needed. A character's memory can help move the story forward. Dialogue, or talking between characters, is useful because it shows different sides of a story quickly. A short story should not have too many words, but it should still have conflict and action. Every word should be important.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know what will happen next, but you learn as you go. In chess, you need a long-term plan, not just short moves. Over time, you see the whole game and notice patterns. Writing a screenplay is similar; the more you do it, the more you understand.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin said that speaking is natural for humans, but writing is not. All people speak, but not all people write. Writing systems were created by a few advanced societies and improved over time. In the past, many children did not learn to read or write. Even today, some children find it hard. Speaking comes naturally, but writing is something we must learn carefully. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"'I have never started a book with more worry. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader unsure. This book is about my memories of a man I met only sometimes, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up parts to fill the gaps and make the story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I only want to write what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the people in this story made-up names, and I have tried to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When he dies, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river. Then my book, if read at all, will be read only for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong and kind character will influence others, so that, long after his death, people will realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I write about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book will be a useful source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I have written are exact. I never kept notes of what was said, but I have a good memory for what matters to me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words, they represent what was said. I said earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to put words in the mouths of people in my story that I did not hear myself. I have done this to make the scenes more lively and real. I want to be read, and I think I am right to make my book interesting. The smart reader will see where I have used this trick, and he can choose to ignore it. Another reason I am worried about this work is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is hard to know people, and I don't think you can really know anyone but your own countrymen. People are not only themselves; they are also the place they were born, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they went to, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't know them by just hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. Because you cannot know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done otherwise in short stories, it is because you can describe your characters briefly. You give the reader broad hints and let him fill in the details. In this book, I do not pretend that my characters are as they see themselves; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes.'"
CPE_4,C2,"'POETRY RECITALS Today, poetry can be confusing because there are many different styles and ideas about poetry. Some poets write poems to be read in books, while others like to perform their poems in front of people. This has been happening more and more over the last twenty years. Small groups in towns have poetry readings in local halls or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings by famous poets. 
For poets who like to perform, these events are good. Their poems are simple and easy to understand when heard. But for poets who focus on writing with deep meaning and complex style, it can be hard for people to understand their work when they hear it for the first time. These poets might choose to read their simpler poems to connect with the audience quickly.
Listening to poetry is not the same as reading it. Hearing a poet read can help understand the poem better, but it is good if the audience can read along or know the poems before. The main reason for poetry recitals is to make people enjoy poetry and see it as something fun, not just for experts.'"

Historians are using more oral evidence, but it has problems. When someone talks about the past, it is not always clear or true. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is influenced by both the historian and the person talking. Memories can also be mixed with things from TV or other people. Sometimes, people remember the past as better than it was or feel sad about things that happened later. These feelings can make the story seem true, but they might not be from the time being talked about.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animals: looking at how their bodies work and looking at their behavior. Physiologists study how nerves and muscles work together. People who study the whole animal look at how animals act and what affects them. There are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists study how animals learn, often in labs with rats and pigeons. Ethologists study how animals act naturally, often in the wild. These two groups are now working more together. Even if we know how every nerve works, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Trying to explain a bird building a nest by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
When students start studying social sciences, they need to learn two things: the content and the methods. They need to know the facts and how these facts are found and organized. Social sciences are not just common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of social life and uses different methods and ideas. These ideas help social scientists understand more than everyday common sense and make each social science different.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said it was about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He used Greek words for some of these ideas. Utility and function were not part of his main definition, but he did talk about the best ways to build for different uses. The focus was on beauty and art. Classical architecture started from simple huts in Greece and Italy. These huts were not artistic but gave basic forms that later became part of classical architecture. Even if a classical temple looks fancy, it is basically a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"'The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily drove around the allotments, railway line, and gasworks. She once made a mistake on a small bridge, but Chen was amused by her driving. 'So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!' he said. Mui thought Chen should be upset, but he was happy and planned a trip with Lily. They chose a Monday next month, the quietest day, to leave early and return by midday. Lily practiced driving around the allotments. Mui bought a road-map with a discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation. 
In an hour, they reached the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was ready to give directions, had to agree. Lily overtook some slow cars with great skill. Chen even applauded. They drove through the gasworks of a seaside town, past a lagoon with small boats, and along an empty promenade. Lily parked in a street with empty parking spaces. She was unsure about road markings and preferred to pay a fee to avoid problems. Lily locked the van doors carefully. Chen joked, 'No one will want that old van.' The sisters were annoyed. Lily said Chen was ungrateful, and Mui said he was too proud. Chen took Man Kee to see the sea. He decided to give Man Kee a good education and teach him about the restaurant business.
Chen felt happy as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship on the sea and used a telescope to look at it. He showed Man Kee the ship and said it was special for them. It would take them back home one day. Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them. Chen let Man Kee look through the telescope. When Lily tried, the ship was gone, and she only saw seagulls.'"
CPE_43,C2,"**The Well**
I read that if you dig a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I asked you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket and climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough. You tried to hold the handle, but I fell into the well. I hit my head. I saw strange lights, like stars in cartoons when someone gets hit. I was scared and then angry at you for letting me fall. I worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I didn't answer. You ran to get help. I climbed out of the well and hid. I heard voices and saw you with Mother, Father, and Arthur. They were worried. I felt happy but then saw the wet trail I left. I was scared they would find me. Mother was screaming. I knew I was in trouble. I thought of a plan. I came out, pretending to be hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. Father asked me to repeat my story. I said the tunnel fell in after me. Father didn't believe me. He looked at me like he saw me for the first time. Arthur looked sad, like he knew I was lying. I felt ashamed."
CPE_51,C2,"'MOVING DAY Susan, a widow, is moving out of her family home because her children are grown up. The moving van said, 'Removers of Distinction'. Susan noticed that everything special in the house was being packed in boxes. Fred, the removal man, was carefully handling all the fragile items. The house was beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbour. Susan remembered the years spent there with her children, Robert and Francesca. Robert, now an adult, was helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca was also helping, making sure the piano was handled carefully. Fred said, 'She doesn't look like she's going to cry,' and Susan asked if people usually cry. Fred explained that people often cry when they see their things being taken apart, but they feel better at the new place. Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano was a problem because it got stuck on the stairs. Her husband, Peter, solved the problem by taking out a window and using a crane to bring the piano in. Now, Susan was worried about moving the piano out. Fred and his team managed to move it safely. Susan, Robert, and Francesca laughed with relief when it was done. As they left the house for the last time, Susan only cried tears of laughter.'"
CPE_11,C2,"'Online Book Reviews for Everyone
The Internet lets everyone share their opinions. At first, you needed some computer skills to do this. But one area that became open to everyone was book reviews. Amazon.com, the first big online bookshop, allowed anyone to write a review. People could say what they thought about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a great idea because it let buyers see what other readers thought, not just what the publisher or professional critics said.
Amazon had many reviews because it was the biggest online bookstore. But this also led to some problems. Many reviews were submitted every day, so it was hard to check them all. Amazon had rules: no single-word reviews, no personal attacks, no bad language, no spoilers, and no talking about other reviews. But reviewers were anonymous, so some people played tricks. For example, some writers wrote fake good reviews for their own books. One writer, Lev Grossman, did this until he admitted it in an article, and then the fake reviews were removed.
Authors could also comment on their books. Most used this to say nice things and hope people would buy their books. Some even shared their email addresses. But Amazon did not always check if the comments were really from the author, except for famous writers. For example, a fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed.
Sometimes, readers' reviews caused problems. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team came out, some people in the book were angry and wrote bad reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days.
Amazon liked that people spent time writing reviews because it was good for business. They watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were more common on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" got a funny review comparing it to Internet technology.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious and helped people decide if a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books was hard because you had to pretend to have feelings about them. So, letting everyone review books was a good idea.'"
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last 200 years, people think artists must be different from others. We like art that is new and surprising. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But with today's art, we sometimes say it is not art. The media often say this, and we agree. We think art should be new, so we miss the old ideas and skills in today's art. We want artists to be special and different from us. In the past, people asked artists to make art for specific reasons. Now, artists work alone, and we get upset if they try to be like everyone else.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text asks, ""What are pictures about?"" and says, ""There are many kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. The question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June
Artists often stick to one style to be successful. People like to see the same kind of art from an artist. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, change styles and succeed. Eric Rimmington is trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He made drawings of railways in the 1980s and now paints the underground world. His show, ""Underground Encounters,"" has 40 paintings and drawings of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers say only a sick person would come here to rebuild. I am here to heal myself. Only an old woman from the village visits to clean the house. I am alone, not happy or sad. I think about memories. Art is not useless; it helps us see reality differently. Art lets us deal with things that hurt us in life. It helps us use our imagination to find meaning. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"'Family Business'
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from my school. I had won the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. My father talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I knew what he was thinking. My father usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to be brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, ""I feel you won't want to be in the family business now. You'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""
Like many children, I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to explore other jobs. But I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him strong.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was often right, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant.""
My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and I often took care of him. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived well - a big house in London, good schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always lively.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then decide. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making a decision. My father would get upset if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school, and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on easy tasks. I became a smart student, with a little house, a small white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me. He took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law. I felt confident and focused.
But my father told me he needed me for one last job, the most important for the family business. He promised it would be worth it.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams soon, and I need to focus. It's really important.""
I could tell my father didn't understand my pressures, or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him. He would see a refusal as a betrayal.
As he explained the job, I saw his dedication and energy. He was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency with a higher salary. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space and a garden. They could have found a bigger place in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted a better address. She felt their old address wasn't good enough for a young lawyer and a successful businesswoman.
To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day at work. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as his. They needed both their salaries to maintain their lifestyle.
Now, their situation was at risk because of Venetia. She came to their office upset and accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed a jury four years ago. She also said Cartwright gave shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial didn't sound convincing. He felt guilty and remembered being punished as a child. Venetia didn't believe him, and he worried about what she might do. If the rumor spread, his career could be ruined."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous. I hoped people here wouldn't care if the houses looked old and the gardens were messy. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, but tonight, I am watching the birds fly. I made space for a chair in the garden, and my arms are scratched from cutting plants. It's a small London garden. My neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She writes books that aren't published, and I sometimes talk about them because I am an English teacher. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she says. 'I'll bring a drink down.' I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I see it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says. She sits on the chair while I put a cushion on the grass. 'Cheers,' she says. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't have holidays. They say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What plans for the holidays?' she asks. I feel worried about the school year ending. Empty days. Hot streets. The walk to the shops. The park with its fountain, and feeling lonely. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask. 'Of course,' Jaz says. 'If I'm around,' knowing she will be. 'Where will you stay?' 'With my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks. Her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans, is on my desk. I like the title and tell her. I can see how red vans could be cruel, bringing gifts to other houses and returned manuscripts to hers. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change,' I say. 'Teachers!' Jaz says, upset. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.' I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calm. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age, winking and saying, 'I've had my moments.' We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people with the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and their stories. But we also need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of belonging and continuity. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture from past generations. Even if there are parts of our heritage we don't like, it is still ours. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It affects our customs and traditions. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. But now, because of changes in society, many of these stories are lost. Instead, we learn from places and buildings that remind us of the past. It is important to keep these links to honor our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I wrote a book called ""Waterland"" about a place in England called the Fens. At first, I thought the Fens were just flat and empty, a good setting for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not just flat or empty. They are very English but also strange and mysterious. Many people in England find the Fens different from other places. The Fens are both wild and cultivated, open yet mysterious. I didn't visit many places in the Fens while writing my book. As a fiction writer, I like to imagine places rather than just describe them. The Fens are not just a landscape; they are also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, museums just put things in cases with long labels. Now, displays should be interesting and use creative ways to catch people's attention. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can lend objects to schools or use them to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums show real objects, not copies. They help people see and understand things from the past. This is what makes them different from theme parks or books. Museums that make their displays exciting and accessible will attract more visitors.
**Architecture and Environment**
People have always wanted to keep things from the past, but now changes in our towns happen very quickly. This makes some people want to preserve things more. People who have lived through big events, like wars, often want to keep things stable. If people need preservation, city planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used to sell smart products like computers and books. Many people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he made some difficult theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions. Einstein was part of a big change in science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better by studying matter and forces. Einstein helped by looking at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before, people thought time and space were the same for everyone, but Einstein said they are different for each person.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not like prize-winning books because we thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this, but our father would give us money to read these books. He also gave us some good books as gifts, saying they were not just literature. We thought most of these books were for boys, but we did read some short stories and a book of poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm said that the start of human language is a big mystery. Many strange ideas have come from this mystery. In 1928, Charles Caller said early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. Some people thought these sounds became words like ""malaria"" for ""fever"" or ""mors"" for ""death"". Because of these strange ideas, many people did not talk about the origin of language. But now, it is an important research area. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly talking and power struggles, not just for sharing information."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Reviews are often written quickly and are not kept for long. They have deadlines and are usually short. Once published, they are only read for a short time, like a day or a week. People often think reviews are not important. Many believe writers do reviews because they need money or because they can't work on their main projects all the time. But writing reviews is a skill. It is different to write a short review for a newspaper and a long one for a journal. Reviewers must think about who will read their work, from casual readers to those very interested in the topic. A good reviewer knows a lot about many things and can write clearly. Reviewers often write other things too. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews when he is not working on his novels. He collects his reviews in books. Some people think only famous writers should keep their reviews, but others believe anyone can if they want to. I feel the same about my work. I am mainly an academic, and my serious books are for professors. In English-speaking countries, it is common for people to both review and study literature. In the past, some academics did not like professors writing reviews, but now it is more accepted. There are more reviews today, so many people can write them. I think this is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It is also good for professors because it helps them communicate better with non-professors. Writing reviews is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. It was dark and quiet inside. Even after three years, he sometimes felt strange when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the apartment, he was excited to come home. He would wonder what the apartment was like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment was always there, waiting for him. Sometimes it looked neat, and other times it looked messy, depending on how he left it.
Over time, Ralph started to see the apartment as just another part of himself. It was a place where he could relax and be alone. He liked to see the letters by the door and the blinking light on the answering machine when he got home. He was glad nothing was broken or stolen. From his small office on the Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings at home. After leaving work, he felt more like himself on the bus ride home. He wanted to be alone with his things, but once he was home, he felt empty. He thought that working at a job he didn't like had changed him.
Ralph often read or listened to music at night. But he started to wonder why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. After university, he wanted to make a plan for his future, but he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends. He followed their paths, not thinking about his own happiness. He went to one job interview and was happy to have a nice talk with Neil, his boss. Neil offered him the job because Ralph was the only graduate who applied. At the time, Ralph thought this was a compliment."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was moving to the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. A part of the area was marked for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track. They tried to keep some special goats in order. It was not easy because goats like to eat anything they find.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I thought about the night and felt scared. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was no place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs. The torch batteries were low, so we put in new ones, but they did not work. We could not find a camping place. A few miles later, Lesley said she saw a light, and we felt hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard loud water rushing, but we could not see it. Time felt slow, and we kept moving.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and shareholders. How can I get better at it and feel more confident? You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you say. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework and prepare well. Ask colleagues to think of difficult questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"'Some things cannot be rushed. They need time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too fast to mayonnaise, it will not work. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot gets tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things we do very fast, like solving puzzles. But some things need more time. If we rush them, they will not work well, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line. We learn and think in different ways. Some things need fast thinking, like when you are in danger. For example, when my motorbike slipped on a wet road, my body reacted fast to keep me safe. This fast thinking is called 'wits'. Other times, we need to think slowly and carefully, like when solving a problem or making a decision. This is called 'intellect'. Sometimes, we need to think even slower, like when we are dreaming or relaxing. This slow thinking is also important. It helps us understand difficult things. Scientists say that slow thinking is good for solving complex problems. When we do not know what to do, it is better to think slowly. This slow thinking is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have always known this. Now, scientists are also studying slow thinking. They find that the mind can do amazing things if we give it time. It can see patterns and solve problems that are too hard for fast thinking.'"
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I am in a friendly place. It is a camp with many things we need, but it is very far from other places. There are about forty people here. They are scientists, students, and other workers. We all help each other. I can speak a little French, but not very well. I cannot make jokes or have long talks. I miss small details in conversations, and my phrasebook does not help at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt shy. I was nervous about eating with others. I did not know which table to sit at. I was scared when everyone was quiet and I had to speak. I felt like I was back in school. I still smile a lot or get nervous when people talk to me. I think I feel sad sometimes because I cannot talk as much as I want. I am used to being good at talking.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was a new writer. He did not pay much attention to me. But he always remembered people. When we met again, he was friendly but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at a show with important people, he did not notice me. But then I became a successful playwright. Elliot started to like me more. One day, he invited me to lunch. I thought he wanted to know me better. After my success, I met many new friends, and I saw Elliot more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
Alfred Hitchcock was a film director. He said he did not care much about the story or acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and sounds. He thought people liked films because of how they looked and sounded, not because of the story. He believed that if a film was made well, people from different countries would feel the same emotions. Hitchcock was very smart and knew what he wanted. He liked to make people feel scared when watching his films. He focused on making films that were beautiful and made people feel something."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were few, and there were not many books on practical astronomy. Today, you can buy many types of telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. But, some things are not as good. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to see a sky like the one in cities 50 years ago. Airplanes leave trails in the sky that can last for hours, making it hard to see the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are many things to do and many options. People always want the new product or service. Technology makes things change fast. There are many new goods and services, giving more choices. When a new product comes out, another one is ready to be launched. This can make people tired and stressed. More choice means more stress and less time. People now look for simple things that give meaning. But, it is hard to make life simple when there are so many products. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother. It is very important to us. We are a special group at McAndrews: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the bad manners of shop assistants today. I do not like waiters who try to be too friendly. I know most of the guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children. But, we only say a polite hello. Respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
A special show of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" moved from Stratford to London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show started last spring. I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and I was wrong about his acting. I still think Othello should be older than Desdemona, but Mr. Fearon's acting is great. The whole cast is great. Some memorable scenes are when Cassio plays games with other officers and things get dangerous, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very moving. The show is exciting and full of tension. Don't miss it.
**Lake Vostok**
In the middle of Antarctica, there is no life. On the edges, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But inside, on the big white ice, there is no life. Except for a big hidden lake called Lake Vostok, under 4 kilometers of ice, at the coldest place on earth. The water has been without air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are excited to explore the lake and find strange life forms. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, scientists from around the world have been planning to study the lake. In the next few years, we will learn more about Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was something interesting on the radio last week. Some scientists are talking about why they want to be scientists. We know they want to learn about everything, from atoms to black holes. But they are asking why we want to know these things and why science can't explain this. It is more important to know if what scientists do is right, instead of talking about why we do it. The important thing is to see science as a tool, and we should decide how and when to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Food is important and makes us happy. Many people like cooking and buy cookbooks. We often think we need a special occasion to cook, but that's not true. You can make a tasty soup with just carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs. This is better than buying soup in a packet or can. Instead of buying chocolate mousse with many chemicals, you can make a delicious one in five minutes that everyone will love. Cooking is a way to show care and love. We often celebrate with food, like birthdays and weddings. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding party!
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his messy office. Papers were everywhere, and he had many books. He was going to meet Mallory, who was always on time and liked things neat. He worried about what she would think of the mess. Mrs. Wilson, the cleaning lady, came while he was cleaning. She didn't want to clean his office because it was too messy. She thought Alistair was from another world, not from her neighborhood in Brooklyn.
**Karen**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She made her own story of strength. When she was twelve, her brother accidentally hit her with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the doctor said she was okay. She only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, she felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking across the village green. She was excited and sad about what she saw. She was the first to know something important in her small village. She was sad because Dr. Bailey, her doctor, was not well. He was a good doctor who listened to his patients. He was loved by everyone in the village because he gave his time and care."
CPE_59,C2,"Joanna's Lessons
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She also writes books for children learning the piano. Joanna is famous for her amazing piano skills. She plays many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for children, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it for him. She believes the first piano lessons are very important.
Joanna has written a piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" She is very busy with concerts and running her own recording label, Sound Circus. But she still finds time to write because she cares about how children learn music. She thinks music should be for everyone, not just for those who want to be stars.
When Joanna was young, her mother taught piano at home. Many children came to learn, and Joanna saw how different they were. Some children learn fast, but others take their time. Joanna is interested in helping all children enjoy music, not just those who are very talented.
Joanna worries that some parents push their children too hard in music. She thinks music should be fun and not just about meeting parents' expectations. Her books are colorful and have stories to make learning fun. They come with CDs for children to play along with.
Joanna believes practice is very important. She didn't practice a lot until she went to the Royal Academy of Music. Now, she practices eight hours a day. She says practice is more important than performing. Her advice is to know what you want to achieve before you start practicing. Also, mix easy and hard pieces to keep it interesting."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said, ""If writing is easy, reading it is not fun."" This means good writing is hard. When I look at my old school essays, I see few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think it was because writing by hand was hard. Writing slowly made me think carefully. With computers, it is easy to make mistakes. Many writers spend the same time fixing computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be heavy with emotion. People say emails have brought back love letters. Many love emails are sent now, instead of just talking. That's good. At least they are written in some form of English. But words on a screen can be boring. Writers often don't know the power of words and can exaggerate. Words typed quickly lack the care of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the shiny disc was interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said. I agreed and gave the disc to him. ""Amazing they hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the music player. He pressed a button, and a drawer opened. He put the disc in and closed it. ""Some say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""No,"" Mr. Warriston said. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He thought and said, ""I don't know. You could have two lasers or turn it over by hand."" He smiled. ""Good point."" He pointed to my chair. ""Let's get you in the best place for the stereo sound."" I was happy to ask a question he couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said if matches came after lighters, we would think they are better. People say electronic text is like the invention of printing. They forget that big changes take time. In 1979, a book said, ""The 1980s will see books disappear."" That was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is hard, so people don't do it. Computers make people read bits of text. Some say this creates new ways of storytelling. But reading parts of a text is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. What is new is that computers don't encourage reading everything.
**The Office**
Charles walked into a tidy office. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood. Files were in drawers, and journals filled the shelves. Kathleen tried to close a filing cabinet and said, ""You need computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, looking at the room. He didn't think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She didn't understand why he didn't like technology, even though he was good with computers and wrote a paper on it. She inspired that paper. She could use a keyboard to change software into something new."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He found out that staying away caused problems. He thought about how he went from being an important advisor to someone always trying to fix problems. There was no place to park when he arrived at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" Lancelot had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one. Ian Cuthbert got a lot of money in advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, and Lancelot made a mistake by asking him to write books. Ian was proof that friends can be unreliable. Lancelot read the synopsis again. It was not new. He closed the folder. Ian's manuscript was not coming. The synopsis was not brilliant, and it seemed like Ian had lost interest. Lancelot remembered a story about a famous author whose last book was published after his death, chapter by chapter. But Ian had already been paid a lot. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre, but Ian did not succeed. He was difficult to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine, but it never came out. He had a contract with a fashion magazine, but he did not produce much. At meetings, Ian was critical and did not like other people's ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot thought that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,C2,"'Breakfast in England
Health experts say breakfast is very important. But in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, people did not often talk about breakfast. Sometimes, travelers ate early before long trips, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 
In the sixteenth century, breakfast became normal for everyone. Some people think this is because there was more food. But there were also big social changes. For example, people started working set hours and often began work very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for rich people.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal ideas, and culture. In this book, we will see how these things change the style and meaning of a photo. We will also see how people look at and feel about these photos. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they might think they understand the photos. But we can ask if the photo shows the scene as it really was. Or does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the exact moment important, or is the photo a symbol of something bigger?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves completely. You need to focus if you want to be the best. You have to put other things aside. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. You have to try hard or you will fail. Sport has taught me to be disciplined and determined. It also shows how to work well in a team. My sport lets you be great alone, but it is also a team game. It is like life - you can do well alone, but you must remember others. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened many opportunities for me and let me see the world. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences stay very clear in our memory. For me, one special moment happened one night in California. I was awake, listening to a bird singing beautifully in a tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's song kept me awake. The bird's music was like jazz and Indian music. It felt like the bird was performing a special show just for me. I listened and enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always talked about birds. But what do birds say about us? Paul Evans writes about this. There is a noise from the greenhouse. A small brown bird is hitting the glass. It is a wren. Some people think wrens bring messages or signs. Is it trying to tell me something? Or is it just stuck? Maybe both are true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people watched wrens to see if they would have good or bad luck. Today, we see wrens in pictures and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, people still like wrens. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because there is a lot of folklore about birds. In the past, people needed to understand nature to survive. They created stories about birds. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once common in London. People liked them because they cleaned the streets. But later, people thought they were pests, and they disappeared from most places except Wales. Now, red kites are protected and are a symbol of conservation. Our connection with birds is very old. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds are important, we also think about who we are. Birds can fly and sing, and we admire them for that. Some people think our feelings about birds are old and not needed now. But losing these feelings is hard. Birds show us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means losing part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have special meanings in stories and poems. Losing them is a big loss. But birds not in stories are often ignored. Folklore is important. Stories and songs about birds have a strong connection to them. They help us feel and think about birds in a way science cannot. Watching birds, whether on TV or in our gardens, is exciting. Birds are interesting, and we still do not fully understand why. The wren in the greenhouse makes me think about the past and the future. It is a mystery that keeps me wondering."
CPE_28,C2,"'Maps A map shows how places and features on the earth are related to each other. This is shown by distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like 'a few hours' walk' or 'a day's journey by river'. This told more about how easy it was to travel the land than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks along a route. These signs could be realistic or simple and were different sizes to show their importance. The way maps were made changed depending on their purpose and where they were made. So, when looking at old maps, it is important to understand how they were made. The history of making maps is about getting better at showing distance and direction and adding more details. Map makers used other sciences to help them. For example, they used the magnetic compass to find direction instead of using the sun or stars. They also used tools to measure angles accurately. As people explored more, they tried to map the world. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is slightly flat at the poles, which changed how large areas were mapped. Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Soldiers needed accurate maps for planning battles. Archaeologists, historians, and geographers also needed special maps. Today, map makers create maps showing many things, like weather, land use, and more. Maps are now very important in many sciences. The making of maps has not always been a smooth process. Sometimes, old ideas stayed around even when new ideas came. Map makers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since it was easy to copy old maps, some map makers did not want to change. So, maps should not always be seen as perfect evidence of what people knew at the time. Many maps we have today show a lot of human work and thought. They are a valuable record of human history. This is why studying old maps is so interesting and educational.'"
CPE_35,C2,"'TIM RICE I went into the young man's living room. It was a nice and calm place, different from the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and he had bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. He wanted to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me. But when Andrew suggested I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I decided to try. Andrew played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very good. He played more music from shows he had written at school. I had little to impress him with, except for a song I had written that was recorded by a pop group. We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theatre, but I thought Andrew was very talented and determined. I didn't want to miss the chance to work with him. The next day, at my office where I was training to become a lawyer, I wasn't as sure about a life in show business. I would keep looking for groups needing a singer and write more songs. But I thought I would probably become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. My father said I would stop liking pop music by the time I was twenty-one, which worried me. But I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to write musical lyrics with him. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture. I wasn't sure about his idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who started orphanages. The story didn't excite me, but Andrew believed in his music, and it was good. I didn't know much about musicals, but I decided to try. I skipped a day at the office, pretending to be sick, to write my first musical lyrics. I didn't know it then, but I had changed my career.'"
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have a special ability. We can use language to share ideas with each other. Language is very important in our lives. It is hard to think about life without it. If you see two or more people together, they will probably talk. When people are alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think language is like an 'instinct'. This means people know how to talk naturally, like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders did not learn to make webs from school or special training.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather are made by the air around us. They are very important for animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places can have tropical jungles with many different plants and animals. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day and makes the climate over time. Air moves because the earth spins and because of the sun. The sun is a big reason why air moves.
**Coffee**
I worked as a bar-person and served drinks. I also had to make coffee, which was a bit scary. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I had to learn a lot about making coffee and taking care of the espresso machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. After the first week, I realized making coffee is not easy. I thought I might have to do simple jobs like cleaning ash-trays again. But my boss was patient. He said, 'Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it.'"
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does TV often fail with art shows? Painting and sculpture are good for cameras. Cameras can show a whole artwork and then zoom in on details. But few TV series show the joy and complexity of art. An example is Robert Hughes's series, ""American Visions."" Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British viewers American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on great art. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are seen in art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer. I became known for taking risks. Metals are less controlled than other markets. With luck, risk-taking, and market knowledge, you can make a lot of money. Risk is a big part of the industry. This fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, free-trade economists see that the market does not keep metal prices high. More minerals are being taken, and raw material costs are going down. Adjusted for inflation, metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to check claims against a big company that benefits from cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. They stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island is unique and has something special. To get around Abaco, you need a boat. If your room does not include a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat. Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called ""The Sailing Capital of the World."" The calm waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"'Build your own bike at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop The Bamboo Bike Club, started by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, offers a course where you can make your own bike frame and have a fun weekend. It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can build a bamboo bike. I went to see what happens there. There is a lot of energy and fun. Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire are using bamboo, a method first used in 1894. But these bikes are expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame costs $2,995, or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes affordable. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to create a business where people could enjoy making their own bikes. The Bamboo Bike Club is more like a community. James and Ian have other jobs too. James makes wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. They offer monthly courses where you can design and build your own bike frame. On the first day, they teach you how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You glue the bamboo tubes together: first the front triangle, then the seat and chain parts. Metal tubes are used for the handlebars and other parts that need to be very strong. James and Ian help you with every step. If you make a mistake, you can try again. Bamboo is easy to work with. You can choose plain, black, or mottled bamboo. On Sunday, you wrap hemp around the joints and glue it to make the frame strong. Then you add a coating to make it waterproof. The bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and a saddle. The bike is strong and can last a long time. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested one off-road for three months. 'Our bikes are very strong,' James says. Bamboo bikes look different from professional bikes. The hemp can look like tape, but each bike is unique. I think bamboo bikes are best for a relaxed ride. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth ride. Bamboo bikes are light and easy to ride. I tried James's bike, and it was smooth and fun. The price? Less than £500.'"
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand how men and women can talk better to each other. This book is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry helps people who want to improve their lives. It also makes a lot of money for book publishers in New York. In Britain, many self-help books are published, but many are not very good. For every book published, many are not accepted because they are too similar to others. Editors look for books that can sell well. They ask questions like, ""Is the author easy to promote? Is the idea interesting to many people?"" Dione Reverend says that a good title is very important. It helps to sell the book.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, they make a promise to tell the truth. But often, writers do not tell everything. They might feel too embarrassed to share some things. Or they might think some details are not important. Sometimes, writers change the truth to make their story more interesting. They might even call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. Some readers might think they read a true story, but it is actually fiction. Writers do this not to be mean, but to tell a better story.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories became popular in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These stories show the problems in society. A crime in the story shows human desires like wanting more money. Solving the crime helps society work well again. In Hammett's stories, society is not perfect even after the crime is solved. The detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is both a good guy and a bit of a bad guy. He is not fully on the side of the law or the criminals. Sometimes, he feels guilty about this. Other times, he is very eager to catch the criminal because of this feeling.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at the Grand Hotel to talk about writing. We both felt out of place there. Gould said that to write well, you need to understand the culture you are writing about. Science is like its own world, and only scientists can explain it well. If you do not know the rules of this world, it is hard to write about it. Gould believes you should not make things too simple for the reader. You can use simple words, but you should not change the main ideas. If readers feel you are treating them like they do not understand, they will not like your writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in London, the air is very cold. The gym uses a lot of air-conditioning because of the hot summer. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic inside. This is an example of how people use too much air-conditioning. Many buildings could stay cool in other ways. They could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls to keep heat out. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun. A long time ago, they were very important for keeping time. But when clocks and watches got better, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are interested in them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, says they connect us to the planets. When a sundial starts working, it feels magical. They are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I once saw older women painting china cups with flowers. They were very good at it, and their hands were steady. I wondered who would take a china-painting class. Would they be as good? The class was not scary. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint quickly like I remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price. They would fly from Gatwick Airport and stay twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency, the clerk said other people on the trip were students learning Italian. But something went wrong. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
When they arrived, a woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on."" Keith thought it was an overnight stop. It was late, and they were tired, so they went to bed. The next morning, they realized they were staying there for the whole holiday. The receptionist said they could enjoy the lake and take a boat to Interlaken.
Keith told the receptionist there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said their group was booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, came over. She explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels.
Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she would check and left. Keith thought about what happened at the airport. An old man named Nottage talked to them. He and his wife enjoyed their sleep because of the fresh air.
Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They realized it was ironic. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they ended up with a group of elderly people. They wanted to escape the needs of the elderly, just like Uncle had said."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American business leaders are learning from the explorer Ernest Shackleton. Eluned Price reports. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. In America, he is becoming popular now. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton 'an Antarctic explorer whose achievements were mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century.' But now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being written and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is having a big exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a movie about Shackleton's life. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with admiration and learn lessons in leadership and communication from him. Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, is now a model for modern managers. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has used Shackleton as a role model for years. His company deals with communication during company problems. For example, when a company's factory has an accident or when many workers lose their jobs. Shackleton worked in public relations for a Glasgow steel company, so he understood communication. MacGregor says, 'Even if a company handles its problems well, it can still cause harm by not communicating well.' Shackleton is a model for management because he was a good leader and communicator. He made important decisions, like turning back 97 miles from the South Pole to save his men's lives. In a crisis, people want to know someone is in charge. Shackleton was always ready to take responsibility. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and then crushed. Shackleton told his men, 'We will all be safe if you trust me and do your best.' Shackleton planned everything, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and ready to start again if needed. Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor says, 'In difficult times, doing nothing can be hard, especially in America, where people want quick solutions.' Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he gave his gloves to a photographer who had none. He also shared a biscuit when they were starving. Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, says, 'People want heroes. Shackleton shows us true heroism, which we miss today.'"
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insect larvae in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its teeth to make holes and its long, thin middle finger to find and scoop the insects. Scientists have studied how the aye-aye finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied two male aye-ayes, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to know if they find insects by looking for signs on the wood. He gave them logs with holes. Some holes had mealworms, and some did not. The aye-ayes went to the holes with food without needing to see signs. They did not use smell or sound to find the insects. They even found dead mealworms that made no noise. Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes can sense empty spaces in the wood. They tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their big ears. They might hear echoes or feel vibrations that show a hollow space. The aye-aye might also hear insects move when it taps. The idea that the aye-aye is like a woodpecker in Madagascar is interesting. But there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker, a bat, and a squirrel. Its teeth grow like a squirrel's, and it can open nuts with its finger.'"
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like when they were young? Diaries and family stories give us only small pieces of their past. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often want to write things down but never do it. We might leave videos, but they are still just images. Hannah Renier has an idea: she writes autobiographies for other people. She makes a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary people. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family and saw how much of the past was disappearing. ""At first, I didn't take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people with interesting lives. They do it for their children or the future, but they also enjoy it."" People feel safe to be honest with her. A 62-year-old man shared his life story, including painful parts like his divorce. ""I did it for my family, so they might learn something,"" he says. ""But I haven't let my children read it yet. Maybe after I'm gone."" He saw patterns from his childhood in his life. Hannah noticed this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""They follow their parents' wishes or rebel against them."" People often talk about old disappointments. Even after many years, they still feel upset about things with their parents. Hannah listens and writes their stories. ""It's not for the public,"" she says.

CAE_24,C1,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**
The Museum of Classical Archaeology has many copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over six hundred works. Remember, nothing here is real. All the sculptures are copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with good natural light. The plaster casts have many advantages: sculptures that were originally together but are now in different museums in Europe can be seen together here. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.
**B. Cambridge Darkroom**
Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography. It has community darkrooms and a gallery with different photography exhibitions. We have courses and workshops for all ages and skills, like our Beginner's Course, a short Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. Members can use our darkrooms. We also help young photographers (aged 12 to 16) with our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We sell photographic books, magazines, and materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**
The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all over the world. It also has Britain's oldest geological collection, from Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare specimens in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and added a lot to the collections. The collection is arranged by geological age, showing changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery has beautiful minerals and gems. The displays have labels to explain their nature and modern use.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**
There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos throughout Great Britain. The photos show the landscape and human activity from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. The photos cannot be borrowed, but copies can be bought. These take about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is one of the oldest and longest-running centers in the world. It is a unique tourist attraction. You can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred brass plates from tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center makes resin copies, called facsimiles, to preserve the originals and make brass rubbing available to everyone. The brass plates were a way to remember people and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Most of the original brasses were destroyed, but many are still in Britain, and the Cambridge Centre has a wide range of examples."

**A. The Theatre Director**
I have had small children for 35 years because of my unusual personal life. I love being a father. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I am lucky because my children and I love the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This makes us close, especially now that they are older. I try to be there for them if they need me, but I wait for them to call me. I don't want to make them feel guilty by asking why they haven't called. My parents did that to me, and I don't want to do it to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**
I was about 25 when my children were born. It was hard to handle the responsibilities, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new music, clothes, and youth culture. This helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young because I was busy with work, but now I can take them on nice holidays. They like coming to parties and events with us. They think my job is interesting.
**C. The Politician**
My first child was born when I was starting my political career. My wife and I wanted to spend time with our children, but my work made it hard. I try to take them with me to weekend meetings and events. This way, they know what I do, and they don't feel like I am gone. More politicians are bringing their kids to work now. We all want to include our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**
My first marriage ended when my children, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I tried hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, but it was confusing for the kids. Kate says I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I treated them like adults too soon. Kate thinks we were too easygoing. I wish I had been more organized. I still worry about my children, even the older ones.
**E. The TV Presenter**
I was ready to have kids when I turned 30. My wife and I had a nice house, so we decided to have a child instead of buying more things. Having my daughter Betty made me think about who I am. Being a parent is special, but it also makes you like other parents. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at Betty's smile makes everything better. A baby's smile can make anyone happy."

CAE_46,C1,"'Science in the Air Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, it looked like a normal airplane. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135, made in 1964, based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was different. The 13 students from Europe and America were ready for an exciting flight. Inside, it was a long white tunnel with few windows and lights on the walls. Most seats were gone, except a few at the back. The students sat there, looking nervous. For a year, they competed with other students to join this flight. The European Space Agency asked for creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, like a roller-coaster ride. For two hours, the Boeing would fly up and down like a big bird. At the top of each curve, the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters. The plane went higher by itself before falling back to Earth. In those few seconds, everything inside became weightless, and the students felt like they were closer to the moon. The plane took off smoothly, but soon it climbed at a 45-degree angle for 20 seconds. The engines were loud, and we felt the blood leave our heads. Then the engines stopped, and we were weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence. The floor felt like a trampoline, and one step sent us to the ceiling. We floated without direction. After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane up. Gravity returned, and some students landed hard. There were 30 curves in total, giving ten minutes for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. They used a device to turn it over in the air. A German team looked at how metal joins in space, thinking about future space stations. Students from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films. They believe these sails could use the sun's rays like a yacht uses the wind. After two hours, we felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. 'It was unforgettable,' said one student. 'I want to be an astronaut even more now.''"
CAE_3,C1,"**My Time in New Zealand**
I had a special time in my life when I didn't have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer from here, which is winter in New Zealand. So, I had nine winters in a row. I like winter, so it was great. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land in New Zealand. My brother, sister, and I could take care of it. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, we would always have a connection to New Zealand. My father grew up there, so it was a nice idea.
They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland, in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was okay for planting trees. I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on farms, so planting trees sounded nice to me. I started planting in 1968, and by 1972, we planted all 70 acres.
In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand. It was a happy time, even though it rained almost every day. I was often wet and cold. Every morning, I got ready to plant more trees. I had a helper who knew how to plant trees, which was good because I was new to it. We used a planting bag to carry the trees. It was hard work, but I enjoyed it. We had to plant the trees in straight lines, which was tricky. Once you get used to it, planting becomes easier.
While planting, I thought a lot about life and nature. These thoughts have stayed with me. I have visited New Zealand four times since then to see the trees grow. It makes me happy to see them doing well. I worry when I read about bad weather in New Zealand, but the trees are now 20 years old and healthy.
In 1984, I took time off from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" there. I stayed in a small cabin with just a bed, table, and chair. I wrote in the mornings, pruned trees in the afternoons, and did research in the evenings. I still feel a strong connection to that place. It is where I feel most connected to the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Bringing Up Badgers**
""What now?"" I thought when a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset. We are known for taking care of orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange, like a mix of a cackle and a bark. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky-colored eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between January and March and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die of hunger.
These cubs were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. The mother was dead, and the babies were still with her. They were healthy but cold and crying. I cleaned them and put them by the stove in the kitchen to warm up. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe and wiped them with a warm cloth to help them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they ate every four hours. Soon, they started drinking from a bottle and moving around a bit.
Three weeks later, Willow seemed tired but was still eating. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, or liquid can go into the lungs. This happened to Willow, and he got an infection.
I was sad but continued to care for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, also named Willow. He was found alone and cold. Willow II was hard to feed. I had to move the bottle around in his mouth to get him to drink. By the end of April, the females were eating solid food, but Willow II was still learning. He finally started eating sausages.
At five months old, they all ate cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were lucky because the summer was hot, and finding earthworms was hard.
By August, the cubs became more active at night. We often walked through the orchard, and they played and chased each other. Derek sometimes joined us but often got nipped by the playful cubs. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. Badgers are territorial and can be aggressive to outsiders. We were warned they might harm our cubs, so we made their pen secure.
The local press took pictures of me with the badgers, and we started a project to build a home for them on the farm. With help, we designed a sett with tunnels and chambers. Our son Daniel made the plans. The cost was high, but a local bus company and other businesses helped. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home.
One evening, the badgers moved into their new home. I checked on them later and saw them sleeping peacefully. Now, I don't walk with them as often because they are active late at night. We see Primrose sometimes, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before going off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy here."
CAE_67,C1,"'Finding True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass changes. Anjana Ahuja reports. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But he also did important work on compass variations, now called 'declination'. Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors could not correct their compasses and find their way at sea. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the Atlantic Ocean. The first trip stopped early because of problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, Halley published a map showing compass variations in the oceans. This map helped sailors for over a hundred years until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate. Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, a famous explorer, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. 'Halley was an amazing person,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. He even helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.' Dr. Clark's trip, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. He will make the same measurements as Halley, but with better tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the model of Earth's magnetic field. 'We usually measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. To measure direction, you need to know true north,' says Dr. Clark. 'We can use satellites to find true north on our trip.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements around the world. Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the Atlantic Ocean. Halley's journey was the first scientific sea expedition, and he was the first civilian naval captain for this purpose. Is Dr. Clark ready for his journey? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked with the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the trip in four parts, with different crews. Does he share Halley's passion? 'I am ready to spend eight months on this, so maybe some people think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't sail across the Atlantic without a good reason. Halley and his life give me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,C1,"**Peacocks and Their Beautiful Tails**
Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peacocks, called hens. This display is a mystery that puzzled Charles Darwin. In nature, animals usually need to be strong and fast to survive. So, why do peacocks have such big, fancy tails?
Darwin thought animals change over time through evolution. The strongest and smartest animals survive and have babies. But peacocks have big tails that seem to make life harder. Darwin suggested another idea called ""sexual selection."" He thought females liked beauty, so they chose males with beautiful tails.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He believed that if hens chose peacocks with fancy tails, those peacocks must have other good qualities. The tail was like an advertisement for these qualities.
Today, scientists like Marion Petrie study peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers. They want to know if hens really choose males with the best tails and if these males have other good qualities. Observations show that hens like peacocks with many eye-spots on their tails. These peacocks get more mates.
Some scientists think that showy male birds are healthier and have fewer parasites. But this is hard to test in peacocks. Dr. Petrie is studying if the children of attractive peacocks are healthier and grow faster.
There is another idea called ""Fisher's Runaway."" It suggests that if a female picks a male with a slightly better tail, their children will inherit these traits. Over time, this can lead to very fancy tails, supporting Darwin's idea of ""beauty for beauty's sake."""
CAE_66,C1,"'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS The best boat design should mix old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. He did this with his boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London has many new yachts with the latest technology. Most of these boats are from a design change that happened 25 years ago. My boat is different. It is on a quiet creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic person. Maybe I am, but I think my boat is better because it uses both old and new ideas. Modern technology is important for building boats today, but sometimes it makes sailing too easy. Sailors want to feel the real experience of being at sea. I think boats should have some comforts, like a warm stove and a good bed. But if everything on the boat is automatic, it takes away the fun of sailing. For example, steering should be at the back of the boat, not in the middle, just to make more space inside. A boat should feel like a boat, not a house. My old boat, Hirta, had comforts but no luxury. It had heavy sails and no modern equipment, but it was the best boat I ever sailed. Old boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I could not find a new boat I liked, so I decided to build one. The Westerman was designed by Nigel Irens and Ed Burnett. They used both hand drawings and computers to design it. The boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won races. It looks timeless and is very comfortable. It was designed as a sailing boat first, not as a place to live. It shows that you do not need to follow new trends to be happy. The boat is made of wood with special glue, so it does not let water in. It has the good things of a modern boat but looks and feels like a classic one.'"

CAE_22,C1,"'NATURAL TALENTS In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't changed much: we are still more than 98% the same as chimps. On this big evolutionary scale, what makes humans different from animals is very recent. Our history shows that our ability to make art and other human things must come from a small part of our genes. This is a big job for just a few genes. So, it's not surprising that studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are also in animals. For example, not only humans use tools; wild chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have a simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings show that there are few absolute differences, other than art, between us and animals. But if human art came from a special genetic gift, it's strange that our ancestors didn't use it for most of the 7 million years since they split from chimps. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we wouldn't know because those materials don't last. We only have clear evidence of human art from the Cro-Magnons, about 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments. If we say our recent creativity sets us apart, how is our art different from similar animal works? Three differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it's made for beauty, and it's learned, not genetic. Let's look at these ideas. First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless"". This means human art doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike most animal behaviors. Human art is different because it communicates thoughts or feelings, not genes. Birdsong, for example, helps defend a territory or attract a mate, passing on genes. The second idea is that only human art is made for beauty. We can't ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they sing mainly during breeding season, so they probably don't sing just for beauty. Again, human art seems unique. The third idea is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds inherit their songs and would sing them even if they never heard them. It's like a French baby raised in Japan singing the French national anthem without learning it. Human art changes quickly. Geese honked 2,000 years ago, as they do today, but human art changes so fast that even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often tell when and who painted a work. But they might mistake two mid-20th-century artists, Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and most of their paintings sold. These paintings by chimps blur some lines between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings were not made for practical reasons but for the painter's satisfaction. You might say human art is different because artists want to communicate. The apes didn't care about communicating and just discarded their paintings. But this isn't a big problem, as some human art that became famous was also made for the artist's own satisfaction.'"
CAE_39,C1,"'A Big Adventure The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance. Today, you don't find such people in stories or real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore. Blackmore's big adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home. The team had four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous. This group started to cross 1,200 kilometers of desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a book about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He started the expedition for fun and to learn more about himself. 'I always thought I would stay in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I wanted to see who I really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was worried because nobody had done that route before. We went into it without knowing what to expect. It took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was kind to us.' When you read his story, you might wonder why he says 'kind'. The team faced many problems: illness, hot and cold temperatures, thirst, and losing some of their water. 'But', Blackmore says, 'when we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some. We didn't have the desert's big sandstorms. And we didn't face the very cold weather that could stop us. But we had many problems. The sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the camels, which often fell over. 'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. No planes flew over us. Once we were in the desert, we were alone. 'I knew I was mentally strong, but I was scared about my physical strength. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" I was very scared.' How did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked 1,000 kilometers, you don't give up. We were very thin but strong. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.' In the book, Blackmore talks about lying in the desert looking at the moon and thinking of his family. How did he feel about their worry? 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace. When I doubt myself, I think of the desert and how we did it. I am proud of that expedition. But for a lifetime achievement, I think of my family and our happiness. The desert does not compare.' Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I want the challenge and open spaces. We had a purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of modern life.''"
CAE_18,C1,"Susan Harr is tired of technology. She turns off her gadgets and enjoys doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it makes life easier. But Susan thinks we depend too much on it. She had a problem with her word processor, which was expensive to fix. This made her think that gadgets might not be worth the trouble. Susan is letting her old gadgets stop working and not replacing them. She wonders if technology really gives us more time or just makes us buy more gadgets. 
When her sewing machine broke, she decided to sew by hand. She likes that she can take her sewing anywhere and doesn't have to listen to a noisy machine. She also got rid of her color TV and now watches a small black-and-white one. This makes her think more about what she watches. Without the TV, she spends more time walking her dog, reading, and talking with family.
Susan enjoys sewing by hand. She can listen to the radio or talk with friends while she sews. She finds it relaxing and satisfying. She also likes washing dishes by hand because it gives her time to think. Now, she looks around her house and wonders if she really needs things like the freezer or microwave. She thinks she could save money by using fewer gadgets."
CAE_62,C1,"'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from making furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop in East London, and he greets me quickly, saying: 'Well, fire away then!' It is not clear if he is really in a hurry or just shy. But his workshop is very busy. There are many half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in different natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and is well-known. His order book is always full for months, even though he does not advertise. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the person to go to. Finding a furniture-maker is not hard. But finding one who makes beautiful furniture with simple lines is not easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says. He is not happy with some modern furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He does not like bad, mass-produced furniture. Hurst wants perfection and has talent. He is confident about his ability. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says. 'I have always been good at making things.' Hurst is self-taught. How did he learn? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says. Most of his work comes from private people. Some clients come back many times. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he admits that working with clients is not always easy. 'The most annoying clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favorite clients are the exacting ones.' Hurst is happy with his work but also praises others. 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (a top furniture design school). He is critical of craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also does not like degree shows where students try to make fashion statements. 'A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.' Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he says, 'After all, I am only making furniture.''"
CAE_49,C1,"'Why do we sleep? People sleep for about one-third of their lives. This means sleep is very important. But scientists do not agree on why we need sleep. There are three main ideas. The first idea says sleep is good for our body. When we sleep, our body fixes itself and gets ready for the next day. The second idea says sleep helps us learn. When we sleep, our brain works on the things we learned during the day. Without sleep, we cannot learn well. The third idea says sleep gives us energy. We sleep to get more energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"'ECCENTRICS An eccentric is a person who behaves differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own little habits. It could be entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the newspaper about many topics. Eccentricity is about being unique. Inside us, there are two forces. One is called individualism, and the other is conformity. Most people want to be accepted and loved, so they follow the crowd. But some people have unusual hobbies or strong opinions. They like to meet others who share their interests. They form clubs and hold meetings. They feel better when they are with others who understand them. We all feel a pull between being unique and fitting in. Sometimes, we want to show we are different. For example, a person might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me."" We can choose to be more individual. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, an American singer, said, ""When you feel what you are doing and keep doing it, you will surprise many people."" But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. A pop singer wearing strange clothes for attention is not eccentric. But if they always act this way and cannot go back to 'normal', they might be eccentric. Eccentrics do not try to be different; they just are. They do not care about what others think. They are not like enthusiasts, practical jokers, or exhibitionists, who are aware of society. Eccentrics live their lives without worrying about what others think.'"
CAE_58,C1,"'Natural Books We asked four nature experts to tell us about the wildlife book that influenced them the most. A Geoffrey Lean Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small, frail woman who was very important in environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences into a strong philosophy. As a young journalist, she helped me understand the field. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But The Home of Man is, to me, her most important book. It talks about the fast growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a strong call for what we now call 'sustainable human development'. I have read many books since, but none match it. B Linda Bennett When I read Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a herring gull colony. This book explains animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony becomes a lesson in social structure. You can see which birds are partners and where the boundaries are. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviourist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with Eric Ennion, a talented wildlife artist, to create this book. Ennion's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and another is peaceful. This is the work of a true field naturalist. C Lee Durrell My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that influenced me the most. It led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation. This book made me love the natural world. I was in Madagascar studying animal sounds when I first read it. I was having a hard time, but reading this book made me happy. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty together. Many people say humans are the worst because of the harm we do, but Gerald saw the world as a family. This is an idea we all need to understand. D Bruce Pearson I found The Shell Bird Book by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. I loved the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and spent holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to start sketching birds. The Shell Bird Book had more to offer. It had chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and birds in music, literature, and art. This book showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was as important as a scientific one. Since I was better at art than maths or physics, it opened a new path for me.'"
CAE_37,C1,"'DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five important British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are very important for publishers. The Book Marketing Council found that many people buy books because of reviews, more than for other reasons like ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers feel sad if there are no reviews, but publishers are less upset by bad reviews. They think any review can help sell books because people want to decide for themselves. Publishers like reviews that agree with their own opinion of the book. Publisher B Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are often ignored. Publishers need reviews because they help make books and authors known. A good review by a trusted person can help sell books. Publisher C Reviews are very important for literary publishers. They help sell books, especially for authors who are not famous. Good reviews are better than ads because they are honest. Reviews can help a book become popular, but they need help from other things like word of mouth and good marketing. Publisher D In Britain, the link between publishing and reviews is unclear. In the US, a review in the New York Times can make a book popular. In Britain, it can take many years for good reviews to help a writer. Some books sell well even with bad or no reviews. Non-fiction reviews often talk more about the subject than the book. Publisher E Publishers and writers want long, good reviews. But do they sell books? I published a biography with great reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they knew the book from the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more. Now, a surprising reviewer or a strong, funny, or original review can make people want to buy the book.'"
CAE_2,C1,"'WEATHERVANE MAKER Making weathervanes is a very old skill. It started in early Egyptian times. Today, Graham Smith keeps this craft alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham makes special designs for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.' This is different from the usual cockerel design. Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick, not a cockerel. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I saw that I could make many different designs,' he says. Graham decided to start a weathervane business. He was a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed roles. She worked as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job was not artistic, but this is fun and creative,' he says. 'I love designing.' Graham has made over 100 original designs. He works with fine details and always asks the customer to approve the design before cutting it by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs because they are popular. 'People like hand-made things,' Graham says. 'They want something a little different.' Graham does not want to expand his business. He wants to keep it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique designs, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost real,' he says. 'For a long time, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction changes,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want a special touch for their homes. This helps crafts like mine.' Graham is very busy now, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients around the world. American and Danish buyers are especially interested. 'The price,' he says, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can make a special gift.'"
CAE_68,C1,"'Beginner Takes All Before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was already a very popular book. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans. He talks about his inspiration and success. At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans. He is a screenwriter and producer. A film he was working on, Life and Limb, was canceled suddenly. He was worried because he had not earned money for two years. The film was his only hope to pay the bank. Instead of finding a job, Evans decided to go to America for three months to write his first novel. He got the idea for the story from a farrier he met in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a horse that became wild. A gypsy, known as a 'horse whisperer', calmed the horse by talking to it. Evans was interested in this story. He wanted to write a screenplay, but after Life and Limb was canceled, he decided to write a book. He traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses. He felt alone and worried about his future. By August, he had written half of the book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was good and said Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts. In October, the first part of the book and a summary were sent to publishers. Soon, his agent told him that someone offered $75,000 for the book. Evans was surprised. In a week, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. This was a record for a first novel. Hollywood studios also wanted to make a movie. Evans decided not to write the screenplay for the movie. He wanted to stay involved but not too closely. The success of his book also brought new interest in Life and Limb, but Evans was not sure if he wanted to make it. He thought it would be better to write another novel.'"
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Chess Players Bobby Fischer is trying to play chess again, but he is older now. Chess is a game for young people. After 20 years away, Bobby Fischer is playing against Boris Spassky. Bobby won the first game, but he is not the same as in 1972. He is 49 years old and not in practice. Boris Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in 20 years. Now, chess is more about winning than about art or science. Players need strong nerves and stamina. The games are longer, and there are no breaks. Young players have an advantage. In the last 30 years, each new world champion is younger. Eight of the top ten players in the world are under 30. Chess is also different because of computers. Players use computers to study their opponents' games. A small computer can have one million chess games. Being ready for the start of the game is very important. There are many good players now. They play for small prize money. A game can last up to eight hours. Players must focus all the time. A mistake can mean losing the game. The chess clock makes the game more tense. At the end of the game, players have only seconds to make moves. They must be fast and focused. Winning feels great, but losing is very hard. Chess tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day. World championship matches are even harder. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov stopped because they were too tired. Karpov lost about 10kg. Can Bobby Fischer win again? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" He left chess in 1972, which was surprising. If he came back for money, he will earn a lot. But if he wants to be the best again, it might be very difficult.'"
CAE_60,C1,"**Fame and Success**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A. Nick Grosso**
Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's a low-budget film, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know it's difficult. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing school, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational place. It was exciting.""
**B. Simon Pegg**
Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and just finished a tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at university, he performed in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor. I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but working with Steve Coogan has been the best. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.
**C. Ciaran McMenamin**
Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show was very successful, and his career took off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""Now I can choose what I do, which is what I always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always talented. Encouraged by his mother, he played lead roles at school and joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he waits for praise but says, ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the fame, but you realize it's not about that. It's about respect for good work.""
**D. Neil Taylor**
Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company talks about a big hit, but I don't know. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and tried to enter the music business. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix."" It was perfect timing. ""I was often depressed and in bad bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E. Stephen Richards**
Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many prizes and awards. He is well-known in the poetry world and has been touring and reading his work for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that couldn't be a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but later became bored with education. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with a job at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published a children's book in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because I read a lot as a child."" With his poetry being praised, moving to novels is brave. ""There's a structure in poetry, so less can go wrong,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for mistakes. My goal is not to write without caring about quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"A. Isabel is an art student who is 31 years old. She likes historical romance stories and is looking for Mr. Right. She thinks she looks good in jeans but doesn't wear them often because she doesn't want to meet the wrong people. Isabel worries about her knees, but she always has hope. This hope helps her and others in the story. The book is written in a fun and exciting way, like an old silent movie.
B. This story is about a local radio station in America. A smart child named Francis With works for WLT Radio, which was started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays music, shows, and more. The story is set in a small American town and takes the reader back to the 1940s and 1950s. The author uses humor and simple writing to tell the story.
C. In this story, a professor named Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poetess. He talks about it with his wife's first husband. The poetess writes bad poetry and wants Richard to help her brother, who is in prison. The author makes the story interesting by solving these problems in a funny and smart way. The book is enjoyable and clever.
D. Two women and two men become best friends in London during the 1960s. One of them, James Hudson, starts a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. They both loved a woman who died years ago. The story is about murder, ambition, love, and jealousy. The book is long, so readers can really get to know the characters.
E. This story is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about something he did. To make up for it, he takes care of his brother's three children. Ian is 40 years old and lives alone. The story shows his special relationship with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and funny book with the right mix of sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work.
**A.** Volunteer tourists often help build homes or schools. They pay a lot of money to do this work. If they gave this money directly to the local community, it could pay for more work than one volunteer can do. This is true for gap year volunteers, who usually do not have special skills. Some studies question if gap year volunteering is really to help others or to improve the volunteer's career. However, these projects can help volunteers learn to act kindly in their future lives.
**B.** Volunteering can help people understand each other better and solve problems. It can also help people from different countries work together and make friends. This can be good for everyone. But if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, it might help them more than the communities they visit. These volunteers might use the experience to get ahead in their careers.
**C.** Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as charity from rich countries. It can also be a way for volunteers to improve their own skills. At its best, volunteering helps both the volunteers and the communities. It allows people to share skills and learn from each other. Volunteering can also make people aware of global problems like poverty and injustice.
**D.** Volunteer tourism is popular because people want to help others. It seems positive because it is not about big government or business. But it can also ignore the real needs of poor communities. Volunteering is a good act, but when it is called ""sustainable development,"" it can be misleading. It might not really help solve big problems like poverty."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**
Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need something to help us wake up. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios.
One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for workdays and one for weekends. But not everyone needs this. This model also has a cassette player, which is nice because you can listen to your own tapes. The radio quality is good, but the clock radio is big. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn't work.
Another model was the best-looking and the overall winner. Paul Bridges liked it a lot, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 16:00. The digital display is nice, and the snooze bar is easy to use. It has a self-power back-up, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out. But it was hard to set up. Tom Granger said the model with a built-in lamp was 'tacky'. The lamp was hard to use, and the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer was very loud, like a submarine alarm. This model is popular with young people because of its bright colors.
One model was easy to set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges thought this was not good. The simplest and cheapest model was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which Tom Granger liked. He said it was more intuitive. The radio quality was fine, and the buzzer worked well."
CAE_50,C1,"'Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many places in the world, but not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are scared. This helps them because their spines point outwards. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They might try to run away from danger first and roll into a ball only if they have to. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year.'"
CAE_25,C1,"'Great Sports Women Winning in Sports It is hard to be good at sports, even for men, but women have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they have to give up many things. But they are winning and breaking records. Here, we talk to some great British sportswomen who are reaching their goals. A. Jill, 27, skier ""It's amazing to fly through the air and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes you feel sick or it's windy and hard to see, but you keep going. It's hard to have a job outside skiing because we train for ten months a year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated the same - it's a young sport."" B. Caroline, 22, cyclist ""Two years ago I borrowed a bike for a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I had never cycled before! I get good money as a pro, and cycling has many chances for sponsorship. But I worry people think I succeed because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I focus on cycling now, not on earning money. I train at least four hours every day on the bike, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is a cyclist too, so he understands the time you need to put into it -- it would be impossible otherwise."" C. Annabel, 26, rower ""Rowing is hard for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. So most start at 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches usually stay only a year. There's no continuity, so the women's team is not well organized. But it's fun and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life."" D. Ffyona, 24, long-distance walker ""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know how big it was then! Britain felt too small and safe. I was very strong-willed; I hated anyone controlling me. Now I am more careful. Each walk is different. The walk across Australia was the hardest because of pain. I walked 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours of sleep in high temperatures and 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is seen as a higher risk."" E. Lisa, 26, car racer ""Some men have big egos when driving - you see it on highways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages. When I get to a corner, men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of bumps! You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very hard to earn money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been seen as unusual. It's great that more women are racing every year. For me, the appeal of car racing is aiming for perfection, always trying to get a perfect lap."" F. Alison, 28, triathlete ""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up before a race and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm lazy at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I'd really be lazy, c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together but when an event is in the news, 90 percent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 percent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it.""'"
CAE_34,C1,"**The Day I Met Picasso**
Richard Cork remembers the day he met the famous artist, Picasso. Richard was 18 years old and traveling around Europe and Morocco before starting university. He had little money, so he worked painting boats in Cannes. One day, he saw Picasso having lunch at a restaurant with his wife and friends. Richard was surprised because Picasso was usually a private person.
Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard approached Picasso and offered his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed his name and drew a little picture on the page. Richard was very happy and started a conversation with Picasso, even though they needed help from an American woman to translate.
Richard's friend suggested he draw Picasso's portrait. Richard returned to Picasso's table and began to draw him. Picasso made funny faces to make it difficult for Richard, but eventually, he sat still. Richard noticed how young and strong Picasso looked, even though he was almost 84 years old.
After Richard finished the portrait, Picasso wanted to see it. Richard was shy but showed it to him. Picasso then drew a quick picture on the same page, adding a playful touch to Richard's work. Richard asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso said he had already signed once.
Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It was a special moment for him."
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:
**A. Fresh Look**
Supermarkets know people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance. They might also have a bakery with the smell of fresh bread. The store might use green colors because it reminds people of fresh things. Most of what they sell, like frozen foods, is not fresh.
**B. Smart Display**
Where products are placed in a store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to know where people shop the most. They put expensive or fast-selling items there. Shelves at eye level are popular because people see them first. Special offers in big bins attract people who love bargains. Stores also put items that go well together, like salad dressings near salads.
**C. Staples Spread Out**
Supermarkets put basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, you pass by other tempting products. Stores also put popular items far away so you see other things while looking for them.
**D. Less is More**
Some stores, like Next, show fewer items to make them look special. This makes people think the clothes are unique, even if they are not. The store design helps sell the clothes.
**E. Total Temptation**
People care more about the total bill than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers. They buy in large amounts to get discounts from manufacturers.
**F. Price Tricks**
In chain stores, people notice individual prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference. It also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up the sale to give change.
**G. Lighting Magic**
Stores use special lighting. Chain stores want natural light so clothes look the same outside. Supermarkets use lighting to make fruits and vegetables look better.
**H. Walking Paths**
Stores use different carpets to guide you. One type is for walking paths, and another is for sales areas. Some stores use wood or marble for paths to make the carpeted sales areas more inviting.
**I. In-Store Ads**
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use video screens on shopping carts. These screens show ads for products as you shop. They are for people who buy on impulse and can increase sales by 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"'Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also made new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written books like Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard. Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about it in their book: Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979, Chris was working on Quest for Adventure, a book about adventure after the war. He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to sail. Chris could teach Robin climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat, and Chris and Robin went to the shore to climb. The climb was hard, but Robin was calm. Chris asked Robin if he had climbed before. Robin hadn't, so Chris showed him how. Robin wanted to go down the way he did on his boat, using his arms. Chris wanted him to use his legs, but Robin went down safely. During the trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they use their skills together on a trip to Greenland. Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone for their opinion before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring and hard. He liked being on land more. Robin liked fixing things on the boat. Chris felt a bit useless sometimes. The yacht was small, with six people on it. When they got to Greenland, Chris led the climbing. He was worried about Robin's safety. Climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, was hard. Robin was not a natural climber, but he did well. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours. They were very tired and had to turn back. Robin trusted Chris and followed him. Robin was also worried about the boat. On the way home, there was a small problem. Chris was supposed to be on watch at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him. Chris thought Robin didn't trust him, but Robin explained it was not true. They became closer after the Greenland trip. Chris found out that Robin was a kind and sensitive person.'"
CAE_8,C1,"**A Simple History of the Apple**
**Early Apples**
People have eaten apples for a very long time. In ancient times, people in Britain and around Swiss and Italian lakes ate wild apples. These apples were small and not like the apples we eat today. In Switzerland, people even kept apple halves for winter.
**Apples in Britain**
Around 1000 AD, the French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. British monks then created new types of apples. One famous apple from 1200 was the Old English Pearmain. It was a dessert apple. Another was the Costard, used for cooking. But, because of problems like droughts and wars, fewer apples were grown, and more were imported. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apples. Harris brought back many apple plants and started a big orchard in Kent.
**Apples Around the World**
By the 1700s, apples were very popular in Britain. People took apples with them when they moved to places like Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. In America, a man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees.
**Famous Apples**
In 1850, a farmer in Iowa found a new apple and called it 'Delicious'. It became very popular. In Australia, Maria Anne Smith found a new green apple in 1868. It became known as the 'Granny Smith' apple.
**Modern Apples**
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from just a few types. These apples are chosen because they look good and travel well, not always because they taste the best. People now want more different kinds of apples. We need to protect the variety of apples for the future."

CAE_30,C1,"'Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the top 10,000-metre runners. Richard visits a training camp in Kenya. The camp is ten miles south of the equator, near Mount Kenya. This place is called Nanyuki. Richard has been coming here for three years to train in the winter. But he never trained with Kenyan runners before. On his fourth trip, he decided to change that. He ran his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This is where the best Kenyan runners train for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. Richard was invited by the Kenyan coach after he finished fifth in a big race. Training at high altitude helps runners because it makes more red blood cells. This helps carry more oxygen. Kenyan runners have been very successful because of this. Richard's first race in Africa was in Nairobi. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa. Many Kenyan runners finished before him, but he still felt he did well. Richard thinks Kenyan success is not just because of altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple way of running and living. They enjoy competing. Richard wanted to know how they train. At the camp, he found out. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. It is basic, with few comforts. Athletes live with students and share rooms. They train three times a day: a morning run, interval training, and an afternoon run. They run about 40 kilometres each day. On Sundays, they run 20 kilometres. Life at the camp is simple. Breakfast is tea, bread, and eggs. Lunch and dinner are ugali, stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya. Richard learned that Kenyan success is not just about genetics or altitude. It is also about their simple lifestyle and hard work. This might be why they are so good at running.'"
CAE_7,C1,"'Advertising Problems
Advertising is not doing well. This is not only because of the recession. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the recession. The problem is bigger and affects the whole world. Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now markets are smaller. Big brands should focus on smaller groups, but they often do not. This is a big mistake in advertising.
Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. In a year, you might buy a few hundred brands. For big items like cars, you might buy one every three years. You do not buy many clothes, and most are not advertised brands. Even with other things like candy, medicine, and services, you probably do not buy more than 400 different brands a year.
There are 32,500 advertised brands, but most people buy only 400 of them. This means 96% of advertising is wasted. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it is about 1 in 16 ads. This means 94% of ads are wasted. People think they are not affected by ads, but this is not true. Most people do not buy the brands they see advertised.
Advertising has to reach many people to find the right buyers. It is a cheap way to talk to many people. But, all advertising has waste. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste, but they can never know exactly who will buy. Even the best direct mail does not get a 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesman might sell to everyone he talks to. If advertisers knew who would buy, they would not need media.
If an advertiser gets one million new customers, it is very good. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million new customers. Any campaign that gets 2% of the population is very successful. This is a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message better.'"
CAE_43,C1,"'Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home. Southwell in Nottinghamshire has surprises. The first is Southwell Minster, an old cathedral with 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen. The second is Britain's greenest house, the 'autonomous house', made by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their waste into garden compost, and heat their house with heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, plus that of their three children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay roof, and is 300 yards from the Minster. It matches the town's old buildings and was approved by planners even though it is in a protected area. The house is very quiet inside because it is super-insulated with special windows. Inside, you must take off your shoes. It is a sunny day, and the conservatory warms the air for the house. Vale opens windows to let air in because the house is very airtight. Even the cats have their own special door. The Vales, who teach architecture, cared about the environment before it was popular. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s. They designed a house with no carbon dioxide emissions and no mains water. They use composting toilets, rainwater tanks, and copper gutters to keep water clean. Water from washing goes into the garden. They don't use a dishwasher because they don't want to use strong detergents. The house is designed to be good for the environment without being dark or medieval. The only medieval part is the hall, which is tall. The Vales pay no water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. Soon, they will add solar panels to use even less electricity. The house will still use some electricity from the mains for cooking, but it will make extra electricity. There will be enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood stove, used only in the coldest winter. Is it warm in winter? One February night, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The room was 18C, which is comfortable because there are no draughts. In the past, people were comfortable at lower temperatures because of their clothing. The house is simple and low-tech, with few things to break. It was built cheaply, costing the same as low-cost housing. Commercial builders do not like this idea.'"
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man, like a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies in a garden, he believed they were real proof that fairies existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural things. In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They just cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them among flowers. The photos are very beautiful. But the simple trick shows that the camera can lie. Today, we use computer programs to change our digital photos, and it is not true that photography was ever completely honest. From the start, when cameras began taking pictures, those pictures were being changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"'Blacksmiths Iron has always been important to people, and blacksmiths, the people who work with iron, have been seen as more than just workers. Before machines were common, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The fancy metalwork in French and Belgian buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths. But by the late 1960s, there were very few blacksmiths left in Britain because big factories didn't need them anymore, and new buildings didn't use nice iron designs. In the last 10 years, there has been a new interest in blacksmiths because people like decorative buildings and new interior designs. However, many designs still look old-fashioned, like 'classical' or 'Victorian-style' gates and balconies. In design stores, you often see rusty candlesticks. Luckily, there are new ideas, and some events are happening to show blacksmiths' work. One event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says we might be starting a new Iron Age because people and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now. Power tools help blacksmiths work more easily, allowing them to bend and shape metal. Dawson says, 'These artists can now express themselves with metal.' About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most money goes to the makers, but some helps promote good ironwork. Dawson's pieces include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says his style is like drawing with metal. Many artists love working with iron. Susan May, a jeweler, says it's magical because it's soft when hot but hard when cold. Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles inspired by castles in horror films. She likes that steel feels permanent. Iron gives people visual pleasure and a feeling of safety. It will likely be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks.'"
CAE_14,C1,"'THE DAY I STOPPED SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my colleagues was very angry. 'What do you mean?' she shouted. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I couldn't explain how one afternoon I was a heavy smoker, and four hours later I was not. It was strange to me too. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who wanted me to stop smoking. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and I got over colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives. On that normal Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to stop. 'I won't try to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I said. 'I'm here to write, not to stop, so it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me.' I enjoyed smoking. It made me happy. The counsellor looked at me like he knew something. We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. I think the stop-smoking messages made sense. Just like smoking was a challenge because people didn't like it, stopping started to feel interesting. The idea of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a secret feeling just for me. Could I also do other big things? In many ways, it was easy. The craving for nicotine, like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. The one thing I thought would be hard without cigarettes, my work, was not a problem. I thought I couldn't work without smoking, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, being at home on weekend mornings was the hardest, and it still is. I think smoking was something I did when I was bored. Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is different - eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, a theatre break. These are times when I used to smoke.'"
CAE_63,C1,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. Georgina Ferry, who is writing a book about Hodgkin, thinks she should be famous. Hodgkin was a great scientist and a special person. She lived through important changes in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and science becoming more global. 
When Ferry started her research, she wanted to read about other scientists. She looked for a book about Linus Pauling, a friend of Hodgkin who also won Nobel prizes. But she could not find any books about him in her local bookshop. This made her realize that people do not find scientists' lives interesting enough to write about. Some scientists, like Peter Medawar, even said that scientists' lives are boring. This idea makes it hard for publishers to sell books about scientists.
Many people think that scientists' lives are not as interesting as those of artists or politicians. Some scientists do not like to be in the media because they do not want to seem like they are promoting themselves. But this can make science seem less interesting to young people. 
Now, more scientists are appearing in public. For example, Richard Dawkins and Steve Jones are seen on TV. This helps people see scientists as real people. Books about scientists are also changing. They used to be very serious and only about work. Now, they include personal stories, like Richard Feynman's book, which is funny and interesting.
Dorothy Hodgkin was very dedicated to her work. She discovered the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel prize in 1964, and insulin in 1969. She also had a family with three children and a husband who was often away. Her personal life is not directly related to her work, but it shows how she balanced different parts of her life. Her story is interesting to everyone, not just because of her science. Understanding science is not harder than learning a new language; it just needs effort. It is important to know about scientists like Hodgkin, just as we know about famous writers and artists."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and her special skill
Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.
This skill is called dowsing. Dowsing is finding water, minerals, or lost things underground. Some people think it is a special sense. There are many ideas about how it works. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more. Dowsers, like Margaret, might feel these vibrations. Some say they can even smell water.
In recent years, there has been little rain, so Margaret has been very busy. She had a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. Some customers have holiday homes far from water pipes. Others are building golf courses. Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and not near any waste. The water is in rock cracks, and it is important to bring it up clean. Cornwall, where she works, has a lot of minerals, so she checks for iron in the water.
Electricity is needed to run the water pump, so the well should be near power supplies. After checking everything, Margaret starts looking for water. On big areas like golf courses, she uses a map and a pendulum. The pendulum swings over places with water. Then, she walks with her hazel stick to find the exact spot. She holds the stick and feels a strange sensation when she is over water. The stick moves up when water is below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If she and her husband do not agree on the spot, they keep looking.
Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition. Many people are interested in how she does it. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This means she understands the area in a special way. Her skill helps her family run their well-drilling business successfully."
CAE_36,C1,"'We changed lives for a day! Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to do something different? We made it happen for four people - read what happened. Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a busy London restaurant. A. Amanda's story I had never been in a place like it before. It was so dark and noisy - there were many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my home town, and I wasn't sure I would survive! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was getting it, the drinks fell off the tray and crashed on the floor. I was so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first! By opening time at 11.30 am, a line had already formed outside and I felt really nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but that wasn't a problem because everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt and I couldn't get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say 'Pardon?', which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day! I never knew how tiring waitressing would be. I thought it was a job for shy people, but you need to be friendly and calm with many customers! I'm quite shy and I don't think I could handle a busy Saturday night. I wasn't impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me! I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems easy after waitressing! B. Cindy's story I was nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I was told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. I was wrong! As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing. At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the sofa into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming loudly! I decided to let them play, thinking they'd get tired. Wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they beat me! After much persuasion, I got them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun started! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew it was just a trick so they could come downstairs and watch TV, but it was tiring to spend all evening making deals with them. I never knew how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the responsibility is huge. Even so, I really enjoyed the day. Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school. C. Rosemary's story On the farm, I get up at 5.30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a luxury! But I took a long time to decide what to wear. I couldn't wear overalls and boots, could I? Looking at about 400 pupils at assembly, I hoped I blended in and that my fresh face didn't make me stand out as being from the farm. After that, it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded by difficulty - very different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables together! Then I helped with a nature project - identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was fun because all the children wanted to practise on me, which showed my rusty French. Finally, we went to the school hall for Physical Education. I was tired by now, but the children seemed to have endless energy. The hardest part of the job was standing in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's scary. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming! D. Hilary's story I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep! As well as milk, she makes ice-cream, yoghurt, and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants, and tourist places. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into containers, squeezing ice-cream into cartons, and sticking on labels. It was hard to stop myself from tasting the goodies! At lunchtime, it was time to check the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and picked up a sheep that had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over, they could die, so they have to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year! I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't talk back! The worst part of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really hard to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.'"

His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. Bo saw Hakan's talent and helped him. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher. Bo was very passionate about the trumpet. Hakan learned to work with the trumpet's imperfections. He found his own sound early on. Unlike John Wallace, a British trumpet player who played in orchestras, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter, and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream. At 15, he needed to study more. America was too far, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud said playing in an orchestra is like digging in the garden. Hakan knew he was good, but at 17, he learned he could also connect with people through music. He entered a competition in Paris.

Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it works, it's amazing. From 10am to 1pm, I talk to patients about their surgeries. I like this and find it easy to talk to them. If they are upset, I try to comfort them, but I don't always have enough time. I leave work between 6pm and 8pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call and carry my pager. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about my patients, and I dream about surgery at night. I find it hard to relax."" B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER Name: Marita Age: 31 MARITA'S DAY ""I wake up at 7.45am, leave home by 8.20am, take the train, and arrive at work by 9.15am. On Monday at 10.30am, we have a meeting to talk about our work and any problems. We work in teams. My team has three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only ten to fifteen percent of the work is design; the rest is production. I get a brief from the client and spend three or four weeks designing and developing the project. Then I show my ideas to the client. If they agree, we plan the budget and hire photographers and illustrators. I talk to the printers and make sure everything is on time. I manage people and need to communicate well. When their work is ready, I send it to the printers. Managing many jobs can be stressful. Deadlines are always close, and no day is the same. Lunch is at 1pm for an hour. We try to go out, but sometimes I eat sandwiches and work. It's great when the client likes the designs, but disappointing if they don't. I get home at 7.30pm or later. It's hard to relax when I'm busy."" C. THE CHAUFFEUR Name: Linda Age: 42 LINDA'S DAY ""I wake up at 7am most days, but two or three times a week, I meet a flight and wake up between 4.30am and 5am. At 10.30 or 11am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Driving is a sitting job, so I watch my diet and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People ask me about restaurants and shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are booked in advance, so I can check routes. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are rude, but most are nice, and I have good relationships with regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. The press has tried to make me talk about clients, but I don't. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I try to sleep by 11pm."" D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER Name: Tracy Age: 27 TRACY'S DAY ""I wake up at 7am, leave home at 7.30am, and start work. My assistant and I maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial jobs, but mostly private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At 11am, we eat breakfast at a cafe. In summer, I work until 10pm; in winter, until 4.30pm. The office is at home, so I check messages and calls when I return. If someone wants a garden, I meet them in the evening. We use old materials to make gardens look old. Sometimes people have bad ideas, but it's satisfying to see a garden finished. It's hard to relax because I hear the business phone. I sleep well because the work is physical, and I'm tired. I'm not very strong, but I'm fit. It's a tough job, but it lets me be creative."" E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER Name: Zena Age: 27 ZENA'S DAY ""I arrive at the site by 8.30am. I'm an assistant engineer, looking after bridges and a wall that stops cars from driving into a quarry. I check that the contractors follow the plan and safety rules. I help solve problems. The contractors start at 6am, so I first check with the clerk of works about what happened since I left. The rest of the day depends on what he tells me. I look at paperwork or answer design questions. Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2pm and 2.30pm, but I eat as I go. When contractors eat, it's easier to check the site. We check their work, which can cause problems, so we need to be open with them. I see the main engineer once a day. If something important happens, I act before telling them. I leave the site at about 6pm and am always on call."""

I talk to current card users, find new ones, and work with partner companies. I start my day by organizing and checking emails. I handle advertising for the membership program, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10.00 am and check the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters, and invoices. The phone starts ringing at 10.30 am, and I have meetings about artists and projects. I listen to demo tapes carefully and decide if they fit our label. After signing a band, we work on their first album. I share my ideas with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets. I leave work at 7.00 pm and often go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. I might visit artists in the studio after a concert. I usually get home by 1.00 am and listen to music to relax.
**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8.00 am and arrive at work by 9.30 am. I check the mail and diary to see if we have clients visiting. I enjoy showing people our furniture and making sales. We sell antiques and buy from various places. Some items need fixing, so I work with restorers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette to stay updated and visit museums to compare furniture. I do the accounts monthly and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm and take about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work in shifts and leave home at 6.00 am for early shifts. I start at 7.00 am, taking over from the night shift. We work in teams to control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I read about new air traffic rules. It's important to be alert, so I take sick leave if needed. The job is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and maybe a general manager.
**E. Shop Manager**
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. I start by setting up the sales system and organizing staff breaks. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be tiring if they have many requests. From 2.00 pm to 4.00 pm, I meet with publishers' reps to discuss new books. I decide how many copies to order and ensure new titles arrive on time. The early shift ends at 5.45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the shop and going home.
**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then go to work by 8.45 am. I talk to reporters about the region I cover. I assess financial risks for companies abroad and warn them of potential problems. I provide three services: a quick news update, a six-month forecast, and a travel security guide. I meet with editors from 9.15 am to 9.30 am to discuss stories. My first report is due by 10.00 am and the second by 11.00 am. I write, edit, and send stories quickly. I travel to Africa three times a year to report on events. I leave work around 6.00 pm, but I often stay awake until 1.00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"'Career Power: How to Be a Good Leader at Work
A. What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires and helps others. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote the book ""Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,"" says leadership is about 'making things happen with people who are as excited as you are.' A good leader should speak clearly and with confidence. Dixon says, 'It's about saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"".'
B. John van Maurik, who teaches a Leadership in Management course, says, 'Many people have more potential for leadership than they know. Becoming a leader is about finding and using your hidden talents.' We all have the ability to be leaders, but we need the right situation. We can see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, but it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. Still, leadership is very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might both be good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they do it? The best leader motivated you and supported you. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first one led well; the second one managed badly.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within rules. Leaders create new ideas. 'A good manager can keep a company running,' says Michael Shea, who wrote ""Leadership Rules."" 'But a good leader can change a company, a team, or even a country.'
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:
* Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find out what you care about. When you feel inspired, use that energy to lead.
* Think of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is important. Recognize it.
* Sometimes you need to be firm. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead. See how things change.
F. * Leadership takes practice. You need to take risks and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and praise.
* Your way of leading might not work for everyone. Keep improving your communication skills. You don't have to be liked, but your ideas should be.
* Be visible and available to important people. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know where your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders.'"

Film critic Nick James talks about some new films.
**A. Abyss**
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made this exciting Cold War movie. It is about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a submarine deep underwater. The leader, Bud, and his team are brave and funny. The special effects are very good, but the story is simple.
**B. The Thin Red Line**
This movie is based on a book about the battle for Guadalcanal. Directed by Andrew Marton, it is different from Terrence Malick's new film. Marton's movie is a traditional war film focusing on one soldier and his tough sergeant. It has some good parts, like the soldier dreaming of his wife.
**C. On Guard**
This fun adventure film is based on a novel from 1875. It has a great villain played by Fabrice Luchini. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, and Daniel Auteuil plays a serious acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film is full of action and humor.
**D. Character**
Set in old Rotterdam, this film looks like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays a strict bailiff named Dreverhaven. The story is about his difficult relationship with his son. The film focuses a lot on the historical details.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This new video version shows director Leone's skills. The sound is very clear, and the music is exciting. The story is about three men, the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach), who are all looking for treasure in the West.
**F. The Longest Day**
This is a long war movie with many stars and extras. It shows the planning of a big invasion. The early parts are slow, but the film is impressive. It is better to watch it on a big screen than on video."

Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is a very interesting book. The story is about a lawyer who starts a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife in court because she is accused of killing her husband. The trial is exciting, and the ending is surprising. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B**  
*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement. Sigismondo, who helps the rich people of the Italian Renaissance, gets involved in politics and murder. We know he will find the guilty people. The story is a bit complicated and long, but it is still very good.
**BOOK C**  
*File Under: Deceased* is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who starts investigating when a man dies near her. She faces challenges, but she is strong and smart. Leah is a great character.
**BOOK D**  
*Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker is about Spenser, a private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to stop drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The conversations are quick and clever, and there is more thinking than usual. It is high-quality entertainment.
**BOOK E**  
*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They look into a crime at a famous actress's daughter's house. The author's easy style and interesting characters make this a fun mystery.
**BOOK F**  
*Blood Red, Snow White* is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It is about a lawyer and his female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story goes on. The book has romance, money, and violence, making it an exciting story.
**BOOK G**  
*Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw is about actor Philip Fletcher, who might become a victim. A funny group of people come together to make a movie about Robin Hood. Philip is not happy with his career. The book is entertaining, but not as good as Shaw's other works.
**BOOK H**  
*Fall Down Easy* by Lawrence Gough is his best book in a while. Canadian police are after a smart bank robber who targets female bank workers. The story builds tension slowly and is better than the average detective novel."
CAE_57,C1,"""I might be too old for this, but here I go! Tim Pozzi, who is 34 years old, left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to do this. This summer, I quit my job, rented my apartment, and decided to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34, and I'm nervous. I have traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning money. I realized I was giving up my happiness for my salary. When I quit my job, I felt like I was in control of my life again. Now, I have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children. They don't want to change places with me, but they envy my freedom. I'm not in a relationship, and I don't have big career goals. I feel like I should use this freedom, even for my friends! Why am I nervous? First, I need to make plans. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I rent it out? And where should I go? I'm bad at making decisions and am already late. I thought, 'I might as well enjoy the summer in England.' Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' It's hard to leave emotional ties. I'm delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Can I live simply again? Will I fit in with young backpackers? Maybe not. Many Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says people realize they can have adventures if they are brave, organized, and confident. Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, want one last adventure before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip.' He worries about his career but thinks it's a risk worth taking. When he left his job, he threw his calculator into the river as a sign of freedom! For Matt, who left the Army, traveling for a year was a big change. In the military, there is a set way to do things. He traveled to change this and live better as a civilian. There are many reasons to travel at my age, but some are common. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says we have a more flexible workforce today. More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose. Big companies even have career-break policies. They prefer employees to come back rather than work for a competitor. Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, says more people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. If you're not happy, you don't have to stay in the same job. Travel gives you a chance to think about your life. Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can't grow up? Jennifer Cox thinks not. She says it's a sign of a better society when we want a balanced life. We ask, 'Is this what I want?' Ben, a 32-year-old going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. He says he's running towards something he wants. But he is a bit scared. He thinks about leaving his comfortable routine, like going to the office and having coffee with colleagues. I also worry about leaving my easy life. I'm not sure I would travel if my boss wasn't so difficult. Jennifer Cox says there is often a reason, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel. I needed a push to start, but now I'm excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, I'll be happy I took this chance. I think all older backpackers feel the same."""
CAE_42,C1,"'Plugging in the home Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from her job in journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. She shares how she changed her family home into a good place to work. The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my career in journalism. My skills were old, from the 1980s, when we used typewriters. I didn't know how to use a computer, and many jobs wanted experience in desktop publishing, which I didn't have. I was afraid of technology; even simple things like calculators confused me. I thought it would be hard to go back to work before my children grew up. But then I entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package for my family. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for everyone. We learned new words like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing. We started talking to people around the world online. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. I could work from home and still take the children to school. The children were good with computers because they learned at school. I was scared I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button, but I learned the basics. It was easy and logical. I started writing for a magazine, about two articles a month, and I felt happy to have the best of both worlds. The computer helped me become organized. I used to lose important papers, but now I keep track of income and expenses with spreadsheets. I can research stories online and talk to other journalists. But working from home can be lonely, and there are distractions like house chores. Sometimes, the children and I argue over who gets to use the computer. Many people now buy computers for education and fun. In my neighborhood, people are starting to work from home instead of traveling to the city. A report says the typical computer user is 38 years old and well-educated. Most have a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM and modem. I feel ready for the future. Maybe one day, I will send a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or start my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless.'"

The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh looks very different from the old buildings around it. It has big, yellow sandstone towers and buildings shaped like cheese wedges. Some people love the modern design, calling it a ""masterpiece,"" while others are not so sure.
Inside, the museum is almost ready to open. It tells many stories about Scotland's history. You can see important things like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels. The museum is not just for experts; it is for everyone, even if you don't know much about history.
Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants visitors to have a fun and interesting time. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no pretend scenes. Instead, there are explanation panels and some computers to help tell the stories.
When you walk inside, you see many different rooms with pale walls and big display cases. There is a lot of light coming in, and you can take your time to look at everything.
The museum also has a special area for children called the Discovery Centre. Kids wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a hands-on center to explore.
On the top floor, there is a gallery about the Twentieth Century. It shows things that people in Scotland think are important, like electric guitars and televisions. This part will change every three years.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects help us understand the past. The modern building looks great from the inside, but some people wonder if it fits with the old city around it."
CAE_54,C1,"'The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It's a nice word and a calming idea. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving slowly and nicely from now to the future. Unless, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, which is not easy - because it might not happen at all. But surely (you say) it will happen one day. Everyone knows that print newspaper sales are going down while visits to their websites are going up. Just look at the latest print numbers. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and others are down between 8% and 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors. This might be true, depending on time, age, place, and more. After all, everyone - from web experts to print experts - says so. But wait a moment and think about some things that don't fit. If sales in that area have fallen a little, maybe the problem mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, the messages are mixed. The latest survey by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped, but Asia made up the difference. As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to be in trouble - they had a 5.4% increase. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many grew fast. You can see a similar thing with books. Kindle and similar e-readers are selling a lot more this year. The first step of transition is clear. Yet, when booksellers looked at the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. Stories about young people not reading newspapers are not true. Look at the latest National Readership Survey numbers and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 reading the main national dailies. And even in Europe, different countries have different stories. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany, the decline has only been 7% - with a mere 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end). Such different national trends may show a situation more complicated than digital change experts think. America's media experts used to say that online advertising money would pay for change and, with lower production costs, make online newspapers a success. But now, with digital ads on newspaper sites going down, such ideas seem old. Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way to get paying readers seems to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access together. In other words, print is also important in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates make nine to ten times more money than online. Of course, this big difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as keeping both a website and a print edition is hard, complex, and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; on the web, just being noticed is much harder.'"
CAE_32,C1,"**Taking Photos of People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more interesting than one without. But, taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer needs to think about actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, the camera can make people act differently.
**A. Group Photos**
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces. You can also take the photo from a higher place.
**B. Posing for Photos**
People often act stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by finding a comfortable position. They can fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**
Do not pretend you are not taking a photo. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their photo taken. They might feel shy at first, but they often feel flattered. You may need to guide them to avoid them looking away from the camera.
**D. Eye Contact**
A photo is more powerful if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They do not have to smile. Remind them just before you take the photo. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. Candid Focus**
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable. The viewer can see what the person is looking at. Candid photos are interesting, and the expression is important.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child makes us smile, while a sad face makes us feel sad too. Look for familiar expressions like winks, anger, or thumbs-up. They are a visual language.
**G. Background Interest**
A person's background can add interest to a photo. Make sure the background is not too busy. Focus on the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look larger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**
When people talk, argue, or work together, there are chances for good photos. Couples, mothers and babies, or teams make nice pictures. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Show how one person reacts to another.
**I. People and Places**
Many photos of people are taken on holiday. To show people with a background, use a wide-angle lens. Move back to get the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera. A good photo shows both the people and the place.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want the photo. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose with a nice background. Family photos can be boring if they are all posed. Candid photos of events are more lively. A spontaneous photo can bring back memories better than a posed one."

Sarah Janson does not usually sign her paintings unless someone asks her to. She thinks the art is more important than the artist. Sarah is very modest and sometimes acts like her paintings make themselves. She does not like to talk about herself. When asked if she wants her photo taken, she covers her face. But later, in her living room, she becomes more relaxed and funny. Sarah has been making this kind of art for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she did not enjoy illustration. She then worked with a decorator named Jim Smart, who asked her to make a trompe-l'oeil painting. She loved it and decided to work on her own. Her skills in observing and detail helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. Sarah says you cannot learn trompe-l'oeil from someone else; it is about observing life. She believes she is still learning and says, 'If you think you know everything, you should stop.' She is honest about what she cannot do well, like painting bread. When she had to paint a big ceiling, she felt unsure and thought, 'Who do you think you are?' Sarah sometimes talks about herself as if she is someone else. Her work is very good, and she has done many important projects. Her art is often inspired by buildings. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and a corridor that looks like it leads to more rooms. Trompe-l'oeil art must trick you and keep your interest. It should also be personal to the client. Sarah enjoys working with clients and getting ideas from them. She says it is important to listen to what they want. Many clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them. Sarah is thankful for her clients and says she is busy because of them. She repeats that she does not like to talk about herself. She believes her art should not be loud. But her work is very interesting and deserves more attention.'"
CAE_61,C1,"'Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success Daniel Goleman talks about 'people skills' that are important for success at work. A The rules for work are changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or our training, but also by how we handle ourselves and others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It shows who might do very well and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs. They are not about doing well in exams. The new measure assumes we have enough knowledge to do our jobs. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These are called emotional intelligence. B Today, job security is not guaranteed, and 'portable skills' are important. Personal qualities are important at work. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. It is not just about 'being nice'. Sometimes it means telling the truth even if it is hard. It is about managing feelings so people can work well together. C More businesses see emotional intelligence as important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. Some people succeed without it, but teamwork and customer focus are important now. Emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job and everywhere. D Unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. Studies show people get better at handling emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned and added to our skills. This is important when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but it helps everything work better.'"

There are rules that say it's okay to use photos without asking if it's very important for the public. But people still talk about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take photos or videos of a news event. This means these photos are important for the media.

CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
**Acupuncture: An Old Practice**
Acupuncture is 2,000 years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine. This includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help with many health problems. In the West, doctors use it mostly for pain. Some doctors, nurses, and therapists use it to help with pain.
**What is Acupuncture?**
Traditional Chinese medicine says health is when the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. Energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), moves through the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ. If Qi is blocked or weak, the body is not in balance, and you may feel weak or sick. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulse, looks at your tongue, and asks about your health and habits. They use thin needles on the skin to help Qi flow better. They may also use heat or pressure.
**Acupuncture Points**
Acupuncture points are on meridians and may not be near the pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This shows the needle has reached the Qi. There are over 300 main points and many more less-used points.
**How Does It Work?**
Doctors in the West think acupuncture can help with pain. They have scientific ideas about how it works. For example, it might block pain signals from reaching the brain. It might also release natural pain-relief chemicals called endorphins.
**What Pain Can Be Treated?**
People with long-term pain often try acupuncture. It is used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in very sick people.
**Modern Use of Acupuncture**
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years. Using it instead of anesthesia in surgery started in the 1950s. This showed some doctors outside China that acupuncture works. In China, it is used in many surgeries, like tonsil removal and heart surgery. Needles may be used alone or with electricity or drugs. Pain is often reduced, but it varies by person. Acupuncture anesthesia has fewer side effects than regular anesthesia.
**Is It Always Effective?**
It is hard to test acupuncture in studies. But some studies show 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with long-term pain. Acupuncturists say it works for many people, but not everyone. For long-term pain, it may take six or seven visits to feel better. Some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.
**A Different View on Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just symptoms. They spend time finding out what causes the pain. They ask if the pain is worse in cold, heat, damp, or wind. They also ask if the pain is sharp, dull, or burning. These things help decide how to treat the pain. Regular doctors may not ask these questions.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals have traditional acupuncture training. Others use scientific ideas. Traditional acupuncturists believe only traditional methods can lead to a long-term cure. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. They should send you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P. D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She looks like a calm and strong person. Some people think she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school. But she is actually a bit shy. She says that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is like her. He likes to solve crimes alone, and so does she. She needs to be alone when she writes. P. D. James is very popular, but she is modest. She has written 12 detective novels, and many people around the world read them. She likes books by her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes as Barbara Vine. She also enjoys books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, and some male writers like Graham Greene.
P. D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband, Connor Bantry White, in Cambridge. He was a student there. Her life was not easy. Her husband came back from the Second World War very sick. She had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped a lot by taking care of the children.
P. D. James worked for the National Health Service and later for the Home Office. She worked in the Police Department and the Criminal Law section. She saw many things related to crime, but she was more interested in writing stories. She liked the challenge of writing crime novels. She wanted to be a serious writer and thought detective stories were a good start. Writing these stories helped her bring order to chaos. She believes solving a crime in a story shows that life is important. She says, ""Nobody really likes violence."""
CAE_5,C1,"'Handwriting Can Show Who You Are'
In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. This is because handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Experts say it can help show some illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can reveal how a person feels or thinks. More companies are using handwriting analysis to help choose people for important jobs. But many doctors and psychiatrists do not believe in graphology.
Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, thinks doctors should take it seriously. She says handwriting can show social class, intelligence, and even if a person is honest or a good worker. She believes it can also show if someone might commit a crime. Criminals often have messy handwriting. They might come from poor backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in their writing.
Ms. Marne says handwriting can also show if someone is under a lot of stress or if they have health problems. If a person's handwriting changes a lot, it might mean something serious is happening. She also says that people who write with very light pressure might be sensitive, and those who write in all capital letters might be hiding something.
Ms. Marne believes it takes six years to learn how to analyze handwriting well. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a true science. Some psychiatrists do not agree with her. They say handwriting is just about education and artistic skill, not about personality or health."
CAE_41,C1,"'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy, healthy team, says a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. Our expert team included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
Office A. Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows open to the street. It is hard to see why this space works, but the team of seven people seem happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, like at home. This might be the key: they have created a happy, home-like office without outside rules.
Ergonomist: The furniture is mixed; no two pieces match. Some furniture causes bad working positions. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable, and many are broken. But the team has a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, meeting clients, making presentations, etc. This variety helps reduce tiredness and boredom.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what others are doing, large enough to work alone. The office is attractive and fun, showing efficiency and creativity.
Office B. News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is not exciting but comfortable, and staff do not dislike it. Air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good. Space is good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are okay. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information more easily. Success stories or project information could be on the walls.
Office C. Bank
Building Health Consultant: This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass case, seeing and being seen by many others. Despite smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air is not stale. Even close to a smoker, you can't smell the cigarette.
Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just okay. Not all chairs meet requirements, but this is user choice. Computer screens are on small desks with lowered keyboard shelves, which is not good for modern equipment.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and have good technology. Many communication awards are on display. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet give a serious look. The office is busy.
Office D. Newspaper
Building Health Consultant: It is hard to say anything good about this office. The air-conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have small desks. The office is dusty, with dust falling from the roof.
Ergonomist: The furniture looks like it belongs in a workshop, not a high-tech office. Most chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially shorter people. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and have armrests that keep users from getting close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, dirty carpets, dust everywhere. The office needs cleaning and better air conditioning -- there are many smokers. Few people were talking when we visited; everyone seemed stressed by deadlines. The company needs to work more as a team.'"
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million pieces every day. It has less than ten calories per piece and is considered a food. This means it must follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture.
In the past, the ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used it to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. In America, colonists learned from the Amero-Indians to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States sold spruce resin for chewing, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, growing sapodilla trees commercially has not worked well, so synthetic alternatives are now used.
Today, a few chicle gatherers, called chicleros, still work in difficult conditions. They travel long distances in hot, humid forests to collect chicle. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly is especially troublesome because it lays eggs in the tappers' ears and nose. Chicleros climb trees with a rope and axe to collect the sap, which they carry to a camp to boil and make into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with simple food and local alcohol.
Even though their work is tough, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. The United States used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but now only 200 tonnes are collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales increase, manufacturers use synthetic materials to save money and meet demand.
Gum producers are finding new ways to sell their products. They say gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tension. During both world wars, soldiers were given gum. Gum is also said to reduce tooth decay by increasing saliva, which helps protect teeth. Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and vegetable oils are used in gum, and most new flavors are artificial. However, some flavors still need natural ingredients. In America, 137 square kilometers are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**B. New Zealand - Hermitage Hotel, Mount Cook**  
The Hermitage Hotel is on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by accident while climbing. We climbed a glacier and walked down to find this hotel. It is in beautiful, wild countryside. After a tiring climb, the luxury of the hotel was amazing. A man was playing piano music by Cole Porter.
**C. Mauritius - Beachcomber Paradis Hotel**  
The Paradis Hotel is on a quiet peninsula in south-west Mauritius. The road to the hotel passes empty beaches. The hotel is not small, and many people enjoy free watersports.

CAE_47,C1,"'The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown checks hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watched her work. Just one minute into the yearly check, and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. The receptionist is talking on the phone about room prices and does not notice Sue Brown, the real guest. 'Hasn't even acknowledged us,' Sue says quietly. 'Very poor.' This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't an ordinary three-star place,' she says. 'It has three red stars, and I expect better.' Having red stars means the Globe is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide from the organization she works for. Even before the cold welcome, there were problems. The way from the car park was through an empty door with a buzzer, then a long, empty hallway to the hotel entrance. 'Again, not what I had expected,' says Sue. Could things get worse? Yes, they could. 'We seem to have no record of your booking,' says the receptionist. That night, 12 of the hotel's 15 rooms are empty. One room is on the top floor. Sue does not like it: it is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. When she started her job, she was known for being tough. 'The Woman in Black, I was called,' she remembers, 'which was funny because I never wore black. And I've never been too tough.' The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the Globe's manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks scared. Before she says more, he apologizes for the bad smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocked drain,' he says. 'The whole floor might need fixing.' Sue suggests not taking guests to that room. 'Better to take them to the other lounge,' she says. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months. Sue says this check will help the hotel in the long run. Not everything is bad. Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, are praised. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, 'What do we need for three rosettes?' Sue suggests, 'Not serve a pudding that collapses.' Greaves' hope fades. Sue's job is to say the complaints that other guests are too scared to say. 'Sometimes it's hard. Once, a woman said I got her son fired. I just told the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers.' Sue also writes a full report for the hotel. They pay to be in the guide. Having red stars is worth it. Greaves is happy to hear Sue will not suggest taking away the Globe's red stars. That is the good news. The bad news is another inspector will come in the next two months to check if things are fixed. 'Good,' smiles Greaves, not very convincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.''"
CAE_48,C1,"**Seven Up: Climbing the Seven Summits**
Doug Scott, a mountaineer, tells about climbing the highest mountain on each continent, called the Seven Summits. He started this adventure later in life. Here is his story:
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**
Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the top. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, which Doug thought was strange. Doug also talked to his feet because of the cold. They were worried about frostbite. Doug felt confident with Dougal and knew they would reach the top, which they did.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**
This mountain is very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal carried their gear to the base. They climbed a new route with everything on their backs. The climb was hard, and they suffered from the cold. The air pressure made it feel like they were higher than they were. They finally reached the top and felt triumphant.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite went to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up on Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle and were happy to find a trail. They tried a difficult route but changed to an easier one to reach the top.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, met a guide who suggested a different route. They avoided the glacier due to time limits and joined others on the standard path. They reached the top before dark. At base camp, Doug met climbers who inspired him to climb all Seven Summits.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**
Doug realized he could climb Vinson Massif by guiding people to cover costs. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. Despite strong winds and cold, they reached the top in 8 hours. The storm made it hard to see, but they were happy.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**
In summer 1994, Doug's team went to Elbrus. They took a cableway and walked to a refuge. The wind was strong, and they thought they reached the top, but there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and went down the next day.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**
Doug's team wanted to find a new route and meet the local Dani people. They were warned about bandits but continued. On May 12, they climbed and reached the top by 11 am. Doug was celebrated for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

Ned Ingham: Dress Designer Ned Ingham makes beautiful wedding dresses. 'People should choose simpler styles instead of traditional, stiff dresses,' he says. Ingham started drawing and designing wedding dresses when he was a schoolboy. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. You don't have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress: he also makes long evening dresses with new colors and fabrics. For those who like classic styles, Ingham designs a summer navy-blue suit, a favorite in England for many years. Sally Quail: Jeweller Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but did not study jewellery formally. She started designing jewellery when she couldn't find an engagement ring she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous people wear her jewellery. Her style is big semi-precious stones in gold, like jewellery from the 18th century. Recently, she started using diamonds. 'It must be my age,' says 36-year-old Quail. 'I wanted a diamond, so I began working with them.' Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer Lily Grimson started her business four years ago and has already had two of her handbags chosen for a big design show. Her bags are never ignored. All of Grimson's bags are handmade in the UK. They are glamorous, made from fine calfskin or heavy silk. A Grimson bag is special because of its style and quality. Peter Little: Hairdresser For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. 'Most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home,' he says. His goal is to make sure his clients don't look like they just left a salon. But his services are expensive - £250 for the first visit, and there's a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home. Penny Pratt: Florist Penny Pratt runs a small shop and is a flower consultant for a big supermarket chain. She also gives ideas to top restaurants. She used to be a teacher but changed careers 10 years ago. Her simple and modern flower designs have won many prizes, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has given successful talks in Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are simpler now. Keep them simple but strong, and don't use too many leaves. For wedding bouquets, use flowers of the same kind.'"

This system helps give special service to guests who come back. It cost a lot of money, but MacCann says it will be worth it. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs, they will have them ready next time. The system remembers what guests like. Many guests complain about room temperature. The hotel has a special system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little, or the front desk can change it more. Business guests will like the technology in the rooms. MacCann thinks many guests will be business people. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and video-conferencing. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. They rent TVs so they can get new ones easily. DVD players can also be updated. Even with all this technology, the rooms are comfortable and welcoming. The hotel has 145 large rooms, a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a garden. The food must be excellent.

FCE_13,B2,"'No Title Many trees in the Brackham area fell down in the big storms that March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. The town centre looked very different without these trees, and some people were not happy about it. One of these people would usually be Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. Pelham, a strong and healthy man, was very ill with bronchitis for the first time. When he first felt a headache and chest pain, his wife, Molly, told him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forget things and get angry easily. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to get his medicine and then home to his wife, who sent him to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him the walnut tree fell during the night, but Pelham couldn't understand. On Thursday evening, he asked about damage to the house, was happy there was none, and went back to sleep. On Saturday, when he felt better, he saw that the missing walnut tree changed how the living-room looked. The Pelhams' big house had a large garden. It was expensive, but Pelham was happy they bought it. The garden made the house feel private. But now, the storm changed this. Before, the walnut tree was part of the view from the living-room. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it made nice light patterns that hid the old furniture. Without the tree, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was not nice. The tall house next door, once hidden by the tree, was now visible with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It had many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. 'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. 'I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.''"
FCE_16,B2,"'Living in the valley We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, before winter, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimetres deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved but the branches stayed strong. Yet, we knew we had a reason to worry. The snow and wind were inconvenient but not a big problem. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams. Soon the snow started to melt. Every day, we watched dark clouds over the hills to the west. Grey clouds covered the valleys. They moved and rose, warning us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was washed away as more rain came from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and was close to danger. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. In the hills, it was like a waterfall, as water went over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water rushed down. Just a few metres from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down. Many times before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river and usually all is well; the water from the hills stays behind the dam with just a little overflow sometimes. We can enjoy, not fear, the big clouds over the valley, and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this protection, we feel our home in the valley is safe.'"
FCE_21,B2,"'Film Critic Mark Adams talks about his last ten years working as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I wrote reviews for novels, films, and radio. That's how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. He also wrote for radio and TV. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist. At first, he wanted a team of critics to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to cover, with guests to make it fun. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed. I even thought a millionaire was pretending to hire me. I had little confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and saw my review, I didn't know what to do. Tom's idea for a team of critics didn't work out. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so we did everything by phone. People preferred a reviewer to focus on one subject, so I chose film. Without Tom's help, we wouldn't have the current setup, where I write a long piece each week, usually on one film. This way of working suits me. I wouldn't like the usual film critic's job, which means reviewing every film. That would make me bored quickly. I would soon be thinking, 'What boring film must I watch now?' This is a common feeling among critics. The space I have lets me expand my argument or, in a dull week, create something interesting. But what is my role? I think people choose films based on stars, publicity, or the director. People are loyal to certain types of films. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to watch one after reading a review, or for a romance fan to skip a love story because of a review. So, if a film review isn't a guide, what is it? I don't feel I must be 'right' about a movie. I don't think there should be a set number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. I just need to present an argument. I'm not a judge, and I don't want to be.'"

She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realize they can't go any further, she just kept on."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another price to pay. Her hard training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."" Where will all this focus end? Melanie has tried other events. She has tried the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, that."
FCE_70,B2,"'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about the things she collects and why many people like this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults enjoys this hobby. It is a world of passion and happiness. But remember, if you do not love an object, do not collect it. Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors. Today, children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty. I have been collecting all my life. I collect many things, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. It was cold and windy, with many hills. My parents visited me and took me to a local museum. It was full of objects collected by people in the past. I loved these objects. Many adults share this passion for collecting. People collect for different reasons. Some like to have control over something. For me, it's just fun. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with many interesting things. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You do not need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember getting a special tulip from another collector. I planted it, but one day it was stolen. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them. But my collection was destroyed in a house fire. The next day, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I was very sad. I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet is valuable. As small objects become popular, their price goes up. Toys from the 1950s are now an investment if you kept the original boxes. (I threw mine away, including the toys.)'"
FCE_3,B2,"'My Job Four people talk about their jobs. Lisa - Exhibition Organiser, Science Museum I plan temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and tell people about it. I read about the subject first and talk to important people to decide the main ideas. I plan what objects and pictures to show. I make sure people can understand the exhibition. I plan interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to make sure everything is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets. Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers I start work at 7.30 a.m. and check the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents we need for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning the routes. They find the most direct route, using the correct streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if you can turn right at a junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route and tell them they have to find another way because the road is closed. The next student finds a third route, and I give a reason why they can't go that way. This makes them think. Sarah - Marine Conservationist I live by the sea and work from home. I answer phone calls, make educational resources, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but usually, I am by the sea. I work with schools and study centres and run courses for people who make decisions about the sea. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them think more about sea life. This often changes their views. I am lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. The bad part is I work for a charity, so we always need more money. I am always looking for more resources and can't do everything I want. Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher My work is varied. I make sure our books match what people want and keep stocks of about 300 books. We have high standards for information. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and these need careful answers. I talk about future projects and sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic group, which makes the job enjoyable. The bad part is there is too much administration, so there is less time for interesting tasks like product development and design.'"
FCE_10,B2,"'Our Holiday in Ireland We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes to it, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We think it's quite a coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling when we arrived this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she's usually waiting in the big hall that smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' These are the names of the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she does little things like that; her husband does the repairs. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur took our luggage to the rooms, carrying as much as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns, others going down the cliff path to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we had a routine. Since we first came here, we all loved the beautiful landscape.'"
FCE_67,B2,"'Keeping the holiday-makers happy Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She talks to Veronica Lee while making beds and cooking dinners. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex. People call her Pilch. Sarah works in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for people who come to ski and stay in chalets. Chalets are wooden houses. Sarah finished her studies in French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is fun for a year or two before starting a serious job. 'It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. 'They get porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the worst part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. She skis as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah goes back to the chalet to make dinner. She takes a shower but does not sleep. 'If you sleep, it's hard to wake up,' she says. Dinner is three courses and starts at 8 p.m. Coffee is ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and fills the dishwasher. 'I don't like a messy kitchen in the morning.' Sometimes she talks with the guests, other times they want to be alone. 'Good guests make the week fun, but some weeks are not so good.' Sarah meets her friends where she lives, and they go out at 11 p.m. 'We start at Bananas, then maybe G Jay's, and end at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. But Sarah does not stay out late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. 'It's a hard day,' she says, 'and you don't want to cook breakfast with a headache.' On Sunday, work starts early. Breakfast for leaving guests is at 7 a.m. After they leave, Sarah cleans a lot. 'We clean everything - clear breakfast, change beds, get ready.' If she did not shop on Saturday, she shops now. At 3 p.m., cleaning is done, and Sarah makes tea for new guests. 'They arrive around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I think the mountain air affects them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests with ski boots or skis and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it's time for dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I go to bed early,' she says."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 
Three or four times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita Cohen was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, they visited the factory to see how Marie's dad made gloves. They especially liked the laying-off table, where men shaped and pressed each glove over steam-heated brass hands. The hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up, looking flat. As a child, Marie called them 'pancake hands'.
Rita asked, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' Seymour replied, 'Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She took notes and asked, 'Do they come directly to your shipping department?' Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started. Have you ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet,' Rita said. 'Well, you should visit a tannery if you're writing about leather. I can arrange that for you. They're old-fashioned places. Technology has improved things, but it's not very different from hundreds of years ago. It's hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. Six-thousand-year-old tanning relics were found in Turkey. The first clothes were just skins tanned by smoking them. My father is the leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk about gloves for two days. Glovemen love their trade. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.' He laughed. She made him laugh. She was eager to learn. His daughter was 30 cm taller than Rita, fair where Rita was dark, but Rita reminded him of Marie. Marie was smart and remembered everything from school. 'I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll show you the whole process. Come on. We'll make you a pair of gloves, and you'll watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'"
FCE_71,B2,"'Is it a dream job? Chris Arnot asks four people if their jobs are as great as they seem. A. Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she travels a lot. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But she has one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to calm down,' she says. Her worst flight was on Concorde. 'It felt very closed in with those small windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does paperwork, organizes the diary, attends meetings, and makes travel plans. She didn't apply for the job. She met a pop group's manager by chance and got a job behind the scenes. She also took secretarial classes at night. Five years later, she became a PA when her boss needed one. B. David Brown David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He liked being a caddy more because he loves golf. But there are some downsides. Caddies get a small fee and a part of the winnings. They earn between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of it goes on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first worked for golfer Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You give advice and try to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were noticed by European Tour Productions, and they made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies' cards. TV commentators, golf magazines, and golfers want these results. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food in top restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? 'If people can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave.' His cooking talent got him a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. At the time, Martin was a creative director at an ad agency, and the column was extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. 'It meant earning 50% less,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job.' He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. 'Before that, I loved words and wrote mostly poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'It's not easy, I have to work on them,' he says. 'I usually do this in the mornings. I'm not an early riser. After lunch, I type out my morning notes with one finger on an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and I enjoy this part of being a writer. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,B2,"'In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were made into boards for building, there was an old brick building with two floors. Around the building, there were big piles of soft sawdust. These piles covered the yard down to the blue lake. That afternoon, the boys were bored and followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. 'I dare you all!' he shouted. 'You're all cowards,' he said, trying to make them jump too. The boys looked down from the roof, scared, but then they jumped one by one and felt happy. In the hot sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one boy said, 'Let's go up and jump again.' They all went up and jumped off the roof again, except for Michael. The others were below, calling, 'Come on, Mike. What's wrong?' Michael wanted to jump but stayed on the roof, nervous. He tried to count to ten and jump, but it didn't work. The boys started to laugh at him and got tired of waiting. 'Come on, you're a coward,' they shouted. When he didn't move, they walked away. Michael stayed on the roof, looking at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour while the sun set. His clothes were wet from sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, and fell on the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The workmen had gone home. He wondered why he couldn't jump and then got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said, 'You're old enough to come home on time. If you won't come home, stay in tonight.' She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke seriously, but Michael, feeling sad, didn't really hear her. He was still thinking about the boys laughing at him.'"
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy with your job but don't know how to change it? Kitty Doherty has some advice. Many people who want to change jobs go to a careers adviser. You will write a short history about yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a report with career suggestions and possible retraining needed.
I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The test felt like a science exam. I was with about ten people, answering questions quickly. It wasn't about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the test, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and advice. I agreed with most of it, but I was surprised I did poorly in science and technical tests. I was glad to hear I made the right choice with journalism.
Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to try Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to look at my career,' says Donna. She found out she was good at design but had to think about the cost of retraining. Other ideas included working in the Far East for a year. She decided to use her skills in a new job as a Public Relations officer. Career Analysts helped her see what she wanted to do.
Some people feel they couldn't have changed without help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services. She worked at a bank for six years and wanted a new challenge. The tests showed she liked sciences. After four sessions with an adviser, she decided to study geology. She plans to start a degree in it. Juliet thinks the advice was worth the money and feels happier now.
But careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, didn't find it helpful. She wanted new ideas but didn't like the options because they meant less money or more training. She felt a friend could have given similar advice."
FCE_22,B2,"'Fun at the Dentist's? If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the wall and a nice blue couch for patients. Jerome says, 'Half of the people only go to the dentist when they have pain. They are scared.' To help with this, he tries to make his office a place where people are not afraid. He does not wear a white coat because it makes people think of pain. Jerome believes dental visits should be relaxing and even fun. This is surprising because many people think of dental visits as painful. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed and happy, they will forget bad experiences.' He uses virtual-reality headsets to help people relax. 'We were the first in Britain to use them, and people like them. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while I check their teeth. Then, they see a video tour of their mouth.' Many patients enjoy this. The office also smells nice, like oranges, not like a dentist's office. Jerome says, 'I want people to know it's different here. Smell is important. The usual dentist smell can make people nervous.' I found the smell very nice. Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, but he is serious about his work. Relaxation is important, but good treatment is most important. He uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth, not scraping them. It feels strange at first, but it is not painful if you are relaxed. Five years ago, Jerome went to the USA to learn about dental techniques. 'I learned that if you make it easy for the patient, it's easy for you too,' he says. He thinks this is the start of a change in British dentistry. A patient arrives, and Jerome offers him tea and asks what video he wants to watch. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a regular dentist's office.'"
FCE_39,B2,"**Chocolate: A Sweet Story**
Chocolate comes from South America. Today, it is a big business around the world. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is 8% of all chocolate sales. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.
Chocolate comes from the cacao plant. This plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan people in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant. It grows in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a mistake from the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in their language. The drink was made with spices and used for special events. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar. But it took another 100 years for the recipe to spread in Europe.
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's big cities. People went there to drink chocolate. Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands made chocolate powder by taking out most of the cocoa butter from the beans.
The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847. A company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block you could eat. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.
In the early 1900s, French companies led the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to sound French. But in 1905, Cadbury made the Dairy Milk bar, which became very popular. It was advertised as healthy because of the milk.
Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. To sell more, companies make chocolate bars into ice creams, drinks, or desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers still struggle because of low cocoa bean prices in the 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, think of them when you enjoy your next chocolate bar."
FCE_18,B2,"'THE SHELL ARTIST Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is very good at making art with shells. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he is happy making beautiful objects from shells. He shows me his work in his apartment and says, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" But he is not boring; he is very interesting and charming. He points to some shell ornaments above his fireplace and says he doesn't mind if people don't buy them because he loves them. He never planned to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. Five years ago, he had an exhibition in London, and 70% of his work was sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The pieces are expensive, with some costing around £2,000. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225. Cooke says he doesn't set the prices and is happy to talk about them. He believes no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him that people will want his pieces because he will stop making them one day. Cooke wishes he started this art earlier in life because he could have made even more wonderful things. He says he is more limited now because of his age, but his work is still very special. His art is different from the shell items you find in seaside shops. He makes boxes with tiny shells, pictures from shells, and flowers that look real. Cooke has his own way of working and uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says he has an idea of what he wants to do, and it just happens, but his work shows great attention to detail. Cooke looks for beautiful and tiny shells in places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who say he is taking too many shells. He says people walking on the beach break more shells than he collects, and the sea also breaks them. He would never take shells with living creatures inside. Cooke's work is very beautiful, and he believes it is worth collecting the shells.'"
FCE_62,B2,"'The Schoolgirl Model When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to exciting places and appearing on magazine covers, she is probably studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I was trying to forget all the bad things I had read about models, like being difficult and vain. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided to go to the hairdresser instead of talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not answer my questions. But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and said sorry for being late. She was with her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. She was very friendly, very tall, and very pretty. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained. Her mother looked like a normal mum, proud of her daughter. Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense because it was not planned. Her older sister wanted her to enter the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should try it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos anyway.' When they called to say she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final made Kira confident, and she did very well. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work. Kira now finds it hard to manage her two lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, some people at her school are not nice about her success. 'They say I think too much of myself.' This must be hard for Kira because she is not self-important. But she says, 'They think that because I'm a model now, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I'm more confident - not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.' As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call anytime and tell her she has a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us"".' Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career. Not many people can say that before they finish school. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do if she wasn't a model. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.'"
FCE_49,B2,"**Father and Son Search for Gold**
Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son team. They have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain has a lot of gold. After ten years of digging, they believe they are close to finding gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, says, ""We are finding gold as we dig. We just need to dig a few more meters.""
Their search started when Terence read about gold in the ""Dolgellau gold belt"" in Wales. They read old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library. They chose the best area to dig. They cleared the land, found some gold, and spent ten years getting permission to dig. They also removed old cars and rubbish. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.
Now, they need more money. They spent their savings and need someone to give them £50,000 to dig a bit more. Chris says, ""It looks hard to find someone to help, but we have some people to ask.""
People in the area are interested in the gold search. Dolgellau, a town that relies on tourists, is hopeful. Peter Woolven, who manages the Royal Ship Hotel, says, ""If they find gold, more people might visit. But I hope not too many people come and dig up the hillside.""
The Welsh gold industry was big in the late 1880s, but now it is small. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, closed recently. But some people are still looking for gold. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig on the other side of the hill. Hall, who is 70, says, ""Searching for gold is exciting. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"'IN HOT WATER Rachel Mills is a scientist who works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel Mills teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemical processes in the sea. She is a teacher at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, like a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'there is not much space. I can touch the two pilots.' They are used to these conditions. They cannot stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and then three hours to go back up to the surface. 'If anything happens, and you have a problem and need to get to the top quickly, you can press a panic button.' The outside drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface. 'No one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a nice journey.' 'I didn't know how I would feel the first time I got into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He then explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react in such a small place.' Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a place five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a big area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes together. The Russian team was putting some scientific equipment there to study the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' When she is not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research into the ""black smokers"".' This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This comes out at a speed of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees. 'The only time I was scared was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a big bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the window and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I had studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was such an amazing feeling.''"
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was very tired. My mind couldn't handle more foreign timetables, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said, as I arrived home. I said the same thing the next year. And the next. I just needed to buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five years old, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train's movement helps you sleep deeply. Carrying everything in a backpack makes travel simple. You might even throw away socks that smell bad or books you finish reading. This is the Inter-Rail spirit. You don't need to think too much. Just have a ticket in your hand. This train ticket lets young people travel to many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to go to our camp-site in southern France. But we wanted to travel more because there was always another country to see. And it didn't cost us extra. We were not very interested in culture. This was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. We made our own plans and only saw the easiest sights. We wanted to escape guided tours and do something different. I was happy to see just the view from the station in many places. We were there to enjoy ourselves. We were like other Inter-Railers, sharing train floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city is real only when the train arrives, and you see it with your own eyes. You can understand Europe better by seeing the changing landscapes and different lifestyles. Everyone knows what is there, but it means more when you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos are boring. The train trip won't show you new things in the world, but it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps people see this, even if it takes time."
FCE_37,B2,"'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your baggage is not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, you may be in a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and they cannot always make sure your luggage is on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes. 
Airlines ask you to check in early to give enough time for your baggage to be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times to transfer between flights, and they are also longer to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause baggage issues. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off label, can also cause problems. These issues are worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. 
The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to Latin America. To avoid losing your baggage, choose direct flights if you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline and allow more time between flights. Label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, and include flight numbers. If your luggage is lost, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,B2,"'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This bird is blue-green and lives near streams and rivers. It eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, making some parts of the water dark. The main colors are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher flies very fast and straight, like a flash of light. It is small, but very powerful. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He cannot say exactly why he likes them so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. In Greek myth, a moon goddess became a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. This story has some truth. Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. The feathers reflect light, which makes them look blue. The color can change to green when the light angle changes. Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. They are shy but can be watched from a hidden place. Charlie James first hid under an old blanket to watch them. The bird came close, but it took him four years to take a good picture. He spent a lot of time by streams with kingfishers. School was a problem because it took time away from the birds. He missed classes and did not do well in school. But people noticed his interest in kingfishers. At 16, he worked for a nature magazine. Later, he became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make a film about kingfishers with no talking, just beautiful pictures. He likes simple things and wants to show the colors of the kingfisher's wings. His photos show his feelings, but he knows there is more to his love for kingfishers than his work can show.'"
FCE_68,B2,"'Conducting an Orchestra Conducting an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work. A. ANNE MANSON Anne Manson, 30, wanted to watch conductor Claudio Abbado in Vienna. She ended up helping him because his assistant was not there. She was not nervous. Anne is American and works with a London opera company. She is becoming known in Europe with help from the British Arts Council. She has helped Abbado many times since then. B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. Winning gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. He hopes people will not only remember him for the competition. The English Chamber Orchestra invited him back, which is good for his career. C. WASFI KANI Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She enjoys the long practice time for operas. She began conducting in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional. Lessons with Sian Edwards were important for her. She likes the challenges of opera and working with singers. D. ROGER VIGNOLES Roger Vignoles, 48, is surprised to be conducting but finds it interesting. He was a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano. It was easier than he thought. He uses all his past experience in music. He is open to trying new things. E. WAYNE MARSHALL In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, now 32. Marshall soon conducted a musical in London. It was hard, but he was firm with the musicians. He gives clear instructions and is not afraid to say what he wants. He never studied conducting formally but is determined and knows what he likes.'"
FCE_23,B2,"'Theme Park Visits If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to try the best ones. Fun Island - The Burns family Last year we went to a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. But we were surprised. The park is good for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. But the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe. Wonderland - The McMillan family None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, with small models of famous buildings! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We spent six hours there and liked that there were places to rest. The park looks nice, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults. Adventure World - The Jeffree family After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with a great trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they said they liked it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is fun. The children looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small to go on it! The park is well designed, so waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member went with one of them. The Great Park - The Langridge family We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were older, they might find it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it. Fantasy World - The Break-all family The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very high, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was worse! There are about twelve main rides, and the older children went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides, but she liked the Long Slide. We found the staff were sometimes nice, but not always. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't tell the kids we were leaving early.'"
FCE_60,B2,"'Running a business in the countryside Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside. A. 'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who has a computer design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. 'My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted a job I could do at home. I had worked with computers before, so my husband suggested I start a computer design business. It needed a lot of money and was hard at first. But I was careful and told the bank if I was spending too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. It is a small business. People from the area usually come to us to get their work.' B. 'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who designs greeting cards at home. 'I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where there were no museum jobs. So I started my own business and make 50 different greeting cards to sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The bad thing about working from home is there is always something to do, like mowing the lawn. I get business by word of mouth and don't advertise. People send work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't share ideas with others, but there are more good things than bad.' C. 'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, who makes curtains. 'I started my business eight years ago. At first, my business grew, and in two years, my earnings went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to have six full-time workers. But I had to let them go because the economy got worse, which was hard because there are not many jobs here. Now, I make curtains at home with my husband's help and use women who work from their homes. I have to lower my prices when needed and look for new chances.' D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. First, because London was too expensive, and second, because I love the country. I like working when I want to. Most of my money comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The bad thing is that it takes discipline to stop working. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. All my work experience was in London, so I felt very alone at first.' E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake business and a shop, making £250,000 a year and has six workers, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes with good flour and eggs. Then friends and family asked for cakes, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building, and everything is made there. We have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don't cook now, as I manage the business side. My biggest problem has been the financial side because we didn't have a lot of money to start with.'"
FCE_1,B2,"'Meet the Amazing Watkins Family The sons are musicians and composers, and Dad makes the instruments. Matthew Rye reports. Families with musicians are not rare. But it is special to find a family with music writers, performers, and an instrument maker. John and Hetty Watkins, schoolteachers from South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul. They found it was very expensive. John says, 'We looked at different dealers, and it was clear it would cost a lot.' So, he thought about making one himself. He found the Welsh School of Instrument Making near his home and went to evening classes once a week for about three years. 'After making a few violins and violas, he tried his first cello,' Paul, now 28, says. 'It was really good. He made me another one later, and I used it until a few months ago.' John has now retired from teaching to make instruments full-time. He makes up to twelve violins a year. Selling one to the famous American player Jaime Laredo was 'the icing on the cake'. Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano: 'As soon as I was big enough to reach the keys, I played,' he remembers. But soon, he wanted to play the cello. 'My parents wanted me to play the violin because Dad played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. I tried it for six weeks but didn't like it. I liked the cello player in Dad's group. I thought he was cool when I was six or seven. He gave me lessons, and that's how it started. Later, they suggested my brother play the violin too, but he didn't want to.' 'My parents were supportive and relaxed,' Huw says. 'I wouldn't have liked being pushed. Instead of feeling jealous of Paul's success, I wanted to be like him.' Now 22, Huw is becoming known as a pianist and composer. Meanwhile, John's cello helped Paul a lot. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At 20, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he has a Francesco Rugeri cello from the Royal Academy of Music. 'Dad hasn't said anything about me changing cellos, but he tried both and said my new one is nice! The only thing Dad's cello doesn't have is the power to fill large concert halls. It will get better with age, like my Rugeri, which is 304 years old.' Soon, Paul will be on TV playing the Rugeri in Elgar's Cello Concerto in the new series, Masterworks. 'The history of the performance doesn't change how I play,' he says. 'I will always play it my way.' But Paul can't watch himself on TV because he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival the same night. Huw also can't watch because his String Quartet is playing in London at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will have to be busy to follow all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks.'"
FCE_53,B2,"'Taking Care of the Countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust. Gareth says a warden needs common sense and must be good with people. He talks to farmers, visitors, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm. He got the warden job because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. He is also strong enough for the job, which includes building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Gareth has learned more about nature conservation since working with the Trust. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and now sees how farming has changed the countryside. He says it's not the farmers' fault; they followed government advice. When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists disagreed. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's work includes conservation, letting people visit Trust land, planting trees, and meeting farmers. He likes finishing projects, but he also spends time on paperwork. Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to most visitors but dislikes when some people act like they own the place. If you have common sense and like outdoor work, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But don't expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula soon!'"
FCE_55,B2,"'The Netball Captain In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked her. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 'I have a strict plan to be very fit for them.' These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries taking part. 'We'll have support from people here, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to make netball more popular in this country. Because we are playing here, there will be more pressure. People will expect us to start with a good game.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They have lots of skill.' The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra says, the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, there's no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance.' In the fifteen years she has been playing at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we are all friendlier.' Netball is also more scientific now with fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I need a strong mind and to lead by example. I support and encourage the team.' 'From the start, my netball career was carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player.' She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'"
FCE_50,B2,"'SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS How can you help a child with great musical talent? It is not always easy to know how to support their gift. Some parents might not notice their child's need until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but musically talented children need special help. Ordinary schools might not have this help, especially if music is not important there. Children with musical talent might do well at a specialist music school. There are five music schools in Britain. These schools help talented children aged seven to eighteen to improve their skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend one third to one half of their day on music activities. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras, learn voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice for several hours a day in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is for important subjects like English, math, science, and languages. These schools are independent, with small classes and many teachers. Most children live at the school full-time. This means they grow up with others who have the same interests. What are the problems? One problem is the cost; it is expensive (PS12,000-PS17,000 a year for boarders). But schools try to help with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want their children to live away from home at a young age. School directors worry about children as young as seven in such a strict environment. They want to help children become well-rounded people. Being apart from others can be stressful for musically talented children. Their talent might change as they grow up, and pressure to succeed can make them feel like failures. But schools watch each child's progress and offer help if needed. Many former students say they learned a lot from the music teaching, but some worry about the limited academic program. Many talented children are also smart and want more academic challenges. It might be better to wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves about a specialist education. Children who are good at both music and academics might do well in a regular school with a good music program or by taking music lessons at a music college on Saturdays. But this is not possible for families who live far from big cities.'"
FCE_25,B2,"'An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her big garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden has many of her favorite flowers, like tulips and poppies. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. There is a nice mix of colors and shapes in the flower beds along the path in the garden. The people who lived there before loved gardening and left plants that Susan likes. She also got the gardener, Danny, from them. 'It was really his garden,' she says. 'We got along well. At first, he didn't like some of my ideas, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood.' Susan likes to paint one plant at a time, not the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. 'I don't paint everything at once,' she says. 'I paint one flower, which can take a few days, then I add another one. Sometimes it takes years to finish.' Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. 'They all bloom together, and you're so busy,' she says. She also likes how flowers change as they get older. With tulips, for example, 'you put them in water, and after a day, they change shape. They open and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change with twists and turns.' Susan has always liked plants: 'I studied botany at school and collected wild flowers,' she says. 'I didn't like garden flowers then; I thought they looked fake. I liked wild flowers because they grew in hard places, like rocks.' Now, her garden has plants from faraway places, but they grow well there. She lets the garden grow freely, like an aunt who lets children play as long as they don't break anything. With two art shows coming up, and many flowers to paint, she doesn't have much time for the garden. She has another gardener now, but she knows she needs to work in the garden to stay connected to her art.'"
FCE_34,B2,"'Keeping the holiday-makers happy Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She talks to Veronica Lee while making beds and cooking dinners. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex. People call her Pilch. Sarah works in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in chalets. Chalets are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah finished her studies in French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University last summer. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can have up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. 'They get porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. 'Cleaning is the worst part of the job,' she says. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. She skis as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower before cooking. 'It's bad if you sleep,' she says. Dinner is three courses and is served at 8 p.m. Coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and loads the dishwasher. 'I don't like a messy kitchen in the morning.' Sometimes she talks with the guests, other times they want to be alone. 'Good guests make the week fun, but some weeks are not as good.' Sarah meets her friends at her chalet and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We start at Bananas, then maybe G Jay's, and end at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. But Sarah does not stay out late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. 'It's a hard day,' she says, 'and you don't want to be tired when cooking breakfast.' Work starts earlier on Sunday, as breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. 'We clean everything - clear breakfast, strip beds, get ready.' If she didn't shop on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for new guests. 'They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. I think it's the mountain air.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests with ski boots or skis and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it's time for dinner again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I go to bed early,' she says.'"

There is a train from Cannes that goes along the coast and into Italy. The views of the sea are amazing. It doesn't matter if it is sunny or rainy, it is always beautiful. You can also see nice gardens and houses. The people on the train are interesting, with both tourists and locals enjoying the trip. Raj Patel - Explorer I have taken many train trips, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to the Kruger National Park because I was too young. When I moved to England, I saw my first big train station, London Waterloo, and it amazed me. Betty Cooper - Novelist I love the Blue Train because it took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey through France and then by boat up the Nile was the perfect way to relax after our wedding. Martin Brown - Journalist We were writing articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not fixed, and the driver would wait for people. When the train came, many people climbed on, even on the roof. At night, the train went through beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream. Arisu Mezuki - Actress Most people like trains from when they are children, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus and saw few trains. As a teenager, I made a film in Yorkshire with a railway. The old train line was kept by volunteers. That's when I started to love steam trains. When we were not filming, we rode the train. I went back last year, and everything was the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!'"
FCE_8,B2,"'Do you want to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. Selling your writing needs knowledge about the 'writing world'. No matter what you write, you need to know about the markets you want to reach. The best way to do this is by reading a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading will show you what publishers want. Remember, things change often. New magazines come out, editors change jobs, and magazines change style. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. If you want to write short love stories, first find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and see what kind of stories they like. Pay attention to who reads these magazines. Writers often ask me, 'My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?' As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But maybe the work is not ready to be published. Most new writers send their work too soon. If you have only written one story, it is not likely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Write ten or even twenty more. Each story will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. Don't throw any stories away—improve them. I suggest not showing your work to others at first. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections. Do everything you can to become a writer. Look for a creative writing course or join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"
FCE_4,B2,"'Waiting at the Train Station On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I thought there would be. The station did not feel clean and nice like usual. Older couples with matching bags sat on the benches. Many college students sat on the floor with their bags. A man with grey hair was talking to different people. He looked rich: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft, beige coat. He asked a woman sitting alone a question. Then he talked to a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I thought I might like to talk to her too. The man asked, 'Are you going to Philadelphia?' 'Well, I'm going north,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?' 'No, New York, but I'll be ...' 'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and moved to the next bench. Now I was interested. 'Ma'am,' he asked an old lady, 'are you going to Philadelphia?' She said, 'Wilmington,' and he moved on to a couple with matching bags. I stood up and moved closer, looking at the platform like I was thinking about the train. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. But I knew why he didn't. I probably looked unreliable. He just looked at me quickly and went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked worried. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!' She put her book down. She was about thirty-five, older than me. She looked like a teacher. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Yes, I am.' 'Could I ask you a favour?' I stopped a few feet away and looked at my wrist. (I don't have a watch.) I could tell she was careful. The man must have noticed too, because he said, 'Nothing too hard, I promise!' They announced my train. People started moving to Gate E, the older couples pulling their bags like big pets. I heard the man talking. 'My daughter is flying out today for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, then went for groceries. When I got home, my wife was upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn't know what to do.' The woman made a sympathetic sound. I would have stayed quiet. I wanted to know what he wanted. 'I told her to stay there. I would find someone here to take her passport.' A likely story! Why didn't he go himself if it was so important? 'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked. 'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.' This seemed like a bad excuse to me. It was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one, like a small book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel what was inside! And it looked stapled shut. Be careful, lady, I thought.'"
FCE_30,B2,"'Gary and Me John Moore, a restaurant owner, writes about his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. I believe everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for me. Starting this business made me remember my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory, and I was upset because I was alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family.' My wife took care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant, and we always made sure to have meals together. This was good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life. Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. When he was older, he worked for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined. He used to wake up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as the men working there, and sometimes he was in charge. He would make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he was talented. So when he said, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for school,' I sent him to a friend who has a restaurant. Gary recently started playing the drums and now he has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can do well. He understood when I said: 'Gary, if you want to succeed, do it by the age of 30. If not, it might be too late.' Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had finished everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping others. We can't believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show is. I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work hard for it, because no one gives you anything. He saw his chance and took it. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even a little of what you say, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he listened sometimes.'"
FCE_7,B2,"'Finding a Flat in Dublin Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way is to know someone who knows someone leaving a flat. But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you don't know anyone. So, you stay in a hostel and search for a flat. Jo felt Dublin was a big unknown place. She didn't think much about why she was going there. Everyone at her school thought they should leave their small town and see more of life. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, but Jo was the only one going to Dublin. Jo's mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel because it was safe. Her father worried it might be cold. Her sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo didn't know her family was still talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, 'Own room, own TV, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to the post office where she worked. Jo hoped it was nice and not too expensive. There was no line for this flat because it was more like 'Third Girl Wanted.' The 'own TV' part made Jo think it might be too fancy, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf was leaving and said to Jo, 'Desperate place. They're both awful.' Jo continued up the stairs. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'She just looked around, made a face, and said, ""Is this all?"" in a fancy voice. We wouldn't want her here, right, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt and had bright hair. Jo was surprised because Pauline was a punk. Jo had seen punks on O'Connell Street but never talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat.' Nessa said they were about to have tea. She had three mugs: one for 'Nessa,' one for 'Pauline,' and one for 'Other.' 'We'll put your name on it if you stay,' she said kindly.'"
FCE_43,B2,"'Dolphins and Their Problems People love dolphins. We like to see them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the problems dolphins face. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows do not show the real problems dolphins have in dirty and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down by up to 89,000. You might think dolphins are protected by law and live in safe places. But this is not true, and not helping them could be a big problem for wildlife. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. The first two live far out in the sea and are seen only in small groups. We do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only in Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few left have skin injuries, showing they are stressed. Dolphins have complex habits, making it hard to know why their numbers are going down. Overfishing is a big problem. It reduces fish stocks and threatens dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are taken by fishing, they may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. Modern fishing uses big nets that float or move fast in the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on them show they died from getting caught in nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can stay in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can eat them, and they build up in their bodies. Female dolphins can pass these poisons to their young through milk. There is a case of a young dolphin dying from its mother's milk. Another problem for dolphins is human noise. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise from ships and oil wells travels four times better than in the air. This noise may disturb dolphins in ways we do not know yet.'"
FCE_51,B2,"'GETTING FIT Exercise is very important for your mind and body. It helps you feel balanced when life is busy and stressful. You might think, ""Oh no, not another article about exercise!"" But there are many good reasons to exercise. Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit correctly, which is called good posture. Good posture prevents injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood circulation. You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored. But did you know exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems? It also helps control stress and can help with some medical conditions. There are many types of exercise like aerobics, jogging, and weightlifting. Be careful not to train too hard, as it can cause injuries. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are unsure. Good posture is important for how you look and feel. A stiff or slouching body can be unattractive and have less energy. Imagine a balloon pulling your head up to help you stand straight. This helps you breathe better and look slimmer. Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool down.'"
FCE_11,B2,"**In Their Natural Habitat**
Why do film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their comfortable homes for many months? They want to find the perfect picture. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is hard to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are now in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained for six months. This rain causes problems. Newman said they bought an expensive tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud. Amanda can then pull him out safely. Together, they have made some of TV's best wildlife films, like their famous film about leopards. Even when this film was on TV, they were back in Africa, looking for another shy animal, the jackal. 
Traveling film-makers have been going around the world to film wild animals since TV began. I talked to Newman at a safari lodge. He said they sometimes argue but solve it quickly. They do not see one as the leader. They both see animals in the same way. When they travel, they set up tents every night. But now, they have a fixed camp. They start at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before, keeping it warm in a flask. They eat pre-packed meals, heated by whoever is free. They can be away for up to eight weeks, so food can be a problem, says Newman. 
Living in remote areas is hard, but they can get close to animals. Newman remembers filming lions. One lioness would greet all the lions and their car too. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift'. Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. They spend four months filming for each half-hour film. Before starting, they need to get a script approved. Newman says they work well together because they share the same ideas. They want to make films that show the true spirit of the place and animals and touch people's hearts. Newman believes it is better to make people feel something than just think about it."
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.'
'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. She follows a strict plan to be very fit. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in our country. Playing here means more pressure. People expect us to start with a good game.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'We have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of skill.'
The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, there's only one chance,' says Kendra. In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. 'You train to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the game, we are all friendlier.'
Netball is now more scientific about fitness. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, she believes it's important to have a strong mind and lead by example. She supports and encourages her team. 'From the start, my netball career was planned,' she says. She decided this competition would be her last as a player. She might coach young players in the future, but now she focuses on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step."

This means she looks at the chemical processes in the sea. She is a teacher at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, like a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 'Inside,' she says, 'there is not much space. I can touch the two pilots. We can't stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and then three hours to go back up to the surface.' 'If there is a problem and we need to go up quickly, we can press a panic button. The outside part drops away, and a small escape vessel goes up fast, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but I think it would not be a nice trip.' 'I didn't know how I would feel the first time I got into the vehicle. It was on a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He showed me what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack! They wanted to see how I would react in a small space.' Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian team. 'We went to a place five days' sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, there are many underwater volcanoes, blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean is very active. The Russian team was putting some scientific equipment there to study the effect of a big project that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' When she is not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research into the ""black smokers"". This is another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.' 'The only time I was scared was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a big bang, and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. We were so relieved - we were still alive!' 'It's such an adventure diving to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the window and see those chimneys, I feel wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling.'"
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. People decide what they think about us in the first few minutes. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement, how fast or slow we talk, and our voice. Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best."" Many people forget how important it is to look professional. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a big company. When the office manager left, she applied for the job but didn't get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't look like an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I apply again. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't matter.""
Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from words, 38% from voice, and 55% from facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words are different, the listener will believe the facial expressions. So make sure your words and body language match. Mixed messages will confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to look too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went well, and she got the job right away. ""I was delighted,"" she says. ""But I showed too much excitement. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't say no. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have got more if I controlled my excitement.""
Finally, think about what you say and how you say it. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This will show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and speaking in short sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and clear points."""

FCE_6,B2,"'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I have always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Sadly, it did not get much media attention. I hoped to get sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there because the facilities and nightlife are great. But I must be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out before training, I say no. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to go to the next Olympics. That would be fantastic. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn. So, you cannot go to late-night parties. I do not mind that, but I love sleeping in, and I have to give that up too. It is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I have a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job on a TV surfing series. I guess I am a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate a win in style. People say we act childishly, but we do not look for media attention. Reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so it is nice to come home and hang out with friends. You cannot always think about the sport; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but I am rarely recognized on the street. I would not like to be a celebrity. I get nice letters asking for signed pictures, and I reply to all of them. It takes time, but it is worth it. D Tomas (tennis player) It is great to walk on the court and feel the crowd's support. At the last tournament, it got crazy with people crowding around. I still enjoy being noticed by fans when I am out shopping. But it has downsides. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you must make sacrifices in sports. You have to be serious and professional. I do not mind too much. I focus on my game now and will enjoy other things after I retire, which comes early in this sport.'"
FCE_33,B2,"'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not a sweet breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't buy all this, and I feel bad for saying no all the time. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make choices. I can't win."" Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why parents say no to buying things. They don't find reasons like ""sugar is bad for your teeth"" convincing when compared to fun TV ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children."" The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' the effect is the same."" Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son is critical of ads, and they look at labels together. She says, ""We don't have many arguments in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't buy."" Parents also say they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets for the kids because they're bad, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent."" Supermarkets could help by removing sweets from checkout areas or having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children are not with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring more customers.'"

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses a computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way. It cost £250,000 but will save money over time. For example, if a guest likes certain music CDs, they will have them ready on their next visit. 
Room temperature is important for guests. A special system lets guests change the temperature a little. The front desk can also change it more if needed. 
Business guests are important for the hotel. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and video-conferencing. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. TVs and DVD players can be updated easily.
The hotel has 145 large and comfortable rooms. There is a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. 
The food at the hotel is excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the hotel. This is good for both him and the hotel. He has a new kitchen and better parking. The hotel offers a great place to eat without financial risk.

I did it once with a concrete garden. I broke the concrete and added soil. It was better than exercise. I get energy when people want to read my writing. I also like walking in nature. If someone finds me, I say I didn't know it was private. It's fun and makes me feel young.' F. Katherine Monblot Therapist: 'You need to like and respect what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me active. Doing things you don't like makes you tired. I used to be on committees, but they took too much time. You have limited energy, so use it for important things.'"
FCE_45,B2,"'ICE SKATING Ice skating is a very old activity. People have been skating for thousands of years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until about the year 200 AD when iron skates came to Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was calm and stylish. But in 1924, at the Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie made skating more athletic. This made skating more popular. Today, skating is both an art and a sport. It is beautiful and hard work. For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster when you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees bent to keep your weight in the center. Lean a little forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It is not too hard, right? As you practice, you can make bigger movements. Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should learn. Even the best skaters fall. To fall safely, try to relax. This makes the fall less painful. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand. Once you can skate confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. But first, learn figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers to help you learn. You can soon learn the basic moves and then the turns, jumps, and spins of freestyle. Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, you should do exercises regularly. It is dangerous to skate with a stiff body. Warm-up exercises should include legs, back, and shoulders, especially ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness. Skating helps with balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It is good for your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. Skating with swimming or jogging is a great way to stay healthy and fit.'"

FCE_29,B2,"'We are all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is Britain's tallest man at 228 cm. Every ten years, people in Europe grow about one centimeter taller. More tall people are born each year. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. We are becoming like our ancestors, the Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago. In the past, people ate many different plants and animals. About 9,000 years ago, farming started, and people began eating mostly wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet made people less healthy. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Farming spread because it could support more people, even if they were not well-nourished. Now, in Europe, the US, and Japan, people eat better, like our ancestors did. The average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but it also causes problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, and there is less leg-room in planes and trains. Clothes makers have to change their products. We cannot grow forever. Scientists think we might reach an average height of 193 cm this century. But as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the planet gets warmer, we might become thinner and smaller. So, global warming might make us shrink.'"
FCE_57,B2,"'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV, but many people don't know much about them. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Some people think studio audiences are not very important. I heard that even TV workers don't respect them much. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be on TV for a short time. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of backgrounds. TV shows try to get different people for different shows. Some people like to watch TV at home and don't understand why others go to a studio. Why would someone get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio to watch something they can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came because she might be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But many people said they came because a friend gave them a ticket. Not many of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a difference between watching in a studio and at home? Claire thinks sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', and Charlotte liked being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night out.'"

Bruce  
I don't like wild places without people. I like places with people. It's the same when I travel. I like pretty villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to the village of Lastingham. It was in a nice valley. Riding my bike was fun and made me feel free. I liked to explore the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape was familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which I became famous for later.
Sophia  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by people who love trains. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive. The view is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the trip I like. The train goes through back gardens. We can see people doing things like making tea or washing dishes. I see myself as a woman in a small train, looking into other people's homes. I like the simple landscape. Just fields, sheep, and a faraway grey sea. It makes me look closely to find something new.
Matthew  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and quiet coast. The beaches are hard to get to and have many rocks, so not many people come here. Some brave surfers come, but most people like to look at the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips inland to valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple places with a family in the village of Southole.
Annette  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a big open area perfect for hiking. Not many people live or visit there. It is a quiet and empty place, and I like the space. I found it by accident when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.
James  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. We had a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's my dream place. It's a magic, quiet, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds.'"

I said, 'Yes, but only for one night.' We have a special tank for animals we find. One night is enough to look at them and read about them in our book. I came home late. I started cooking when I heard my sons shouting, 'Oh, Mother! Help!' I ran to their room. Domino, our cat, had Bianca, a white mouse, in his mouth. Bianca was a gift for Mother's Day. (Some mothers get perfume.) Domino ran around the room with the mouse. I tried to catch him but tripped and fell. Then I saw the snake. It was escaping from the tank. The room was full of noise: the cat, the mouse, the kids, and the dog barking. The pot boiled over in the kitchen, so I turned off the gas and came back. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse. The mouse was not hurt. Domino caught the same mouse three more times, but the mouse lived a long life. After saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It was hard to catch. I sat on the floor and waited. Slowly, the snake relaxed. I picked it up and took it to the garden. I wanted it to go to a tree. But when I let go, the snake went over my shoulders like a scarf. We stood there, me, the kids, and the snake. My eldest, DJ, said, 'Mum, you're warm, and the shed is not.' The kids helped the snake move to the tree. It climbed the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the tail vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, said, 'Wow, that was one big snake!'"
FCE_59,B2,"'Write me a letter! Today, we use phones, fax machines, and computers a lot. Because of this, writing letters is disappearing. But I think getting a letter is special. It is exciting to see a letter arrive, to see who sent it, and to read it. I have been writing letters all my life. I started with small notes to my mother. She always told me to write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote a letter every week to my mother, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote too, and his letters were funny and long. The letters from home talked about everyday things. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters more. I also got letters from boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we wrote letters to stay in touch. Writing letters made our relationships better. I could say things in writing that were hard to say in person. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but a letter with a lot of news is better! It's even better when it comes in an airmail envelope with pretty stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend I trained with 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. There is a lady from France who writes to me. We met in a restaurant on holiday. My husband took her photo, and I asked for her address. If she hadn't written back, we wouldn't be friends now. But she did, and now we write to each other often. I can practice my French because she doesn't speak English. We have visited each other too. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer. My family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but never met. Everyone was surprised that we wrote for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about it on the front page. I am happy my children also write letters. Like my mother, I tell them to write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, thanks to my penfriend. I think people should not stop writing letters. It is a special way to communicate.'"

Careless tourists damage old rock art
Many old pictures carved into rocks in France are being destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged quickly. They might not last for future generations. The mountain was once a place for prayer and worship. It has 4,000-year-old drawings of cows with horns, fields, and gods. But as more people visit, the pictures are being ruined by graffiti. Jean Clottes, from the International Committee on Rock Art, says, 'People think the pictures will always be there. But if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years.' He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and wearing away the rock. Some visitors even take parts of the rock home. 'When people can't take a good photo, they rub the drawings to see them better,' he said. 'The weather polishes the drawings, and if the sun is shining, visitors rub them to make them look fresher.' Other researchers say people scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts do not agree on how to save the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the only way is to stop people from going there, except on guided tours. He says if not, the site will be destroyed, and research will be reduced. Clottes disagrees. 'Henry de Lumley's idea is too strict and will cause protests,' he said. 'The site is a historic monument, and we must save it.' David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. 'Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,' he said. 'We want people to see the site, but it is hard to stop damage because the area is big. We don't have enough money for guards. We may need to charge a fee. There is no government funding.' In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach, damage will increase. She thinks the area should be roped off and guides provided. 'You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,' she said. 'That is not good enough. Money must be provided because this is a historic site. If we don't act, we will lose the drawings for the next generation.'"
FCE_32,B2,"'Shopping with Children Shopping with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not a sweet breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't buy all this, and I feel bad if I do. But I also feel bad if I say no all the time. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to choose things. I can't win."" Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number will probably grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why parents say no to buying things. They don't believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when they see fun and exciting ads. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children."" The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow ads to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Ask your mum to buy this,' that's what they want."" Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads. Her son listens to ads but is critical of them. They look at labels together, and now her children don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also say they are not always fair when they say no. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they are bad, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and children want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on my mood. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to be fair all the time."" Supermarkets could help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less if their children are not with them, but shopping without a child's demands might bring more customers.'"
FCE_65,B2,"'Climbing Walls In the past, climbers went to the mountains. Now, people can climb anywhere, inside or outside. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. The National Indoor Arena, where the event is held, is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both events have a wall for climbing. This is possible because of new technology. Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they climbed in cold places like Scotland or used buildings to stay fit. They needed strong fingers and wanted to avoid boredom. Sports centers started building climbing walls with special bricks. Don Robinson, a teacher, made a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete blocks. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s, but they had problems. They were only vertical, unlike real cliffs with different shapes. Also, climbers got bored because the walls couldn't change. In 1985, Francois Savigny from France made a new material for climbing holds. These could be put on and taken off walls easily. French companies also used steel frames to make climbing walls. These frames were lighter than concrete and could be set up anywhere. Climbers could change the holds for new challenges.'"
FCE_61,B2,"'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky'. Acting is a risky job because there are more actors than jobs. Some friends might say you are crazy, but others might not. Everyone will give different advice. It is your choice, and you must take responsibility for it. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee you will get a job after training. It depends on luck and talent. But there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous. Sometimes, it can also be rewarding. People often ask what talent is. I think it is natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. Talent also needs courage and belief in what you do. Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain. In theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is important in all acting. It is why actors love to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and others' skills, but they do not assume success will last. Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, selling clothes, or waitressing. Then, you get an audition, but you might not get the job. Actors do not talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes rejection. Remember, from the start, you might face rejection. You are saying you are ready and talented for the job. If you do not care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_5,B2,"'A Winning Game Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers with big beards, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are in their forties and remember their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing an old game called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, was a grocer from Quebec, Canada. He brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, the family played the game every weekend and holiday. Dave says they had 'the best time ever'. The family moved to New Mexico, but they still played the game. Grandpa's pichenotte board was made from old wooden food crates. Visitors were often interested because the game was unknown in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave saw the old board was broken and made a new one. It was very nice. A relative wanted one, then a friend wanted another. The brothers took a new board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. People watched and said, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" But soon, they couldn't stop playing! People asked about the game's history. Dave found out it started in India with a game called 'carroms'. It changed to 'squails' in Britain, and British people took it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version from Quebec. Pichenotte is a game of skill for two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks'. They 'flick' the pucks with their finger across a board. Flicking a puck into a small hole is 20 points. Three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. Eight small posts are obstacles. The game lasts about two minutes. The game was popular at the Santa Fe bar, so the brothers made more boards. They took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people liked the game, and it became more popular. Championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was made. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers started a business. They made a workshop in their garage and made over 450 boards. The boards are made of birchwood and mahogany, weigh 12kg, and are 1cm thick. Norm says, 'They're very strong because they need to last a long time.' The boards cost $595 each and are sold on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet.

FCE_41,B2,"'WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE When you enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just empty land with lots of bushes. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with help from his wife, changed it into the beautiful place you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to make the flat land into the nice shapes you see now. Machines helped, but there was also a lot of hard work. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tonnes of good soil were added to make the grass, flowers, and rock gardens. Many trees and bushes were planted. These plants had to be strong because the village is near the sea and has strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden shops, but some came from Canada and New Zealand. Colin Sims thought of the Model Village, and he made over 100 models in nine years. The village opened in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, special wood, and plastics to last in all weather. Colin learned from experts about how materials last in different weather, and he became an expert too. The models are all the same size compared to real life, and every small detail is important. The Model Village is very popular because of its high quality. The way the models are made is used in other model villages in England and is taught in some schools. The buildings in the village show traditional British styles. One of the best buildings is the Manor House, a 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It looks like manor houses in the West Country. As you walk around, you will see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is new. Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models; if you do, it can take hours to fix them. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. To enjoy the Model Village more, you can press buttons in front of some models to make them move. At the end of your visit, we would like to hear your thoughts.

She was in a hotel, a place where she should expect privacy, so she had a reason to complain, but she didn't. The PCC did not investigate, which is surprising. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not complain. Shouldn't the PCC do something about these attacks? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers and TV would report these decisions. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would stop publishing such pictures. Photographers would also be affected and might stop taking these pictures. If the PCC acted like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still did nothing, should it continue? Celebrities might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC watch all British newspapers and magazines? There is also the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want an investigation? Most people just want to forget and move on. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story they want to keep secret. Even the PCC might become the enemy. A British comedian was secretly photographed on his honeymoon. He didn't complain then or later when it happened again on a family holiday. He was afraid the newspaper would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this problem.'"
FCE_38,B2,"'There is a lot of advice for students leaving college and starting their first job. This article talks about moving to a second job. We are not talking about people looking for a second temporary job or those leaving a bad job quickly. We are talking about people who are taking a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and have an idea of what you want to do. What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. Do you want to specialize in a field, move up to higher responsibility, or change to a different field? Whatever you choose, pick your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in it for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. It should help you grow and give you more responsibility. If you want to travel, now is a good time. You can do temporary work when you come back and then find your second job. Future employers will be happy to see you have traveled and are ready to focus on your career. Juliette Davidson worked for three lawyers after leaving St. Aldate's College. It was a good first job because they were supportive. She learned about office work and improved her skills. But there was no chance to move up. So, she left, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. Now, Juliette is a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years, I have become more skilled and my job has grown,' she says. 'My boss wanted to help me develop. My job title is the same, but my duties have changed. I started with typing and phone work, but now I do most of the correspondence and budgets. I also handle different questions, from company chairmen to people starting their own business. Brenda involves me in her work and gives me projects and events to organize.'"
FCE_17,B2,"'Confident people - what's their secret? Confident people may look like they were born that way, but most say it's a skill they learned. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was scared, but I did well. Someone said I should go to university. I was nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life. B Michaela Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and acted too aggressive. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too hard, I don't feel bad if I finish tasks the next day. When things are difficult, I tell myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to forget my fears. C Lisa People think I'm confident, but when I look calm, I'm really scared. In TV, you must look confident. Interviewing people showed me that everyone gets nervous. My mother once said, 'Who's looking at you? Everyone worries about themselves.' I remember this. You gain confidence by doing things that scare you. I was nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt less scared. D Barbara My confidence comes from enjoying my work. I've built it over the years. If you learn from mistakes, you're more confident next time. I work hard and am liked in the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don't let it bother me. You must like yourself, not try to be what others want. My company has training courses that help my confidence. They also help us set small goals. It's better to achieve small things than aim too high and get nothing. E Kim After college, I worked as a secretary. In meetings, I was scared to speak. I finally got the confidence to speak up. In politics, I was nervous speaking in public. I told myself, 'People do this every day, so you can too.' I wrote notes to help me. Everyone is a little nervous speaking in public. The secret is to tell yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.''"

'You can keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and I have many more.' He showed me a pile of beautiful kites at his feet. All were 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a row of competitors waited to fly their kites. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person entered four different kites, judged on decoration, stability, and flying. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to fix his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur into the rainforest. I took a wrong turn and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. I saw a sign that said: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' It would have been good to know that most of this path was uphill and slippery. When I got there, a man named Baba was waiting with tea. He took care of a kitchen and bamboo huts. I decided to stay, trying not to think about insects under my mattress. The night was very dark and full of sounds. A waterfall was nearby and many animals made noises. In the morning, I saw a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First wind, then lightning hit the trees. I got very wet. Going downhill, I wondered how butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car being washed away. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' They were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I remember it for its kind people.'"

Children have fun and learn to make good food. Bill, who is ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made.' Flora, who is twelve, finds it hard to cut onions. 'I love cooking. I cooked for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum said I should have a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't sure at first. But now I'm happy I came.' Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun.

PET_49,B1,"'The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the colder south. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a train from Darwin to Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs. But there was often flooding, making it hard for trains to pass. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The train can go up to 115 kph, but it is not a high-speed train. There are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food is very good. The railway was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's south via Darwin and the train would save time and money. The Ghan says it is the world's first north-south railway. As I waited to get on the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited about the trip. Most of the travelers were older Australians. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the Ghan waited for four hours. Some passengers took a boat trip. I got off at Alice Springs and went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so we just walked around it and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop here. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and even if the train did not do everything the ads said, it took me to some of the most amazing places in Australia.'"
PET_31,B1,"'Climbing to the top of Britain Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time on Ben Nevis. It was February, my first big winter climb. We went up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is six hundred metres high - maybe the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls in the mountain walls halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need them because the snow is very hard, like ice. Even though some people in the group were very experienced, we took all kinds of safety equipment, like lights to get attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path soon went up, and my legs felt tired. I was the weakest in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but when I reached them, they started again. I promised myself to train better before a climb next time. After 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half metres wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. But we were not so lucky because there was mist. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was happy we took turns to do that job. That first time, I only felt happy when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top.'"
PET_58,B1,"Anna's New School
This week has been very exciting because we moved to our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like our old school. But this school is special because it is one of the first in my country to be very good for the environment. It took many months to build, so we watched it happen. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but it was sad to lose some nice open space. The building machines were very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building would never be finished.
Now, we have five big classrooms, much bigger than in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We are excited to use them when our new sports field is ready.
When you come into the school, you will see there are no heaters! The heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps all the heat inside, and it keeps the sound inside too. When we sing, it feels like we are in a concert hall!
Another interesting thing is the tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday. It spins very fast and is so big you can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on the website.
Even though we are using the school now, some parts are not finished yet. For example, we are doing a play for parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall for it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

Now, I looked down at the river far below and understood why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place to stay wasn't great, but we had what we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and didn't know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we weren't sure what we would do. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock-climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but happy and excited about what we did.'"

My purse had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do. I am 72 years old, I was far from home, and I was very worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong, and I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what happened, he said I should keep the fare. I got home safely, and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, with everything still inside. I want to say how wonderful everyone was who helped me that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty. Mrs. B. James, Newport'"
PET_60,B1,"'Sharks Sharks are some of the scariest animals in the ocean. They are good at finding food because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they almost never sleep. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving. This helps researchers who study sharks. It lets them learn more about these interesting animals.'"

I'm Nathalie. Last year, I joined the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. I was one of the youngest foreign students. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they spoke in English, so we could talk. Now, six months later, everyone is nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. 
For the first two weeks, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I was a bit sad. I called home late at night once because I felt lonely. The classes in Russia are very hard compared to my ballet school in England. I eat a lot to have enough energy. This makes me confident I can do well. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the film ends. Now, I feel at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was not very cold for that time of year! At least my room was warm and cozy.
Right now, we are preparing for a new show. There is also a competition for young dancers, and I will enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,B1,"'THE ICEHOTEL For many years, people visited the Arctic in the summer to see the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there with the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people thought winter could be special too. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit opened an art show in an igloo (a house made of snow) in Jukkasjarvi, a small town on the frozen Torne River. This place, called Arctic Hall, had many visitors. One night, some visitors decided to sleep in the Arctic Hall. They liked it very much, and this started the idea of an ice hotel. Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous around the world. When winter starts, snow builders, architects, and artists from many countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. As soon as one part is ready, it opens to visitors and guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December, and new parts open each week until January 7th, when the hotel is finished. The hotel is built outside with natural winter materials, so the finish date can change. In spring, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is always between -5°C and -8°C, even if it is colder outside. Warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves are included in the hotel stay. Guests should also bring sweaters, a scarf, and many wool socks. Shoes should be bigger than normal to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit, you can buy warm clothes and socks on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these when you book your visit, and they will be in your room when you arrive. The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.'"
PET_50,B1,"'Shopping for furniture A report by Dave Worthington Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It had to close soon after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people came to the shop. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours on the first day. However, it had to close in half an hour. A police officer said: 'The police knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter. They did not want to wait quietly. Also, there was a long line of cars trying to get to the car park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.' One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: 'I waited for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again.'"

PET_34,B1,"'Free-diving in the Caribbean Tanya Streeter has four world records in free-diving. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya Streeter became the first person to dive 120 metres deep and come back up without help. She had gone deeper a year before but used a balloon to come up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. She was the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people say free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents, but Tanya thinks safety and training are very important. Most free-divers focus on one or two events, but Tanya's training is always the same. She spends most of her time training on land at the gym. She also trains in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. When she practices diving, she often travels. She does fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important she does not get tired. When Tanya is not training, she appears in public to promote sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research or making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring rock pools to see sea life. She says her life now is like her childhood dreams. Tanya is famous in some countries, so people listen to her about the environment. Tanya is in her thirties and wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and does not plan to stop for many years.'"

In the late 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for children. But then, some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and children could enjoy cartoons. Not every cartoon film was a success. The Black Cauldron, for example, did not do well because it was too scary for children and too simple for adults. Directors learned from this, and film companies started making a lot of money again.'"

I had only acted at school, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I always wanted to play her. I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the part. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. Filming started a week after university began, so I got permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6.00am to write the essays I missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience. After university, I want to be an actress. I'm not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV roles but haven't got any offers yet. I don't know how I did it all, because I had a busy social life too. When filming finished, I didn't know what to do. I've been in two college plays since then.

In business, like in life, I need to enjoy myself, feel like a family, and be excited by surprises. I want the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.

Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey is usually milder in taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. Honey was very important to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as money. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research says it can help with tiredness and improve sports performance.

PET_7,B1,"'Norwich Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. People have lived there for more than two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By 1066, during the Norman invasion, it was one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city with a Royal Charter, which allowed it to govern itself. Today, Norwich is smaller than London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second largest city in England. It grew for 300 years and became rich, known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but the University of East Anglia was built in 1964. Norwich has many students and is a modern commercial centre, especially for insurance services. The city offers entertainment like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centres. Norwich also has a football team called 'The Canaries', with green and yellow colors. The city has a modern shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. Builders made a big hole in the city for over two years to create it. The roof of the Mall is now a city centre park with water pools and trees. People are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping centre. Both places are popular, showing that Norwich mixes old and new well.'"
PET_43,B1,"'The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, becomes full of bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event every year. The first festival was in 1972 for the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons, and they took off from a car park in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries are expected at the festival's current location outside the city. What to see The pilots talk to each other by radio and light up their balloons at the same time. These are called 'balloon glows' and are great for taking photos. You must arrive just after nightfall or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons come in all sizes and colors, some shaped like animals, cartoon characters, or famous products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies offering flights. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a view of the festival from above. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the first and last three nights of the festival. The Albuquerque Box This is a local wind pattern that is perfect for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This means that by going up or down, skilled pilots can control where their balloons go. Practical advice Buy your tickets in advance (they are available online) to avoid long lines at the festival. Wear several layers of thin clothing. At night and in the early morning, it can be cool, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are important. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, bring your camera. If you don't use a digital camera, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night pictures.'"

Margaret lives in London and likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who really want to learn. She started teaching the violin in 1972, and her first class was with her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson is one hour long, every two weeks. Also, each student has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important that parents are interested in the lessons. From the first lessons, students learn to play by listening. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for many years. There is a big difference between their playing and reading music for a long time. Margaret says her method is not to make great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin with more traditional methods."

Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer. The first song on the CD is a dance song, showing the band is not only playing slow songs now. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder. Most of the other songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two songs will surprise many fans. They could become hit singles because they are very good. Singer Rob Letchford sings perfectly on these songs. Fans should be happy he recorded them before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. (People who bought tickets do not need to worry because all the concerts will be rescheduled when Rob is better.) On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from slow to dance. I think the best songs are at the beginning, and the last few songs are not as good. Despite this, 'Here Again' will probably be a big hit and bring more success to the band.'"

They were young and old, fit and not fit. They wanted to lose weight, but I don't think they thought about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined hard training. They did not think about talking and smiling while running in nice places, like by a river. At first, they ran for only one minute. Now they can run for thirty minutes. They also learned about diet and fitness from other runners. I wanted to help women's running, and I have enjoyed watching them get better - almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves.'"
PET_40,B1,"'THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people went there to find gold and become rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew very fast and became the largest city in Alaska for a short time. In summer, boats could bring important things to these towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, so boats could not travel. In 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers and dogs could rest and eat. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when planes started to be used instead of dog teams. But in 1925, a disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, far away. Planes were new, and people were not sure if they could fly in the cold. Also, the best pilot, Carl Eielson, was not there. So, they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine. The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, from Norway, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. Balto saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero. Now, there is a dog sled race every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the 1925 route. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.'"

He noticed she was very fast. 'He talked to me about running. I didn't know what he meant. I only knew football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard, and my legs hurt.' But Jose talked to her parents and convinced them she could be successful and help the family. They agreed to let her go with him to train. In 1991, she finally went to train in the United States. She had said no before because she would miss her family. Her life was different from the girls she met in the US. She says, 'They were good athletes, but I worried about my parents having enough food, while they worried about dresses and make-up. They didn't know much about me or my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were great, and I learned a lot.' Today, Maria still runs and lives most of the year in South Africa with her mother.'"
PET_57,B1,"'The Skywalk The Grand Canyon in the United States was made by the Colorado River. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and mostly to see the view. The view is very beautiful, and the Skywalk makes it even better. The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform with glass walls and floor, so you can see the rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007, and many people have visited it since then. You must wear special covers on your shoes to keep the glass clean. Walking on the Skywalk feels like you are a bird flying high in the air.'"
PET_9,B1,"'THE ROCKIES The Rocky Mountains are a long group of mountains in North America. They start in the North-west and go down to the middle of the continent. The Rockies are smaller than the Alps, but they are still very beautiful. There are many roads in the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. You start from Vancouver, a very nice city in Canada. Vancouver is near the water and the mountains. People can ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. Before, thirty trains left Vancouver every day to go across the country. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still exciting. You sleep on the train, which is fun, but you see some of the best views at night.'"
PET_42,B1,"'ZOOS People started keeping animals in zoos over 3,000 years ago. The rulers of China opened a big zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many old zoos, animals had to perform for visitors. This does not happen now. Today, zoos are for people to see animals behaving naturally. Most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. But not everyone likes zoos. Some people think zoos are good because they help us learn about animals and nature. Without zoos, this would be hard. Other people do not like zoos because they think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also say that in some zoos, animals live in dirty places and eat bad food.'"
PET_59,B1,"'JAZZ By Katie Atkins, aged 14 I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different clothes, from black school uniforms like my band to bright T-shirts. We didn't look like adult professional bands, but we were used to playing in competitions, so the music was really good, especially because everyone was so young. Players from each band even made new tunes on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played! We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play can join - only about half can. But anyone who wants to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps around the country - I've been to a couple and learned a lot. Adults are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't hard enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find jazz exciting because it's both new and old - you can make your own music, but you also feel part of its history, playing on stage like great jazz performers before you. My school is really lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we wouldn't get far with our music!'"
PET_54,B1,"'Watering the Desert It can rain between November and March in Marrakesh, Morocco. It doesn't rain often, and when it does, the city's water pipes can't handle the sudden floods. The streets become like rivers. But, because many winters have been dry recently, people are happy when it rains. Marrakesh's parks and gardens are not green because of the rain. They are green because of underground channels. These channels were made in the 11th century. They bring water from the mountains all year. Dry places that get water this way are called oases. South of Marrakesh is Skoura. Here, people use every piece of land to grow food. They make small squares with water channels. The Atlas mountains, covered in snow in winter, are a beautiful background.'"
PET_32,B1,"Gareth Ellis
Gareth Ellis is 13 years old. He is the youngest son of Alan and Kath. Alan is an engineer, and Kath is a nursery teacher. Gareth has older brothers who work in banking and computers. But Gareth wants to be a clown. 
Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined the circus. Kath says, 'People laugh when we tell them, but it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since he was three years old when we took him to the circus.' 
When Alan lost his job, he and Kath looked for jobs in the circus. They both got jobs with a famous circus, and Gareth started training to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and come home in the winter. Gareth's brothers take care of the house when they are away. 
Kath says, 'It wasn't easy. We had a lot to think about. We only had a car and a small caravan to sleep in, and we left our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.'
Gareth says, 'People ask about my education, but everywhere we go, someone teaches me. I use the same books as my classmates at school, and I have a computer. I have never fallen behind.'
And the future? Kath says, 'It was a hard decision, but it was the only way for Gareth to learn to be a clown. I'm happy it's working, and we like it.' 
And Gareth? 'I will be the main clown in a circus one day,' he says, 'maybe Bippo's circus.'"
PET_52,B1,"'Eight-eighteen News Eight-eighteen News is a news group for young people. Our members are aged 8-18. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to big newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites. You can read or listen to our news on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three places in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more places. Our news group started in 1994 and was called 'Young News'. More than 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says: 'I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me about hip hop music. I was surprised by the chances they had. Age didn't matter, they did the stories by themselves. I went to the Eight-eighteen place in my city, got training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me do more than I thought. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19. Now, I am the youngest worker at a big news website, checking articles before they go online.' Get involved at every level When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and join meetings every month to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen helps members share skills. 'Peer trainers' are members who are 12 years old and over. They teach new members basic journalism skills. As they get better, some members teach young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. Older staff help them on these trips. Eight-eighteen News has training for new members three times a year. Our next training is in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen programme is good for children with all levels of reading and writing skills. Membership is free and there is no test to join.'"
PET_28,B1,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**
Welcome to our website. Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short Antarctic summer, we take tourists in a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, you can change the date if needed.
**Questions**
These are answers to common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.
**How long is the flight?**
The flight is about 12 hours. After four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back. On the way, experts who have lived in Antarctica talk about the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera near the pilot shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.
**Will I get a seat next to a window?**
All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you change to the seat on your second pass. Business and first class passengers have a window seat for half the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers have a window seat or a seat next to it for half the flight and an end of row seat for the other half. Over Antarctica, we encourage you to move around the plane to see the sights. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' so everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.
**What happens if the weather is bad?**
We have 17 different flight plans. Our captain checks the weather on the morning of the flight and chooses the best direction for clear views.
**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**
Most Antarctic animals live at sea level, over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we can't see them well. We do not land on Antarctica to protect the environment. To see Antarctic animals, you need to join a boat tour.
**Can I take photographs?**
Yes! You can bring your camera. We also have fun photo opportunities on the plane where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."

PET_5,B1,"'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be at the top of a hill. Ice might be under the melting snow, ready to make you slide off the road. The car coming towards you might suddenly slide across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick movements can make a car hard to control. So when you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you don't spill it. Rule Number Two is to watch what might happen. The more ice there is, the further you need to look down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times to avoid trouble.'"
PET_41,B1,"'Craigie Aitchison Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He went to London to study law, but he chose to go to art school instead. At art school, he found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. He liked early Italian artists, and this shows in his work. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colors in thin layers, from light to dark, but he says he never knows how it will look. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colors next to.' He never makes drawings before he starts a painting because he thinks he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why he likes models who don't ask to see their pictures while he is painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since he moved to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he does not want to follow any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters.'"
PET_38,B1,"'Rock Band Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, we did not like the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben said, 'and it will keep me out of trouble.' In the end, we agreed. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.' That was just the start. Because drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started coming to our home with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, the house is loud with their instruments and singing. At least Ben's hobby is good for our health: when the band starts playing, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must say that, although their music sounds a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good at music - after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music as I did when I was a teenager - but they do play often in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their music, though this hasn't happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.'"
PET_17,B1,"'Atlantic College Last week I visited Atlantic College, a great private school in Wales. It is special because it gives young people important experiences outside the classroom, and they can also study for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from all over the world. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do helpful activities like working on a farm, helping people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution. Atlantic College students come from many different countries and backgrounds. Not many can pay the PS20,000 fees for two years, so there are grants. A quarter of the students are British, and many of them get government help to attend. ""I really admire the college for trying to help young people understand each other,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don't like them. During the summer holidays, my mother saw that I argued less with my sister."" In short, Atlantic College gives its students a great education with methods that really work.'"
PET_47,B1,"'Being an older student I am 32 years old and I have just finished my first year at university. I go to lectures often, and I have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. I worked as a secretary and made good money, but I was bored because I did not have to think much. I felt sad because I thought I would stay in that job forever. I was jealous of the students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be like them. Now, as a student, it is hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, they know much more than I do. But I am happy to study because I need a qualification to get a good job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I like spending weekends with my books more than going to parties. I also enjoy student benefits like long holidays and discounts at the theatre and cinema. I sometimes worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good decision.'"
PET_48,B1,"'Henry Ford Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cheap cars for ordinary people. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. He soon sold 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant less choice. 'You can have any color you like,' said Henry Ford of the Model T, 'as long as it's black.' '"
