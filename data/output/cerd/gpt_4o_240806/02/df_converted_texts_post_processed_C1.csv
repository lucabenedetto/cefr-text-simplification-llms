CPE_15,C2,"Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy, but it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Rubbish bags or bins are collected regularly and taken to a landfill. Economists find this service strange because it is usually free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. More rubbish means more collectors and trucks are needed, and local authorities have to pay more for landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. The solution seems to be to charge households for the waste they produce. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming there are places to recycle. 
However, American economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this approach has complex and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is selling stickers or tags for rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected. In a study of Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents per bag, the number of bags fell by 37%. But this was mainly because people packed more rubbish into each bag, a method known as the 'Seattle stomp'. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14%, and in other Virginian cities without such a scheme, it fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people also resorted to illegal dumping to avoid paying. This is hard to measure, but it might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 
One positive outcome was a 15% increase in recycling, as people chose to recycle for free rather than pay for rubbish collection. However, this might not be due to the fee, as many were already recycling voluntarily. In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that pricing does reduce rubbish weight, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is lower than other studies, but not surprising. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. Other factors, like income and education, might be just as important. In wealthier towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 
Should we abandon the idea of charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and the results are not always pleasant."
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Are you respected and appreciated as you should be? Just having a successful career isn't enough anymore. Many professions feel undervalued, and even famous individuals often feel bitter. Loving your job used to be enough to make you special, but now you need to consider how your job affects you personally, your mind, character, and relationships. This is important because no matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to people outside your field, or if you're too busy to gain wisdom or use your imagination and humor, then status or money won't make up for your shortcomings as a person.
I am exploring how work can prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just shaping us for industrial needs. Work should be more than just creating wealth; it should be a meaningful lifestyle, helping us discover hidden talents and connect with more people. However, this doesn't mean eliminating unemployment, as educated people want jobs that are enriching and useful. A career should be like a work of art, with a fulfilled person at its center.
Even middle-class jobs aren't as appealing as they used to be. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, architects rarely use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, once proud of their status, are losing confidence. Companies and public institutions are downsizing, and strategies like decentralizing decisions and rewarding performance haven't gained employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees strongly feel their values match their organization's.
I am investigating various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I've studied how different cultures have expanded what humans can do and how courage can be developed. I've looked at happiness, love, friendship, and respect, and now I'm focusing on finding more satisfying ways to work. Many experts focus on extending the life and income of companies, but we also need to evaluate ourselves as people and decide who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, theoretically free to leave but actually trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to become better people but because we see no other choice?
Take hotel workers, for example, as 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. There's a lot of untapped potential. Many smart and lively people accept low prestige, low pay, and long hours because hotels haven't been rethought since the Ritz's 19th-century luxury model. A hotel isn't just a place to sleep; it's like a mini United Nations. People from around the world meet there but often don't interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they have shallow interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural hubs, connecting guests and the city, and bringing people together. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the students they employ instead of giving them only basic tasks. If they focused on their staff's true ambitions, they'd see many other services hotels could offer. But accountants often limit them, saying firms should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It's time to rethink this from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and move beyond traditional categories.
For me, work is about relationships. Now that many people want more than just obedience and see work as a way to express independence or personality, they should have the chance to design their jobs and choose their colleagues and even customers, within practical and profitable limits. This means they need to communicate beyond professional jargon, with minds that might seem different at first. Everyone knows communication is important, but it's different from conversation. Traditional conversation is different from the new kind of conversation people miss today. This is a more personal interaction that creates respect and helps understand others, possibly changing you. It's more than just relaxing; it's the best way to create equality. Every time you have a conversation like that, the world changes a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The term 'broadcasting' originally comes from agriculture, where it meant spreading seeds widely by hand. This metaphor suggests planned growth and a rich harvest if conditions are right. It implies a central source of seeds, or resources, meant for spreading and reproducing. The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fit this agricultural metaphor.
Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. However, from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. Broadcasting to private homes from a central source matched the socio-economic structures and lifestyles of modern societies. Other forms of organization were tried but remained just experiments.
Two lesser-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different social context. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Popular science magazines published articles on building TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards that pushed these grassroots efforts aside. This ended the chance for television to develop as a grassroots, egalitarian form of communication in Britain.
Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structures of modern societies. Despite TV amateurs' efforts, television in the USA in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public viewing, often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, public viewing was how most people experienced television. While grassroots, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, public viewing systems in several countries in the 1930s posed a potential threat to the domestic use of television. However, this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers saw the potential for mass sales of home TV sets once prices dropped. Given the division between public and private life in modernity, centralised broadcasting to homes was the most suitable organization.
As working-class people improved their living standards and joined 'consumer' society from the 1920s, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and culture became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now global. There is a link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, centralization and concentration of power increased, and traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, leaving them more isolated than in stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting helped governments efficiently reach citizens with important information and created a sense of national community.
These processes made broadcasting the dominant form of radio and television. However, broadcasting also played a positive role in democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If so, this metaphor will refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a centralised phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes the desire to get more things goes too far. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. It often suggests that if you don't own certain things, you're not as good as others. To see how much you're influenced by ads, try not to read any billboards next time you're out. These expensive ads constantly influence us in powerful ways without us noticing. We see them everywhere—on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, T-shirts, the internet—all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**  
Research centers and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature, sparking our curiosity and desire to learn. This has led to a lot of research. In places where caves have impacted our lives, studies have increased. However, exploring caves often requires physical skill, so cave research is not just for professors. There is a unique overlap between professional scientists and amateurs who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a technical science since the 17th century. Satellites and electronic tools now provide us with constant weather updates quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorological theory uses complex terms that can be confusing to non-experts. However, simple weather wisdom is still important. Human experience is crucial in turning computer data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can offer unique insights that help professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed opera was mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the most important part of opera. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor are the focus. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once the play starts, and the audience usually understands the language being spoken.
In musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, many people, like me, don't have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A brilliant singer or a perfect string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching an athletics match—we see athletes doing something similar to running for a bus, but much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems like what they could do themselves. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, although they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than music audiences; many are the same people. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play.
The question is, should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because a different approach can change the concert-goer's experience. Live music is naturally theatrical, full of emotion and drama, and it connects with the audience as a group. However, music presentations often emphasize the difference between performers and listeners, which can feel hierarchical. Also, audiences sometimes interrupt performances by applauding at the wrong times, which can disrupt the flow of the music.
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience that involved the audience directly, changing many people's lives.
I wish music had more of the risk and boldness that theatre can show. This can happen in unusual locations, where normal expectations are challenged. It can have surprising effects on both performers and audiences. Theatre audiences are used to following artists into unexpected spaces, even if it's uncomfortable.
Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. But I believe something should change in music conventions. I am just an enthusiast who loves theatre and music, and I want both to succeed so more people can enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
While I admire sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don't really like it in its natural form. To me, it's mostly an annoying barrier between a seaside car park and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your sandwiches, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you're wet, it sticks to you like plaster and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But here's the strange part: as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you. For days, you keep finding piles of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and more sand flies around when you remove your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. No, you can keep sand, as far as I'm concerned.
**Lock and Key**
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has been around since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind the door has evolved into an electronic lock activated by a plastic card with countless combinations. But the desire to keep out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people don't like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of turning a physical key in a lock. So, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the design.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I'd have opinions on more pieces. But you're not supposed to analyze it like a school essay. The idea is not to understand art but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery tries to give visitors a real understanding of the art. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that explained the context and meaning of the works. Instead of just staring blankly at the pictures, these bits of information helped me understand."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films often means cutting down, shortening, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers but also enlightening. When I worked on a script, I realized I could remove a lot of dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This doesn't mean the original text was unnecessary. It's about the different ways each medium engages the audience and uses repetition. In novels, repetition might include repeatedly mentioning character traits or using speech tags like ""he said."" These help readers understand the story better. In stage drama, which is mostly dialogue, real speech is imitated with some stylization. Some modern plays use so much redundant language that it seems like the dialogue is just for making contact between speakers, leaving the actual message unclear.
**Watching Movies**
Watching movies can transport you into the world of the film, making you feel like you're part of it. It's an experience that takes you away from reality for the duration of the movie. Once the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. People often don't feel responsible for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality means they might not take movies seriously. In the past, movies were seen as mere entertainment, not art, by some people, including our parents' generation and many teachers. They enjoyed being entertained but didn't consider movies to be an art form.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of different buildings. The layout was confusing and hard to understand. There were a few permanent landmarks like the Script Department, but most of the place was made up of small, similar rooms used for meetings. These rooms were identified by a strange system of numbers and letters, making it hard to find your way around. The studio didn't have a clear main entrance, which added to the confusion. There were three main entrances, all similar, and only one led to where you wanted to go. There was no place to ask for directions, making it difficult for newcomers. However, strangers were rare because the studio didn't encourage their presence. Employees, on the other hand, knew their way around and worked together to create films that offered audiences a break from everyday life.
**Film-makers**
Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses on the subject. Competitions offer cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make El Mariachi, a film that cost $7,000 and launched his career as a top independent director in America. Rodriguez's dreams came true quickly. In his book about making El Mariachi, he recalls thinking on his 23rd birthday: ""Orson Welles made Citizen Kane at 25. Spielberg made Jaws at 26. I have only a few years to make my breakthrough film."" In the past, filmmakers were expected to take time to develop their skills. They worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, and directed low-budget films to learn the craft. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, The Maltese Falcon. Fred Zinnemann, who directed High Noon, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to be independent and unconventional."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, council houses covered the western side of the city, with rows of cramped, dull homes made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, filled the air with a strong sulfur smell. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up to someone's front door. I've forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting, or maybe balancing, near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, I recall vague memories—faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
My mother often appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, though I never understood why she was angry or how to make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a crowded room as on a deserted moor. She also had a strict sense of propriety uncommon in West Earlham, which sometimes led to intense cleaning or handwashing and instructions to 'behave properly.' This moral code was beyond my understanding, and even now, I'm not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not walking into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes, sitting quietly in the dining room with hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother liked, and following countless other rules.
Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. It was only later that I realized how poor their company was, as they formed a gloomy group, talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children—a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy burden of West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to 'behave properly' weighed on me, and I felt I had to grow up quickly to escape it. This was easier said than done.
Growing up in West Earlham followed a set pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home, often getting in your parents' way. I remember aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile towards the city. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat, which were unusual contraptions with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey.
If I remember anything about those early years, it's the summer holidays, when you caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and a charity fete once at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity—a kind of junior charity, I think. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were 'only after your money.' She often talked about mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money from a gullible public. I might be exaggerating, but there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her.
To be fair, my mother did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my 'good clothes,' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. There, we would walk through rooms of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother wasn't entirely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions on the art. I remember her once stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This is the only time I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was thick with a light, prickly drizzle. This made my walk feel secretive and sheltered. I knew this side of the street well from my childhood. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first playmates, all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Each house was as familiar to me as the small grooves in the sidewalk that guided rainwater to the street. These grooves marked my path when I used roller skates or my scooter. As the street sloped down, the houses seemed to reflect a slight drop in social status: the porches were closer to the ground, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, changes occurred: wooden porch railings and pillars were replaced with wrought iron in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had turned back into homes. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops, with the lingering smells of merchandise.
**Bachelor Fads**
Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brickwork and large doors, which were once used to bring in curtains from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn't want an open-plan space for practical and aesthetic reasons. In his previous home, his living and working areas were combined, making it hard to separate work from relaxation. So, he divided the space near the entrance with a large sheet of corrugated plastic. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. Gilbert wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could either cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he used light wood for the floors. While his flat has futuristic chairs and sofas, it also contains sentimental and homely furniture from his parents or bought from markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Was Bruce Chatwin's life about escaping or exploring? This question has puzzled many. Chatwin's life and work were full of secrets, subtle connections, and sometimes lies. Despite this, he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed travel writing, with the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of extraordinary literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction. He would change or even ignore reality to make a story more interesting or to get to the heart of what the book seemed to suggest: that through travel, one could discover entire histories that seemed to exist just to captivate future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rainstorm, I hurried across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and then burst. The best moments were when the storm grew stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was during this intense rain in the summer of 1996 that I started thinking about a long swim through Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, breaking free from the routine of swimming laps and turning back on myself like a caged tiger. Most of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes reality seem more like a visual experience. Walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities because they help us reconnect with what is old and wild by getting off the beaten path and escaping the official version of things. A swimming journey would let me explore parts of the world that, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains, still hold mystery."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin believed that crying had no clear evolutionary purpose, but he was likely mistaken. Scientists now suggest that crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby noted that crying helps build the bond between a mother and her child. Many think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. However, why adults continue to cry is more difficult to understand. In adults, the visual signal of tears seems more important than the sound of crying. Crying might have helped early human groups by building trust and social connections. Tears can also have other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear inspiring music or speeches. We might cry during a sentimental movie, and this often happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We've all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect us? Most people know something about global warming, but its exact consequences are uncertain. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans rely on these natural resources to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are important.
The challenge is understanding how the world will change and what causes these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict the future.
We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed along with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.
Researchers use computer models called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict future climate conditions. These models use physics and chemistry to analyze factors like temperature and solar radiation. However, they simplify the real world and have limitations, making their predictions only approximate. Despite these challenges, most agree that climate change will happen faster than ever before.
GCMs predict that by 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15-95 cm, and precipitation patterns could change. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common. These changes could significantly impact the environment and human life.
Climate change could alter the locations of ecosystems like forests and grasslands, affecting the species they contain and the benefits they provide to society. Resources like food, water, and human settlements are sensitive to climate changes. While some effects might be beneficial, many are likely to be harmful. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields by reducing frost damage. However, climate change could also reduce water availability, especially in dry regions or areas with existing shortages, like the Mediterranean Basin.
Glacial changes could affect ice, vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making marine transport easier but increasing iceberg risks. The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels due to ocean expansion and melting ice. With about half the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could cause severe flooding and displacement. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face significant disruptions, and many people might become environmental refugees. Small island nations could be most affected, potentially disappearing if worst-case scenarios occur, leading to devastating consequences for their people and cultures."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts to go to Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without using more fuel, as saving fuel is important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch is in 2031. It's a big challenge, and the race is on to create systems with new technologies. If these can be developed in time, the spacecraft might make it. But even if it doesn't launch, the efforts to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable, as they will lead to important advances for future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"AESTHETICS
Ironically, the very existence of art, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can sometimes hinder our understanding of it. This is because art is often seen as just physical objects like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from human experience. However, the true essence of art lies in what it does to our experiences. This misunderstanding can block our understanding of art.
Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some art pieces create conventions that prevent new insights. Once an art piece becomes a classic, it often gets disconnected from the human conditions that created it and the effects it has on our lives. This separation builds a barrier around art, making it hard to understand its broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory tries to address. Art is often placed in a separate realm, disconnected from other human efforts and achievements.
Therefore, a key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. Just like mountain peaks are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how mountains are connected to the earth. Similarly, those who study art should show how it connects to human life.
If we accept this idea, even temporarily, we realize something surprising: to understand art, we need to step away from it for a while and look at ordinary experiences that we don't usually consider aesthetic. We need to approach art theory indirectly. Understanding art is about gaining insight. Just as one can enjoy flowers without knowing plant biology, understanding flowers requires knowledge of soil, air, water, and sunlight. Similarly, to understand art in its refined forms, we must start with raw experiences that capture our attention and provide enjoyment.
However, many people are put off by the idea that their everyday activities have aesthetic value. The arts that resonate most with people today are often not seen as art, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyable experiences in their daily lives. Even those who criticize the museum view of art often share the misconception that art is separate from ordinary life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to everyday activities."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
In our imagination, lions hunting for food look like a well-coordinated team: as the sun sets, a group of sneaky lions jumps out from the shadows and surrounds their prey. Lions seem like perfect social animals, working together without any arguments to achieve a common goal - getting their next meal. However, after many years of watching these animals in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare off rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then being too cooperative might not be beneficial: if an animal is too generous, others benefit at its expense. So, why don't the evolutionary rules of self-interest apply to lions? We thought we could solve this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. If there were a list of inactive elements like krypton, argon, and neon, we would add lions to it. Therefore, it has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to get clear answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a major event for the band, which had been talented but unstable. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. The serious and plain style of the past, with loud guitars, was replaced by a lighter mix of melodic local styles. The album combined social commentary and strong emotions with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, as were voices that didn't hide their origins. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, and a clever team of songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its gentle, sad songs like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is rare in the era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, and she burned three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He bought the last three for the full 300 gold pieces. Even then, I understood there was a deep truth in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that other kids would want to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I've never forgotten. When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I was interested in, something relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveler - I sent my editor a long list of places I didn't want to go. In the end, I'm only interested in ruins because I like traveling through time in my mind.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting to be sorted - the so-called slush pile. The person sorting it is usually a junior in the editorial department or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much influence, but they want to find something original - the junior to make a name for themselves and find an author, the freelancer to keep their job. If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed at an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales, and also consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). They will also consider how promotable you are, which is important when a new novel needs all the help it can get. Publishers often like to meet a potential author before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you worked in an advertising agency during the early 1990s, you probably faced one of the toughest times in your career. The economic recession was severe, lasting longer and hitting harder than expected, especially in industrialized countries. In Britain, 1991 was particularly difficult: the economy shrank, interest rates were high, consumer spending dropped, over half a million people lost their jobs, and many homes were repossessed. Every business felt the impact, with industries like vehicle and construction seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies across different countries suffered.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who remained employed felt significant pressure. They were expected to help boost company profits and were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also had to work with smaller budgets, being told to achieve more with less. Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on producing what customers wanted rather than just what was convenient for them. This shift meant marketing activities received more attention from management, raising the status of marketing professionals but also increasing their responsibilities.
Marketing was often seen as a solution to all problems, and since about half of marketing budgets went to advertising, the pressure was on advertising professionals. The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought a downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because companies started questioning the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money and whether it was worth the investment. Advertising, always viewed with some skepticism, was now under more scrutiny than ever.
Companies demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to produce outstanding work. This meant that advertising professionals faced the same challenge as their clients: doing more with less. The recession made it difficult to produce effective advertising, as companies were hesitant to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising.
Other challenges included demographic changes, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, stricter legal restrictions on advertising, and the challenge of advertising internationally. These factors, along with the economic situation, forced advertisers to reconsider the effectiveness of their work. The pressure to make advertising more effective was higher than ever.
Unfortunately, help for those trying to improve their advertising was not readily available. Companies and agencies were too busy dealing with the situation to share their insights, and those who succeeded were reluctant to reveal their secrets. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising often failed to provide practical guidance. They tended to overestimate the quality and value of advertising work, which did not help those responsible for making advertising decisions."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking wasn't a popular career choice. On the surface, being a chef seems unattractive. Chefs have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. But these factors didn't discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed-off and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from this. It offered a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. My desire to cook wasn't just a reaction to being a student. It also represented an artistic ideal for me. I first saw this ideal when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was eye-opening. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt like I wanted to thank the chef deeply. I felt happy and light for days. After this experience, I wanted to learn the secrets of this amazing art. I turned my student life into preparation for entering the culinary world. My history degree felt empty, distracting me from my real passion. I learned about cooking in a random and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, visiting markets and delicatessens, and making elaborate meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he criticized me: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes!' The following week, I went up to the high board. It was a fixed board, and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt like I was in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disapproval and shook his head. But even he couldn't take away my joy. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird,' I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living at least until tomorrow, the idea of the traveller is both puzzling and fascinating. These are people who are drawn to the dangerous allure of the unknown, who choose to risk their lives by climbing icy, avalanche-prone mountains; who sail alone in fragile boats through huge waves; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing better is available, and who can live for months in the shadow and promise of the unknown. It's easy to dismiss such people as oddities, which they are, and to categorize them with the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers, or writers. They exist, but the strange, uncomfortable world they inhabit is far from our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, grateful that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, like running across a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his natural environment, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't claim to be a top sailor, though he is clearly competent. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides plenty of challenges and achievements for him to write about. Raban's small boat has an electronic device that gives sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, Raban has a somewhat old-fashioned view of other sailing aids. He believes the invention of the compass was a mistake, causing a 'fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea.' Raban argues that since the compass came into use about a thousand years ago, it has become the main focus for sailors, meaning they no longer need to study the waves and feel the sea. The ocean, once full of activity, is now just a space. Since the helmsman's job is just to stay on course, he can be replaced for long periods by an autopilot. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books help us feel more connected to the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books from long ago or faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are people. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts with clarity we can't achieve. What is unclear in us is clearly expressed in their words, especially if the book is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Through reading and travel, we break free from routine. Our eyes are most open in a new place, or when reading a great book, which shows us things we ignored before. Our mind becomes aware of new details, like the sky's colors, a friend's hypocrisy, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I've restored some small cuts made by the editor to fit the page, but added little else. I've corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were details I should have gotten right. I could have made more improvements with hindsight, but that process would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would seem like I had foresight, which I didn't. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, unaware of the future, trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of mass travel: the world opening up to people with no qualifications except the price of a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers aren't blind. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for overused tourism phrases, 'ecotourism' would win. The term appeared in the early 1980s, as people became more environmentally aware and tour operators realized travelers wanted to avoid negative impacts. It quickly became a popular marketing term. Now, 'ecotourism' includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour involving culture, nature, wildlife, or adventure is labeled as ecotourism. The original motives were good, aiming to help people make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my Transylvanian journey for 50 years, but found it by luck a few years ago. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, moving from one welcoming house to another, often staying for weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes only made brief notes instead of detailed stories. Worried that details might be out of order, I added many disclaimers. But then I realized this wasn't a guidebook, so I let the story unfold naturally."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern trend, linked to the capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians emphasize that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start with the rise of markets and trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing and accessories have been developed, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing or accessory means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very uniform, can have different meanings in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Reports of publishers fighting over promising manuscripts have given a false impression of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us not topping the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest among us write in the evenings and have full-time jobs that are secure even if the book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various literary jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles like this one. I've heard of writing jobs at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by juggling part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the generosity of people mentioned in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues we were performing at across the country started selling out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of screaming fans. We had to use secret entrances to the places we played to avoid being mobbed. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, this was replaced by a strange over-confidence that only naturally shy people in similar situations can understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Challenges**
Technological advances are changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians have decreased. It's clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. Music is essential for national events and personal activities, both formal and informal. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn musical instruments.
I believe people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of Britain's economy, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media. Besides job opportunities, playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. Although these findings need more support, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children, including those with behavioral issues. Further research is exploring if playing an instrument can help develop skills that can be used in other areas, like good study habits and organization.
In the short term, there will likely be a demand for music lessons. But what about the long term? I see two possible trends. First, people will listen to more diverse music, with new genres mixing different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. This might reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on performing. At the same time, more people of all ages might want to participate in music-making, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions.
To prepare for this future, the music profession needs to adapt. Instrumental teaching should change to allow more people to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, requiring them to be relevant to a wider audience and cover more musical skills. Training musicians will be key. They need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and have communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This is a big shift from traditional methods and will require accountability. Positively, it offers a chance to show the quality of music education.
Finally, we need to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is crucial but often overlooked. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors often face criticism and mockery. This is partly because they sometimes talk about their work in interviews, which can lead to clichés or gossip. They could learn from dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" when asked about her dancing. Paul Scofield, a respected actor, once wrote that acting only has meaning when performed. Discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. Each new play is a fresh start for an actor, who learns and grows with the characters and the writer's insights. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next role. This emptiness is evident in any discussion about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a balance between youth and adulthood, showing simplicity and confidence. His skill with the text and his control make him a standout actor. Lester portrays Hamlet as a tense young man with hidden anger, using sharp wit and humor to be both intimidating and charming. His performance is subtle yet impressive. His body language, like his stiff arms, suggests a character ready to come to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio shows a character moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting and behavior: Is acting an imitation or a creation of real behavior? What drives these characters, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theater.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager projects the script on a screen. Actors listen quietly to others, noticing the effect of the words. When it's their turn, they read a phrase, think about its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, with the line ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe, let the thought sink in, and visualize a scene, like waiting in line for a concert. They find the impulse to speak, which the director calls ""The pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should look into each other's eyes and consider their character's situation. The director encourages actors to approach with an open mind and trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theater should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and the staff should recognize this. It's discouraging if the staff treats it like just another job. The theater should create a connection between the performer and the audience. No one should feel too far away; they should be able to hear, see, and feel connected to the stage. The auditorium's size is important; it should suit the human voice and body. If it overwhelms the actors, it's not right. Many theaters from the late 19th century got this right, creating spaces that embrace the stage. I like theaters with a sense of history, like worn steps in a church, showing layers of human presence. You can't please everyone with a play. Audiences don't always know what they want to see. When you go to the theater, you want to experience something unexpected, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular among young people, but its real significance was the big impact it had on middle-class and older people. It also set the stage for the next wave of rock stars, who listened to it with amazement, knowing that this new, exciting music would be a big part of their future. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the main way to hear this fresh and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many future rock stars. Just like young John Lennon, who was in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only place in Europe to hear the new rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from just listening to making his own music.
**Snow**
There was no clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow, which looked harmless, collapsed under me. I fell, surprised, into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had created a roof over a gap between two rocks, which had melted away, leaving only a thin layer that I broke through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried, thinking about what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against the top of a pine tree sticking out of the snow to assess the situation. In an hour, I had only covered about half a mile. It was clear that I needed to give up my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books now that try to guide researchers on qualitative research. While a lot has been written about collecting data, these books often don't talk much about how to analyze the data. There is a lot of mystery around how researchers analyze their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative projects to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share insights and understanding of the process of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This involves making hidden procedures more clear. While this might seem easy, we found it quite challenging. We allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
Recently, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a strange way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce, saying, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show he had watched. When I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, he didn't recall much. Nowadays, many people are eager to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son's noodle game, is a medium that suggests ideas rather than teaches them directly. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is dialogue with teachers or parents. Technology can be useful for teaching, but formal education still plays a crucial role.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local residents were not happy, seeing their area of Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, in the end, they accepted it because of the success it brought. In Hollywood, success is measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that might make a star but will definitely make money. In less than a century, Hollywood transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it remains like a village, with a narrow focus on films. People there talk about how much films have made, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Successful people often try to leave, preferring to work there but live elsewhere. Still, Hollywood is the place where almost everyone in show business eventually goes.
**Photography**
Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new art form. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of their surroundings, and they found it with photography. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and a chemical-coated surface produced images that were more lasting and detailed than paintings. This caused concern among other artists, and art critics argued that photography was not true art. They believed that because photography relied on mechanical means, it couldn't be considered a product of human creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers knew they had discovered a new form of art. They used photography to interpret the world and present their vision of nature and people, just as other artists used brushes and pencils.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations, even novels for older readers. However, as print runs became shorter, this practice declined. Children's publishing was active but often operated on a low budget, leading to a mix of routine and mediocre work. Still, the best artists always delivered high-quality work. The black-and-white illustrations from this period are a mix of junk and treasures, offering a rich area for research and discovery. The true treasures are likely to be showcased again, either through reissues of books or exhibitions of original works. There are signs that interest in this period is returning, and publishers may soon see the potential for reprinting classic children's book illustrations or creating new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing Your Life Online**
A while back, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone where you are online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers huge opportunities to share every part of our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. 
Feeling down? Don't be. There's a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the online world and faced its challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame—long before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While his work was exhibitionist, it also had a certain beauty that some might even call art.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is exciting, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be let down.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and wealthy countries, more people are experiencing sleeplessness and anxiety. In the USA, research shows that 40 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. In Britain, some popular novels feature characters who can't sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, and its problems. A main concern is that people need more sleep. A leading sleep researcher says, 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They wake up too early to avoid traffic.' 
A sleep researcher conducted an experiment where he let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to settle at about eight-and-a-quarter hours of sleep, showing they needed to catch up on lost sleep. In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands tests these ideas. They study things like how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They find volunteers through student newspapers, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab is more interested in physical effects.
In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants come at 2 pm, when people naturally feel sleepy, after a short or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. Young men often say they won't fall asleep, but Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he sits upright, eyes open. Then he starts blinking more and more, his head nodding. Each nod gets heavier, and the blinks turn into 10-second blackouts. He wakes up suddenly, but by then, the car has veered off the road. A coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for over half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests using alertness products like tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. During sleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, there are theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain's creative part. But these might also happen when awake and relaxed, so it's uncertain. Scientists are sure women sleep half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why.
When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, 'Sleep is a way to pass time safely.' Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had different sleep routines. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight for an hour, and then had a 'morning sleep.' This break was a time for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest benefited most from this quiet time, free from daily work. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping in one long stretch, which was more efficient. The industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, changing sleep patterns for everyone except some rural people. Outside Europe and America, the old pattern was common until recently. In some non-western cultures, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up. Continuous sleep is not the norm. In some tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for danger make uninterrupted sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"'We're talking about really big cowboy boots here. Expensive ones. I was standing in my $800 designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money wasn't an issue. I wore the full cowboy outfit, thinking it might make me feel like a cowboy. But it didn't. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver just after dawn, feeling like I might pass as a cowboy from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty bag off the conveyor belt. He noticed my new boots, raised an eyebrow, and walked away without a word. 
I wished there was an outfit for an ex-racing driver that made me feel like I fit in. Something that made me feel like I wasn't out of place. I loved being a racing driver, driving fast cars. I'm addicted to it, and it's all I know. But I don't do it anymore. I can't, even if I wanted to. So, I wondered, looking at the distant mountains, what do I do now? A racing driver should have a backup plan for when they stop racing. I thought I had one, but it vanished when I needed it. 
How about becoming a commentator at the racetrack? 'We have fifteen former drivers ahead of you, Forrest, waiting to be commentators. We'll call you.' Or maybe selling classic cars? That idea lasted almost all winter with meetings and phone calls. But it was a bad year for selling old Ferraris, and Honda was reconsidering its dealers. So, I backed out before there was nothing left. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? Nobody likes a story that ends with 'almost'. Even if I had been champion, people would only listen for a few minutes. Last year's champion is old news. 
I don't want sympathy, and I don't get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and kept enough. But I miss the thrill of driving those powerful cars. Going from zero to 150 miles per hour in 4.9 seconds. I miss the danger and the excitement. I miss the interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being a little famous wasn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Kids wanted my autograph. But now that I don't race... Last week, the phone rang only twice. I have a lot of free time now. 
I looked up at the blue sky. No buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But there were some small birds in a cactus nearby, singing as if to tell me to leave. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in designer boots has a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the past decade, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, located in western Canada. In the evenings, locals enjoy walking through the city streets, and if you join them, you'll likely hear a variety of languages. People are attracted to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and opportunities for education and work. Although some people complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it's clear that the influx of new residents and a booming tourism industry have contributed to the city's revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. While the name is less popular now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists, like myself, often aren't great at writing personal letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think we're that focused on money. It's more likely that, since we're always trying to make a big impact in our work, we lose the natural flow needed for a letter. True creative artists, who don't consciously focus on the effect of their words (even if they rewrite a passage many times), don't have this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is what truly defines a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't consciously think about how the mix of long words made them powerful, yet it showed his greatness as a writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. You could expect a soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal to cut the ribbon. Nowadays, new supermarkets open so frequently that celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were first in line. According to a customer who knew an employee, the first five men would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel pleased and those who arrived later feel envious."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was finally released in 1941, it faced a lot of controversy. The release was delayed because distributors were worried about the reaction of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film. Despite receiving mostly excellent reviews, the film was not a commercial hit. It was television that later brought it back to public attention. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most influential film, inspiring many to become filmmakers. This is especially surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said its success came from not knowing what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon similar to Hearst, Welles saw it as a perfect opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot noticed that Carmel seemed a bit strange that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Both times, Carmel nodded as if she wasn't really listening. ""Will you be okay? What are you planning to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I mentioned, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.
**Title Race**
Human nature can be quite amusing. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and tension at work. A survey by a top recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would prefer a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title over a pay raise. If our desire for impressive titles is so strong that it outweighs even the basic desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. In today's world, no one wants to be seen as inferior. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways of saying the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"I was in Vienna to take photographs. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light could change a scene and how a single photo could capture the essence of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. I once got lucky with a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well, which became famous worldwide. After that, I decided to work freelance, but things didn't go as planned. The mid-nineties weren't as successful as I had hoped, even though my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more newsworthy. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which was fine by me.
The Vienna assignment came by chance. I had taken photos for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had captured different seasons in London and was ready to move on. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna project, and they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the other photographers. I was happy to go because things at home weren't great. A week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.
They put me up at the Europa Hotel in the heart of the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife during a busy summer, but this time was different. As soon as I arrived, I felt inspired by the snowy city. On the first day, I didn't take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the city, getting a feel for the place. I wanted this to be my Vienna, not Schussner's. I waited for the right moment to take my photos.
The next morning, I was out at dawn. Fresh snow had covered Stephansplatz, making it look untouched and empty. I struggled to capture the cathedral in one shot because its spire was so tall, and the base was massive. I realized I might have to settle for a partial view, but it could still be magical. Photography has always had a magical quality, even for the pioneers in the 19th century. Watching a photo develop in a dark room is mysterious, and that sense of wonder never goes away. So, when something unexpected happened at Stephansplatz that morning, I wasn't entirely surprised."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**
Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place of wonder, not because of a big-budget show, but thanks to a unique exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an important, though often overlooked, part of 20th-century art. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for many years, has put together a collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are displayed without much explanation, allowing visitors to make their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art is popular with many people, even those who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might be drawn to Hockney's personality and humor, which make him a favorite in the media. Critics sometimes say Hockney is overrated, but this might be because being popular is not always seen as a good thing. Hockney himself knows his limits and doesn't claim to be a great artist. He believes that only time will tell how his work is judged.
**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**
I've seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some great and some not so much. What bothers me are shows that try to push a certain idea or trend among artists. Sometimes this works, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to do something different. I worked with seven artists to create an exhibition in an empty warehouse called 'Window-shopping.' The artworks were connected only by the fact that they were art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera experiment flickered on a monitor. These works didn't fit into a specific theme, but they complemented each other through their differences. I didn't make any big statements about contemporary art, but that's okay because art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who love paintings sometimes avoid analyzing them because they think it might ruin their experience. Some say that art historians focus too much on theory and ignore the joy of simply looking at art. This is like saying that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. Understanding more about art can actually enhance our enjoyment. Pleasure is complex, and how we experience it can be influenced by the society we live in. While it's important to appreciate the sensory experience of art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from its enjoyment is outdated. Art can be both a sensory and intellectual experience."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, when one of our early ancestors found a shiny yellow pebble. It didn't feel like a regular stone, but it was attractive. This is how gold might have become part of their lives. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have been discovered by accident too. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they eagerly searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This is how metalworking became one of the skills that improved their lives.
**St Ives**
We walked silently, carrying our bags down the winding, cobbled street leading to the town center. We struggled against the strong wind and tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and the shutters on every waterfront cottage were tightly closed against the storm. We had watched the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small single-track train. As the dark grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn't seem like such a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of beautiful coastal walks and cozy evenings by open fires.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived through peaceful times and hardships are long dead. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families, clans, villages, and cities are forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We can't replay history. However, computer modelling offers a solution. It allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and fill them with virtual communities—digital versions of humans with some real-world needs and abilities. We can set rules for behavior and create social groups. Then, we can change conditions, like reducing rainfall or increasing population, and observe how this digital society reacts."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth observed a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To prevent this, the dominant male used a clever trick. Whenever the stranger tried to approach, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. The trick worked until the dominant male made a mistake: he gave the alarm call while casually walking in the open, revealing his deception.
**What Cats Catch**
In the English village of Felmersham, residents collected prey caught by their cats. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor estimated that, based on these numbers, cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this calculation is misleading because most cats live in towns and catch fewer prey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes, as many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations high. The survey showed that cats are significant predators but not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people and are well cared for. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area slowly and with groans, heading to the reed beds. They stand at the edge, complaining about the day's work, until the leader moves into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and rest there for a while. Eventually, they start moving so slowly that it's hard to notice. They swim with just their noses above water, looking exhausted. They spend the day among the reeds, eating leisurely.
**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles, 1940**
In early 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. The fish and crab look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and soft colors, creating a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension, as the fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp forms and even a chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a symbolic meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography has been a tool for capturing human life and activities for the past 150 years. In this short time, it has grown to capture moments in time and space, allowing us to see both fleeting moments and vast or tiny details. Photography has shown us images from faraway places on Earth and in space, as well as the complexities and crises of modern life. It has become a powerful way to express the human experience.
However, using images to record events is not new. The earliest examples date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early humans created cave paintings—whether to record hunting events, as magic to increase animals for hunting, as religious symbols, or simply to decorate their living spaces. But images have always been a part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and their importance in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given visual images a special status. When photography was invented in the mid-19th century, it promised to provide a truthful visual record automatically. The camera, like the human eye, was seen as a tool that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This was a major achievement, as artists had long worked to develop the skills to create such images.
Photography was thought to be a ""universal language"" that everyone could understand. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even isolated people could understand a photograph of the sky. But as global communication increased in the late 20th century, we began to question whether photography could truly cross cultural differences. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as language is? Our familiarity with photographs might make us overlook the medium's ability to convey reality.
Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between reality and its photographic representation. It's common for someone to show a photo and say, ""this is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and attitudes towards it have changed significantly. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming part of ""mythic time,"" where images have become historical documents revealing much about the people and society that created them.
The camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography can inspire social and political change. Just as the development of perspective was crucial to the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance, photography has played a key role in shaping the media culture of our time. It also brings the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives, like on a coffee table."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching someone how to write poetry is tricky. It's like walking through a minefield: you need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can ruin everything. Claiming to know everything about poetry is risky, so instead, I suggest that beginners should read a lot, write often, and let their imagination and spirit run free, as long as it doesn't lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write a poem, while others can write even when they're unhappy. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid, as long as they aren't just copying someone else's rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used if necessary to explain something. A good way to do this is through a quick memory in the main character's mind, which can help move the story forward. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly and keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but that doesn't mean it should be as short as a summary. A short story needs to have conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must be important because of the limited space.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. Many chess players don't know much, but they know enough to play. They make moves without knowing what will happen next. Over time, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the whole game, not just individual moves. In chess, as in screenwriting, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin once said that humans naturally speak, as we see in young children, but they don't naturally write. Language is found in all societies, and while languages change, they don't get better. English today is not more complex than ancient languages. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create one. Writing, however, has been invented only a few times in history, in complex societies, and it developed slowly. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle. Children are naturally good at speaking, but writing is a skill that must be taught carefully. We need to understand how writing works and how children's minds work to teach them effectively."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started writing a novel with more uncertainty. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to name it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and it doesn't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader with an open ending. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between those times. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story more complete, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still alive, I've given them made-up names and taken care to ensure no one can recognize them. The man I'm writing about isn't famous. He might never be. When he dies, he might leave no more impact on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his chosen way of life and his unique character will influence others, and people might realize that he was a remarkable person. Then, it will be clear who I'm writing about, and those interested in his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source for his future biographers. I don't claim that the conversations I've included are exact quotes. I never took notes, but I have a good memory for things that matter to me. I've written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I haven't invented anything, but I've taken the same liberty as historians to create speeches for people in my story that I didn't hear myself. I've done this to make the scenes more lively and realistic. I want my book to be read, and I think it's fair to make it engaging. Intelligent readers will notice where I've used this technique and can choose to ignore it if they wish. Another reason I'm nervous about this book is that the people I'm writing about are from a different culture. It's hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really understand your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they played, and the poets they read. These things make them who they are, and you can't fully understand them unless you've lived them. You can only know them if you are them. Because you can't fully know people from another country just by observing them, it's hard to make them believable in a book. I've never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I've done so in short stories, it's because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader broad hints and let them imagine the rest. In this book, I don't claim that my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes, just like the main character."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the literary world often seems confusing to those experiencing it. It's only later that we can see clear patterns and recognize important figures. Today, poetry is especially complex with many different styles, debates, and ideas about the poet's role in society. Generally, there is a divide between 'literary' poets, who write for reading on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer performing their work to an audience. However, this division isn't strict.
Public poetry readings have become more common over the last twenty years. These events happen in various places, like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. The impact of these readings on poets is mixed. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live audiences, these performances are beneficial. Their work is often simple and easy to understand in one hearing, but may seem lacking when read on the page.
On the other hand, poets who focus on crafting their work with depth and complexity might not be fully appreciated in a live setting. They might feel pressured to choose their most accessible poems, which might not represent their best work. Listening to poetry readings is not a replacement for reading poetry, but it can be a helpful addition. Hearing poets read their work can show where to place emphasis, but it's best if the audience has the text or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to make poetry enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this method has challenges. It's a mistake to think that someone's spoken account is a perfect reflection of past events. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to cover. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status compared to the interviewee and how the historian has learned to interpret history, which might affect the interviewee's responses. Historians must acknowledge their role in shaping new evidence. However, challenges remain even after the interview. The interviewee's memories might be influenced by other sources, like the media, or altered by nostalgia or later life experiences. Emotions and attitudes can make the testimony seem convincing, but they might not accurately reflect the past.
**Animal Science**
Animal science can be studied in two main ways: focusing on physiology or on the whole animal. Physiologists study how the body functions, such as how nerves and muscles work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of the entire animal and what influences it. Within this approach, psychologists and ethologists are distinguished. Psychologists usually work in labs, studying how certain animals, like rats and pigeons, learn. Ethologists study natural, instinctive behaviors, often in wild settings. Although these fields are merging, physiologists often claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding nerve cell functions doesn't eliminate the need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure and must be studied at its own level. Describing a bird's nest-building by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
New social science students face the challenge of learning both the content and the methods of their subject. They need to understand the knowledge and research findings in textbooks and the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge. These two aspects are closely linked. Since we all experience social life daily, social sciences might seem like common sense. However, textbooks show that each social science goes beyond common sense. Each focuses on a specific part of social life, uses particular study methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the 'logical basis' of the subject, allowing social scientists to go beyond everyday understanding and distinguishing one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely from an earlier Greek source. Utility and function are not part of his definition, though he later discusses the best designs for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that didn't meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. These early structures, though basic, contributed essential elements to later sophisticated architectural designs. Despite their elaborate appearance, classical temples are essentially simple, single-roomed huts."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. Despite this, Chen found it amusing when he discovered what Lily had been doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange; Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, leaving early and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily practiced driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily, however, felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed or fined. This cautiousness might have reassured Mui. On the way, Lily noticed Mui's tense face in the mirror and thought it best not to add to her worries.
Lily locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked, ""no one will want that heap of tin."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing, feeling the warmth and responsiveness of his son. In that moment, Chen decided to raise Man Kee his way, ensuring he got a good education and eventually owned many restaurants.
The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw a ship on the horizon and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it clearly: a small, old tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It's a special ship for us. It may look small and old, but we know better. It will take us back home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was gone. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily with a view of seagulls following the ship's wake."
CPE_43,C2,"'THE WELL I had read somewhere that if you looked up from a deep hole, you could see the stars during the day. I convinced you to help me test this idea. You watched nervously as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't consider how much heavier the bucket would be with me in it, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle but then let go, and I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights, like the stars and planets you see in cartoons when a character gets hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to see if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding panicked, which stopped me. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I quickly climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows near the moat bridge. I could hear voices from the castle. Mother and Father came out with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Then I noticed the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I was hiding. I was scared someone would see them. Father was shining a flashlight into the well. I couldn't believe no one noticed the drops. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I realized my prank had gone too far and would lead to serious trouble. I regretted not thinking it through. I decided to act like I had just escaped. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and exhausted. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after I got out, hoping to stop them from checking. But Father didn't believe me. He looked at me with disappointment, and I realized he saw through my lie. Arthur also looked at me with pity, worried about my character. Their reactions made me feel ashamed and regretful.'"

Susan, now a widow, is leaving her family home as her children have grown up. The moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it, and indeed, everything unique about the house was being packed away. Fred, the removal man, with his large fingers, carefully handled the fragile items, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house overlooking a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered like dust in the air. 
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, then five, had asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?"" Now, Robert was there helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could handle the Steinway piano properly.
Fred, the removal man, noted that Susan didn't seem like she was going to cry. Susan asked if people often cried during moves, and Fred explained that they do, but they feel better once everything is at the new place. Susan could understand this feeling. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their job to notice any issues.
The piano was in the best room of the house and would be moved last. Sitting on the stairs, Susan remembered when they first moved in. The piano had been brought in first and got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for hours, and Francesca, then a child, cried that they couldn't live without a piano. Her husband Peter had solved the problem by hiring a builder to remove a window and using a crane to bring the piano in. It was an expensive process, and they couldn't afford to tune the piano for months. Peter had said, ""That's there forever,"" but forever is a long time.
Now, the children were busy, and Susan found it hard to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and the imperfect banister rails, feeling she should have warned the movers. But it was too late. Fred reassured her that only the piano was left to move. Susan felt emotional, realizing how moving things made them seem important. 
As the piano was carefully moved down the stairs and out the door, Susan, Robert, and Francesca laughed with relief. They walked down the path together for the last time, arm in arm, with tears of laughter in their eyes."
CPE_11,C2,"Title: Online Literary Criticism for Everyone
The idea of open access to the Internet was meant to allow anyone to publish or share content. In reality, some technical skills were needed, especially in the early days. However, one area that truly became accessible to everyone was literary criticism. With Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write book reviews. Amazon's approach allowed anyone to express their opinion on a book and rate it up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it provided free reviews for Amazon and gave potential buyers insights from other readers, not just publishers or professional critics. Other online bookstores offered similar features, but Amazon, being the largest, attracted the most reviews and also faced the most issues.
This open review system led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and it was impossible to check them all. Amazon had a team to ensure reviews followed guidelines, such as not allowing single-word reviews, personal attacks, or spoilers. However, reviewers were anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This allowed for some mischief, like authors writing fake positive reviews for their own books. For example, Lev Grossman wrote fake positive reviews for his book after receiving negative ones. His fake reviews were removed once he admitted to the deception.
Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon didn't verify if the comments were truly from the authors, except for well-known writers. For instance, a fake comment pretending to be from John Updike was removed. Most issues arose from reader reviews. When James McElroy's book ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, it received positive reviews from the press but negative ones from people mentioned in the book. These critical reviews disappeared after a few days.
Despite these challenges, Amazon saw the high number of reviews as beneficial for business. Reviews were meant to be a forum for discussing books, not a chat room, so Amazon closely monitored reviews of bestselling books. Silly reviews were more likely to be found on less popular books. For example, a humorous review of ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book, compared its plot to Internet architecture.
Overall, most reviews on Amazon were serious and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing feelings about them. This makes the democratization of book reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, we often talk as if every artist must rebel against the art of their time. We praise art for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We admire artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. But when it comes to contemporary art, we hesitate and say an artist has gone too far, questioning if it can still be called art. The media often voices these doubts for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to be puzzling and new. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and virtues present in today's art. We want artists to be different from the rest of us, with special talents and energy that break conventions. In the past, people commissioned art for specific purposes, making it part of everyday life. Today, we let artists work independently and get annoyed if they try to be more relatable.
**Picture This**
Let me describe a situation and ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book. The text questions the diversity of pictures, asking, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any flashy or charming style. The question is: Is the finished product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th, there is an unspoken rule in the art world that once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect consistency, and trying something new can disappoint the public. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the art-buying public often seeks comfort in continuity. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully break this mold. Eric Rimmington is another artist challenging expectations. His new show moves away from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington has always been fascinated by railways. His earlier drawings of Kings Cross Station led him to explore the underground world. These sketches inspired ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings capturing the unique charm of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, I am here to heal myself, if you want to put it that way. Apart from an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel suspended in memories. I spoke about the uselessness of art but didn't mention its comforts. The solace in my work as a painter or writer is that in silence, reality can be reimagined and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering hiding the true beauty beneath. For artists, art offers a joyful compromise with life's challenges, not to escape destiny like ordinary people, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"'Family Business'
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling about what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I was told you'll get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to act confident. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also hear,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you can talk well, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see in TV dramas.""
""Be that as it may,"" he said, pulling himself together, ""I feel your heart's never going to be in the family business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""
The problem was that, like many children in family trades, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw different career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a sort of consultant.""
My mother wasn't around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and because he was motherless, I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't a burden. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, fancy schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was full of interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and be a real help to me.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate decisions and especially the depression and sulks my father would fall into if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school, and then during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I stayed focused and used these last days wisely, he might be right. I felt confident and concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me for one last assignment, the most important business the family firm had ever attempted, and that it would be worth my while.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I've got my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could tell that such pressures were beyond my father's understanding (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would see a refusal as a betrayal in his time of need. That wasn't all. As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever his single-mindedness - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and self-control. In his way, he was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being extremely careful with money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good decision because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency with a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois was the one who pushed for the move, arguing that their flat wasn't suitable for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address wasn't suitable for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 
To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him resentful. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where his grandmother made sure his grandfather had peace after a long day in court. But times had changed. Lois made it clear before they married that her career was as important as his. Their lifestyle depended on both their salaries.
Now, their situation was threatened by Venetia, who was very upset when she confronted Simon. She accused him of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered feeling similar shame as a child facing punishment. He wished he had been prepared and could have said that Cartwright only mentioned the bribes after the trial and that he didn't believe him. But he lied directly, and Venetia knew it. Simon wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to ruin his career. He wasn't sure what she could do, but even a rumor could destroy him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops start to recognize you, even if you're not living your ""real life."" The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I'm watching the swifts fly between the trees and roofs. I've cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from cutting back rosemary and lemon balm. It's a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive.
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished manuscripts, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to be interested in them. I have her latest one now. ""How's the work going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""In no other job do you have to explain yourself a thousand times a day,"" she replies. Then she offers to bring something to drink from her fridge. I don't really want her in the garden, which now looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. ""You're on holiday now,"" she says, lounging in shorts and a vest on the chair. ""I should've gone into teaching. Writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can't, teach."" And some can't do either. ""So, what are your plans for the holidays?"" she asks.
I feel anxious about the school year ending. Empty days, hot pavements, and loneliness in the park. ""Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?"" I ask, my heart racing. ""Of course,"" Jaz says, knowing she will be around. ""Where will you stay? A fancy B&B?"" ""No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight."" It's not true, but I often deal with fiction. ""Going back to your roots. So, what do you think of my manuscript?"" Jaz asks about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I've only half-read. I like the title and tell her so. Red vans can seem cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and rejection letters to hers. I decide to be honest. ""Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good,"" I suggest. ""Teachers!"" Jaz responds like a rebellious student. ""I keep a journal,"" I say, ""where I write something good about each day."" My words sound old-fashioned. ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,"" Jaz says.
Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen reassures me. Then I suddenly remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, ""I've had my moments."" We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to the past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and their lives. Beyond personal stories, there is a need to learn about our broader past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel secure about the future by understanding the past. Just like inheriting genes, we inherit culture passed down through generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still part of us and provides a sense of belonging. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, we connected with the past through stories from our ancestors. However, Western industrial society disrupted communities, leading to the loss of many oral traditions. Now, places and buildings help us understand our past. It is crucial to preserve these links to honor our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose this setting. I picked the Fens because they seemed plain and empty, a perfect backdrop for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are neither flat nor empty. They are as English as any other part of England but also strangely unique. It's surprising that in the middle of England, the Fens feel foreign to many English people, even though other distinct areas have become part of the nation's cultural heritage. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, open yet mysterious. My research for the novel wasn't extensive; I haven't visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer imagining worlds rather than seeking documentary proof. Imagining the Fens has its logic because, as Edward Storey's book shows, the Fens are not just a landscape but a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections accessible. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more. Displays should be lively and interesting, using theatrical or architectural techniques to engage visitors and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers or use similar materials to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They offer encounters with authentic items that existed and had meaning in history. This is their strength, setting them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays, catalogues, and outreach programs will find that virtual history can actually support them by increasing interest in the real items they offer.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things isn't new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly now that everyone feels their impact. This can turn some people into strong preservationists and make others think more about the nature and future of towns. It's reasonable to say that people who have lived through events like world wars are more inclined to preserve things than those before them. Stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change isn't bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, like changes in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products related to intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday experiences. Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which marked the start of modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe in a new, more logical way by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be 'worthy', which to us meant 'boring'. Our mother didn't like our attitude and often criticized us, but our father would happily give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these 'improving' books. He would also sneak in some better-quality books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, marking them with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we ignored most of these books as 'boys' books', he did manage to introduce us to some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that 'the origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous'. This mysterious origin has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller suggested that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. ""Meuh"" sounds sad, and humans in dangerous lands full of scary animals might have made desperate noises. Some words in languages today might still echo these sounds, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of such odd theories, many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for eccentric people. However, recently, the origin and evolution of language have become important research areas. Language likely developed in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not its original purpose, despite philosopher John Locke's idea of language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode explores the art of writing reviews from a writer's perspective. Most reviews are created and shared under conditions that make them relevant for only a short time. There are deadlines and strict limits on their length. Once published, they last only as long as the newspaper or magazine they appear in—maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often defines their literary value. Many people, including the writers themselves, often think that reviewing is a job done out of necessity, like needing extra money, or because they can't spend all day working on a novel or a serious book. However, reviewing is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise and fair review in 600 to 800 words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed 6,000 to 8,000-word piece for an international journal. A 1,500-word article in a weekly magazine combines challenges of both short and long reviews. Length isn't the only factor. Reviewers must consider their audience, from casual weekend readers to those deeply interested in the subject. A reviewer needs to know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means reviewers often write other things besides reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who sees criticism as staying close to the shore, still enjoys writing reviews between his major novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. While some might think less famous writers should accept the temporary nature of their work, it's understandable if they want some recognition, especially if they believe their best writing is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been academic, and most of my serious books are academic, the kind professors are expected to write. In the English-speaking world, unlike some other cultures, there's no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it's common for the same people to do both. The days when academics criticized professors for writing reviews are mostly over, and complaints from non-professors about professors taking their opportunities are less common, partly because there's more reviewing work available now. I believe this is good for readers, who can trust that the reviewer knows what they're talking about, and for professors, as it helps keep them grounded. It also reminds them to communicate clearly with non-academics. While they might use complex language with each other, they need to be clear when addressing intelligent non-professors. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and entered the dark, still hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a brief unease about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home eagerly, wondering what the flat had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or plumbing issues, but the flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that it couldn't change. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or the answering machine would have messages, which he appreciated. He was glad the windows weren't broken and nothing was stolen, though he wondered what it would look like if it happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his evenings alone at home. Once he left the office and started his bus ride home, he felt more like himself and didn't need to be alone anymore, though he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time with his belongings, but once home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that his unsatisfying job had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but now questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction and purpose had faded; thoughts and feelings would come and go without finding a place. He remembered a time when he felt more in control and might have escaped his situation if he had realized his own value. After university, he tried to plan for a better future but found he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs his friends talked about, following their paths without imagining a job that would make him happy. He went to one interview and didn't think to evaluate the job, an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was just relieved to have a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he now faced daily. Neil offered him the job on the spot, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed through crowds, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music to get a good spot. The racecourse was a simple area marked off for the event. It wasn't like professional racecourses, but people stood on either side of the track to watch the goats race. Keeping the goats in order was a challenge since they are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I worried about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used a torch to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We replaced them, but the new ones didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we got hopeful. It was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.
**How to be Presentation Perfect - We Answer Your Questions**
I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? 
You're not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first convince yourself. Show your belief through passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to think of tough questions the audience might ask. Start by creating a positive atmosphere. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you're late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will tighten. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done quickly, while others take longer. We can get faster at solving puzzles or doing math in our heads, but some things can't be rushed. If we try, they might fail, like the mayonnaise, or get more complicated, like the fishing line. Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need the results"" is as silly as trying to sleep in half the time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds, suitable for different tasks. ""He who hesitates is lost,"" says one proverb. ""Look before you leap,"" says another. Both are true. The mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an instant reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my brain and body reacted immediately, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to think about their next move. This fast physical intelligence is like our ""wits."" Then there's thought itself, which involves figuring things out, weighing pros and cons, and solving problems. A mechanic fixing an engine, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this kind of intelligence, which we call ""intellect."" People good at this are called ""bright"" or ""clever."" Below this is a slower mental process, less clear and more playful or dreamy. In this mode, we are ruminating or meditating. Sitting by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or just before sleep, we are in a different mental state than when planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as intelligent as the faster ones. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury to cut back on when life gets busy. Slow thinking is essential. We need the slow mind as much as the fast one. Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries require a relaxed mental attitude. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is good for understanding complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is clear. When deciding where to go on holiday, the options might be obvious. But when we don't know what to consider or which questions to ask, or when the issue is too subtle for conscious thought, we need the slow mind. If the problem is managing a difficult team at work or deciding to change careers, it might be better to ponder than to search frantically for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long known the limits of conscious thinking and have embraced these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the parts of the mind beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists begun to study these slower ways of knowing. Cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can do many important tasks if given time. It can learn patterns too subtle for normal consciousness, understand complex situations, and solve difficult issues better than the conscious mind."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been warmly welcomed here. It's a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very remote area. At any time, there are about forty people - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - forming a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not for casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast. This isn't a practical problem for me, but at first, it affected my confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to choose, worried about the silence when I spoke, feeling anxious like I did in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness isn't about missing company or communication; it's because I've lost the social advantage my speaking skills usually give me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other, and he didn't pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face, and when we met again, he would shake hands with me politely but didn't try to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me out. After my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or the acting in his films. He focused on the photography, the soundtrack, and all the technical details. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or a great performance that moved the audience. He believed that people are affected by pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is designed well for emotional impact, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock's view of himself was always clear and logical. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience scream. He didn't deal with speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn't explore his screen characters deeply. He focused on film, pure film, and the precise, calculated beauty of what a strip of film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues, and telescopes were basic. There were also few books on how to do practical astronomy. Today, you can buy almost any telescope or equipment you need. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make almanacs and charts, and they help us analyze observations and publish results. This could be considered the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to find a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can last for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Society today has too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In the new economy, people always want the latest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, making it hard to keep up. This can make people feel tired and disconnected from life. More choices mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. Because of this, people are looking for 'simplexity'—simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interfere with this ritual. The guests at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned, maybe a bit odd, and some might say snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants today, which is seen as being equal. I also don't like overly friendly waiters who seem like they might slap you on the back. I know most of the other guests' names because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. Such respect for dignity and privacy is rare in commercial places these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct a harsh review I wrote when it first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the main role and unfairly judged his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. In fact, the entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include Cassio's competitive games with other young officers that become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I dare anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Don't miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the center of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the vast white plateau inside, life cannot survive. Except, that is, in a huge hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly beneath the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers worldwide have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that a group of scientists is getting very excited about what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the timeless quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all of this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I would have thought that the key issue here is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Our connection with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Often, we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complex dishes. But that's not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and a few herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with too much sugar and preservatives, you can make a delicious dessert in five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by bringing your own creation, no matter how simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning and meets our deep human needs, which is why all our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries, happen around tables. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And not many people would want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing them. Plus, there was extra paperwork from owning an apartment building. Books and journals were piled near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very precise about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think his office had been vandalized. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in behind her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, arrived while he was trying to clear some space on the carpet. He smiled at her hopefully as she unlocked his apartment door. Her look said she had no intention of cleaning his office. She believed he was from somewhere far away, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, which led her to create her own story of strength. In her personal story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she was blind, but the doctor assured her that the bone had protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches, which healed as a reminder of her past suffering. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a purpose.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking back to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It's thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care for her yearly throat infections, which were her only health issues. She valued how he always made time for his patients and truly wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always ready to give his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"Joanna's Lessons
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. Despite her hectic schedule, she has started writing books for young children learning the piano. Her performances are so captivating that even someone who is completely tone-deaf would be moved. Watching her play is like seeing a pianist push human limits. However, at a recent concert for children, one boy was not impressed until she played ""Match of the Day,"" a popular TV theme. For Joanna, this was amusing. She realized that in his eyes, she wasn't a real pianist until she played that tune. She easily played it and likely remembered the experience for future children's concerts.
Joanna is unique among top pianists because she is interested in how young children learn the piano. She has published her own beginner piano book for children called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even with her busy schedule. This summer, she is involved in many festivals and projects, including running her own recording label, Sound Circus. She often collaborates with other artists. So why take on writing a book? Joanna believes the first lessons are crucial. She thinks the music profession focuses too much on creating child prodigies, while most people have a more ordinary interest in music, which she finds more interesting.
Joanna's experience comes from teaching beginners between the ages of 18 and 25, before she became a concert pianist. Her childhood was filled with other children learning piano from her mother, which influenced her approach to music. She believes everyone should have the chance to learn piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French. Some children progress quickly, but she is more interested in those who take their time and enjoy it, even if they eventually stop. She worries that some parents push their children to achieve in music, rather than letting them enjoy it. Children often quit because they can't meet their parents' expectations.
Joanna's books are not the only ones designed to make learning piano fun, but she has a unique approach. She includes a storyline in her books and CDs to make learning interesting. From the first lesson, there are accompaniments in different styles for teachers or parents to play along with the child. If parents can't play, the CDs provide the music. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. She encourages improvisation and exploring the keyboard.
As children progress, they need to learn to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear as a child. However, she believes practice is the most important factor. She admits she didn't practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she had to practice to handle difficult contemporary pieces. Now, she enjoys practicing for eight hours a day, which she considers the core of her musical life, even more important than performing.
Joanna sympathizes with those who find practice difficult and believes it's not discussed enough. Her advice is to plan what you want to achieve before practicing, treat yourself by playing the whole piece even with mistakes, and mix hard pieces with easy ones."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen
Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is often not enjoyable to read. This suggests that good writing is challenging. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice there were few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard, which made me think more carefully. The slow process of writing by hand disciplined my mind. Since it was hard to change or erase, I wrote with care. On the other hand, using a computer can lead to carelessness. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is similar to the time spent writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can be emotionally heavy. Some say emails have brought back the art of love letters, with millions being sent instead of just casual talk. That's a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often don't realize the power of written words and may exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.
The CD
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's incredible they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi device. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the tray slid back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded at my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
Books versus Electronic Text
When comparing books and electronic text, author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches were invented after lighters, we'd be amazed by the improvement. Many people, excited by new technology, claim that electronic text is as revolutionary as the invention of printing and that this change is almost complete. They ignore that changes in how we think take generations. This kind of talk falls into the trap of thinking our generation is at the center of history. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that the 1980s would see books slowly disappear. So far, that prediction was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people don't do it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to read only parts of texts. Some technology enthusiasts argue that this leads to new forms of storytelling and creativity. But there's nothing new about ""non-linearity."" Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not read from start to finish. What's new is that computers don't encourage reading a whole text in one go.
The Office
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was free of the paper mess that had covered it since it was laid down, and the desk was dark wood, just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being placed in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You need to switch to computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing."" He admired the room and its antique furniture. He wasn't thinking about a computer or any other device, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had this conversation many times. She couldn't understand why he resisted technology when he was so skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related talents. She had inspired that paper. With a keyboard, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn't usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away would lead to chaos. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had made the mistake of commissioning books from. Ian was proof that people with unpredictable temperaments become even less reliable when working with friends. Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he had read many times, and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and set it aside. It was clear Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and felt like it had lost its conviction. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, with payments made chapter by chapter. But in that case, the payments were from a hypothetical advance that was never given. Ian's advance was huge, going against the business principle that authors should deliver a manuscript before being paid. Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was the most promising talent in a Cambridge full of promise. Ian's peers had taken over British theatre quickly, but Ian's energy seemed like laziness compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had overheard them. Yet, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While others succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit an arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many opportunities. The magazine used up its budget without publishing once. His contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his large salary, which increased to try to make him produce more, and then anything at all. At editorial meetings, Ian was witty but harsh, criticizing others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable even for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,C2,"'The breakfast change in England
Health experts agree that having a good breakfast is very important. However, historically, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are some references to travelers eating at dawn before long journeys and to sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most people, except for kings and nobles, did not eat breakfast. In the sixteenth century, breakfast slowly became common for everyone. Some believe this was because food became more available. However, they often overlook other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns might explain why breakfast became more important. People started working fixed hours, often very early in the morning. So, having breakfast became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to include based on their technical skills, artistic taste, personal opinions, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a newspaper reader might have an implicit understanding of the photos they see. However, instead of accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it truly shows the scene as it was. Or, does it reflect the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured important, or should the photo be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. You need to focus entirely if you want to succeed in sports. There's only one way to be the best, and you have to prioritize it above everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. It's a matter of survival. Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows and encourages individual excellence, yet it is a team game, and you must balance these two aspects. It's much like life—you can succeed individually, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot—not just money. It has opened doors for me and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things worldwide that others might not. But you also have to sacrifice a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences are so vivid that they become clear memories. For me, one such moment happened one night in California years ago. I lay awake, listening to the beautiful singing of a mockingbird hidden in one of the tall trees in the neighborhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic experience. To follow the bird's patterns, I had to use my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an incredible, spontaneous musical performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as each surprising musical variation came through the open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"Human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports. There's a bumping sound from the greenhouse as a small brown bird hits the glass. It's a wren, a bird often seen as a sign or omen. Is it trying to send a message from the edge of my imagination? Or is it just a bird trapped in a greenhouse? Both could be true, depending on your perspective. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens are still found in British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because folklore about birds is deeply rooted in our history, from a time when people relied on nature for survival. As cultures change, so do the meanings we attach to animals. For example, in the early 1500s, red kites were common in London and seen as helpful scavengers. But later, they were considered pests and nearly disappeared, except in Wales. Now, red kites are protected and have become symbols of conservation in Britain. Our connection to birds goes back to early human history. The first birdwatchers observed birds to detect predators, weather changes, and food sources, and also saw them as links to the spiritual world. When we ask why birds matter to us, we're also asking about our own identity. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and envy. Some might say these feelings are outdated, but like the appendix or wisdom teeth, they are still part of us. Birds have become indicators of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is not only a loss of unique birds but also a cultural loss. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize love and magic. Their decline is felt deeply by those familiar with literature and folklore. However, the loss of birds not featured in stories often goes unnoticed. Folklore is important because it connects us to birds in a way that scientific terms cannot. It evokes feelings and attitudes buried under modern life. Whether watching wildlife films or birds in our gardens, the excitement we feel is hard to explain scientifically. Birds engage us in ways we struggle to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding its song as it flies into the future, leaving us with a mystery to ponder."
CPE_28,C2,"Maps are used to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in terms of time, like ""a day's journey by river,"" which told more about how easy it was to travel through an area than the actual distance. Direction was less important for travelers who mainly wanted to know where to go and how far it was. Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, sometimes more so than maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway systems, might not show true directions accurately. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks, and these signs varied in size to show their importance. The style of these signs depended on the map's purpose and where it was made, so understanding early maps requires knowing the conventions used at the time.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and adding more details to maps. Cartography has used other sciences to help with this. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people used the magnetic compass, which allowed for more precise measurements. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it more accurately. Astronomers found out that the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to more precise mapping of large areas.
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for artillery, which required showing the land's surface features accurately. This led to the invention of contour lines. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had specific needs for maps. Today's cartographers have developed ways to map various distributions, like geological layers and land use. The recognition of maps' value in many sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography.
However, the development of cartography has not been a smooth, continuous process. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid development. Sometimes old ideas persisted alongside new ones. Cartographers often knew what needed to be done but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it was easier to copy old maps, and because of the investment in printing, map publishers were sometimes slow to adopt new ideas. Therefore, maps should not be taken as perfect evidence of the knowledge and techniques of their time. The many maps we have today are the result of much human effort and thought, making them valuable records for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"TIM RICE
I was invited into a young man's living room, which felt like a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms around it where his less ambitious family members spent their time. Moving from the kitchen to his living room felt like going from economy to business class on a flight. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and surprisingly, a teenager who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as wild; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams weren't a matter of life or death, though I can say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I was open to trying it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for instant praise for his music and a real, released seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier, which ended their failing career. We parted, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in the music charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I told myself I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to make a big impact on musical theatre, probably very soon. And even if we didn't succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, the certainty I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would, of course, keep looking at the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and would write a few more simple songs that wouldn't show the limitations of my voice, but it was still likely that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would surely have outgrown pop music, as my father confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists rather than pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn't really inspire me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the project was unoriginal in both concept and execution, borrowing too much from Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. On the other hand, Andrew's belief in the brilliance of his score was infectious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there's room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title as well, most of which had probably been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I skipped a day at the solicitor's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have an amazing ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy through language. Language is so essential to human life that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to speak naturally, much like how spiders know how to spin webs. Spiders didn't learn web-spinning from a genius spider or need special training; it's just something they do naturally.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, mainly created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can shape the look of landscapes. For example, warm and wet conditions all year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are rich in different species. On the other hand, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Daily weather patterns, which together form the climate, are caused by large air masses moving and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the air surrounds a spinning Earth, and since air is light, it doesn't move as fast as the Earth. However, the sun is a more important cause of air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and, more importantly, make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense coffee-making training, learning more than I ever wanted to about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key steps to making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might be demoted to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to get the hang of it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often fail to create good programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These art forms should be perfect for TV because cameras can show the whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a reliable critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I expected the series to focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of the industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who thought the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have found the opposite. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your accommodation doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis available. You can also rent a boat if you prefer to travel independently. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, naturally protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not just the sea that has treasures. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"'Build it yourself at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop
At the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, you can join a course to build your own custom bamboo bike frame. It's a fun weekend activity in Hackney Wick, east London. On a Saturday morning, the Bamboo Bike Club is buzzing with activity. Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction, with companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire leading the way. However, these bikes can be expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable. They spent years developing their idea in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They realized they didn't just want to sell frames; they wanted to share the experience of making something unique and sustainable. This led to the creation of the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more of a community project than a business. James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run monthly courses where participants can build their own bike frames.
The course teaches you how to select bamboo for strength and form strong joints. You start by assembling the front triangle of the bike with 40 mm diameter bamboo, then move on to the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. The process involves using jigs, power tools, and design blueprints, which can be challenging for those not used to DIY projects. However, James and Ian are there to help and ensure everything is done correctly.
Building the bike yourself is a big part of the appeal, and many participants are engineers. But even if you're not, Ian reassures that mistakes are okay and you can always try again. The bamboo is pre-checked for quality, and you can choose from different styles like plain, black, or mottled bamboo.
On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, or wraps, using hemp bindings and epoxy resin to create strong joints. A final polymer coating makes the bike waterproof. Once finished, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. These bikes are built to last and are as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested one off-road for three months without any issues.
Bamboo bikes may look a bit rough compared to professional frames, but they have a unique charm. They are ideal for a relaxed ride rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth, easy-going ride. The bikes are light and absorb vibrations well, making them comfortable to ride. James says the real joy comes when you take the bike on the road. The price for building your own bamboo bike is less than £500, making it an affordable and enjoyable project.'"
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was right. Dr. Gray, who is very understanding, is now a multimillionaire, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's small book on how to improve communication between men and women is a key part of the growing self-help industry. This industry claims to help Americans who want to improve their lives. It also benefits from these desires, creates many more, and supports the New York publishing world. Britain is learning that this genre can fill shelves with books that are as exaggerated as their covers. However, many self-help books are rejected for being too similar to others or too specialized, which is a relief. Editors are looking for the next big hit, and the writing style is not their main concern. What matters is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the key questions and admits, ""If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""
**Autobiographies**
There needs to be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. This agreement is rarely fully kept. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They might feel too ashamed to share certain actions or thoughts. They might leave out things they think are not important. There are also more complex reasons for not sticking to the truth. The writer might believe that inventing stories can better capture the truth about themselves than sticking strictly to the facts. Or they might decide from the start not to follow the truth at all. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, which helps them tell their story. Some readers might still believe it is true even after finishing the book, thinking they have read a true story when it is actually fiction. This can be done without any intention to deceive.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Experts on detective stories say this genre became popular because it reflects the conflicts of late 19th and early 20th-century society. A detective story is like a symbolic story. The crime represents human desires like lust or greed, and solving it, at least in traditional stories, shows how a person can fit back into society, calming their lawless desires so society can work smoothly again. In Hammett's unique version, society returns to its previous state, but it is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal in Hammett's stories are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and are, in a strange way, comfortable with each other. The private detective is part of both the criminal world and the law. To criminals, he seems too honest, and to the law, he seems too shady. He is both a criminal and a competitor. The private detective's mission is sometimes affected by his feeling of being part of both worlds, and sometimes his desire to punish is stronger because he is worried about this ambiguity.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is considered today's greatest scientific essayist. To talk about his writing and get his advice, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt very comfortable there. Gould said, ""I couldn't write about a place like this: Trollope might, but he knew the culture. Understanding the culture is key to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is its own civilization. Only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't live in the community and don't understand its rules, you are at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's principles is to never underestimate the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but must never dilute it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers feel they are being talked down to, your piece is finished."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quieter times, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This is an example of how air-conditioning is often overused in modern life. It has become a key part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control or change the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and release it at night. These simple measures can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It's not a coincidence that the start of a new millennium has brought renewed interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became garden decorations—romantic but outdated in a modern technological age. Now, interest in them is growing again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there's a magical moment when a sundial starts working. They are calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with precise brushstrokes. It was fascinating because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, suggesting they had either practiced for years or had a natural talent for precision. Remembering this, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting course. Would beginners show natural artistic skill? In reality, the atmosphere was not intimidating. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher didn't want to paint petals on teacups as quickly and precisely as I remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent mentioned that the other people in their package were a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland instead of Venice.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they were surprised to hear people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe there was a cancellation or the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
When they landed, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. There was no mention of an overnight stop in their brochure, but Keith thought it was just a stopover. It was almost midnight when they arrived at the hotel, and they were too tired to question it. The next morning, they realized they were supposed to stay there for the whole holiday, and they became worried.
The receptionist told them about the lake and the steamer to Interlaken. Keith calmly explained there was a mistake; they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip, hoping it would help.
A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, approached them. Dawne asked if she was in charge because they were in the wrong hotel. Keith explained they must have joined the wrong group. Mrs. Franks explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, and it was easy to follow the wrong group.
Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks said she would check and left them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they heard typing. Dawne thought Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that happened.
An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, interrupted Keith's thoughts, saying they had a great night's sleep. Keith and Dawne left the reception area. They didn't mention the irony of ending up on a holiday with elderly people when they wanted to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had insisted on this trip, even though they tried to convince him to come with them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON American executives are now looking up to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. In Britain, most people know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as 'an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,' which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are showing great enthusiasm for him. Biographies and accounts of the Endurance voyage are being produced and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life. Some American managers have also started to see Shackleton as a role model. His admirers share stories of his achievements with admiration and draw lessons in leadership and communication from them. They even refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton.' The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber-stove, has become a model for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm specializes in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises.' For example, dealing with situations like 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go.' While Shackleton once worked in public relations for a Glasgow steelworks, it might be hard to see the connection between surviving on albatross in freezing temperatures and handling a financial crisis. 'Even if a company manages its crises well, it can still cause harm by communicating poorly,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. He had his values in order and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most fascinating decisions was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That decision showed his credibility for future expeditions: the lives of his men were most important.' This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to the South Pole when, 97 miles short of their goal, with supplies running low and limited time to return to their ship, Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. While managers today often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take it on. His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually crushed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety if you continue to do your best and trust me.' From the accounts and diaries kept by his men, it's clear that Shackleton was always in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every possibility, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go of losses and start anew. We've developed effective principles here that Shackleton exemplifies. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.' Shackleton believed an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance, and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate situations is to do nothing, especially in America, where the culture is against letting time solve problems,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on interest rates, you hold on, and eventually, you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell would mean a big loss. Similarly, don't be afraid to change plans if they're not working. If a new product fails, don't keep selling it.' Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He forced his own gloves on Hurley, saying if he didn't wear them, he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were starving on the 1905 expedition: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism today. Everything else fades away, and he stands as the true embodiment of the ideals we long for now.'"
