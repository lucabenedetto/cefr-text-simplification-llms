CPE_15,C2,"'Paying for Trash Some places want families to pay for each bag of trash they make. This sounds good for the environment and money, but it might not work well. In many countries, trash is picked up for free. Families pay for this with local taxes. A family with a lot of trash pays the same as a family with little trash. But more trash means more trucks and workers are needed, which costs more money. If trash pickup is free, people might make too much trash. One idea is to make families pay for each bag of trash. This might make them throw away less and recycle more. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea can have problems. They looked at some American towns that started charging for trash. People had to buy stickers for their trash bags. Only bags with stickers were picked up. In Charlottesville, Virginia, people paid 80 cents for each bag. The number of bags went down by 37%, but people just put more trash in each bag. The weight of trash went down by only 14%. In other towns without this system, trash went down by 3.5% anyway. Some people also dumped trash illegally to avoid paying. Recycling went up by 15%, but many people were already recycling. Fullerton and Kinnaman found that charging for trash does not reduce it by much. A 10% increase in sticker price only cuts trash by 0.3%. People would need to buy less of everything to make a big change. Other things like income and education might also affect how much trash people make. Richer towns throw away more trash and have less time to recycle. Charging for trash is not a bad idea, but it is complicated. Simple ideas can have complex results.'"
CPE_19,C2,"'Work Theodore Zeldin talks about how our jobs might change. Do people respect and appreciate you at work? Just having a good job is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Before, loving your job was special. Now, you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. Does it make you happy? Does it help you grow? If your job makes you boring or too busy, no money or status can make you feel good. I want to find out how work can make people happy and help them grow. Work should not just be about making money. It should help us live better lives and meet new people. But this does not mean everyone will have a job. People want jobs that make them happy and are interesting. Work should be like art, with happy people at the center. Many jobs are not as good as they used to be. Doctors are stressed, accountants worry about their work, and architects cannot be creative. Managers are not happy with their jobs. Companies are getting smaller. New ideas like making decisions together and rewarding good work are not working well. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company's values. I am looking at different jobs to see how they affect people. I study what people can do and how they can be brave. I look at happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am looking for better ways to work. Many experts help companies make more money, but we also need to think about what makes us happy. How many people feel alive at work? How many feel like they are stuck in their jobs? For example, hotel workers often have low pay and long hours. Hotels have not changed much since the past. They could be places where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. Hotel workers could do more than just simple tasks. If hotels cared about their workers' dreams, they could offer more services. But accountants say hotels should focus on making money. We need to think about work from a human side, not just a money side. Work is about relationships. People want to be independent and choose their jobs and coworkers. They need to talk to people from different jobs. Communication is important, but real conversation is more. It helps people understand each other and feel equal. Every good conversation can change the world a little bit.'"
CPE_24,C2,"Broadcasting means sending out information to many people. A long time ago, broadcasting meant planting seeds by hand. Now, it means sending words and pictures to people, like on TV. 
TV started as a way to send information from one place to many homes. This was because of how society and business worked. People tried other ways, like two-way TV, but they did not last. In the 1930s, people watched TV in public places, not just at home. 
Big companies wanted to sell TVs for homes, so they made rules for TV equipment. As more people could buy TVs, watching at home became normal. This was part of modern life, where people moved around more and lived in smaller groups. 
Broadcasting helped governments share important news with everyone. It also helped people feel connected to their country. Broadcasting was important for democracy, letting people join in political and cultural life. 
Today, TV and broadcasting are changing. The way we use these technologies might be different in the future."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like having many things does not make you feel safe. It is normal to want a home that is nice and meets your needs. But sometimes, wanting more things can become too much. Advertisements try to make us feel like we need more things. They say, ""If you don't have this, you are not good enough."" Next time you walk down the street, try not to look at any ads. Ads are everywhereâ€”on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, shirts, and the internet. They all tell us to buy more things.
**Caves**  
People all over the world study caves. They want to know where caves come from, how water moves in them, and what lives in them. Caves are interesting and make us curious. Many people study caves because they are a part of nature. Some people study caves for fun, and some do it for science. You need to be fit to visit many caves, so not just professors study them. Both professionals and people who love caves for fun learn about them.
**Weather Watch**  
A long time ago, people watched the weather with just their eyes. This helped start the study of weather, called meteorology. Today, we use satellites and computers to learn about the weather. Computers do math very fast to help us understand the weather. But human experience is still important. People can see things that computers cannot. This helps make better weather forecasts."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
I used to think opera was mostly theatre. But now I know music is more important in opera. I come from theatre, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, the audience and actors usually speak the same language. 
In music, like in a concert or opera, many people do not know much about music. They might feel shy about this. But they admire the musicians' skills. Musicians work very hard for many years. Watching them is like watching athletes. We know they do something similar to us, but much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They do not always understand how hard acting is. They are not always impressed by long speeches. But they often ask actors, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" 
Theatre and music audiences can be the same people. But in theatre, the audience and actors are more equal. Music can learn from theatre about this relationship. Music is full of feelings and can be like theatre. But music often feels formal, with dress codes and respect for conductors and soloists. 
Sometimes, music audiences clap at the wrong time. This can interrupt the performance. But many people are working to make music more welcoming. I remember a special event with music in a cathedral and town. It was amazing and changed many people's lives. 
I want music to take more risks, like theatre. Sometimes, using new places for music can surprise everyone. It might be uncomfortable, but it can be exciting. I love both theatre and music. I want more people to enjoy them like I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
I do not like sand very much. Sand can become glass and concrete, which is useful. But on the beach, sand is not nice. It gets in your face and in your food. It hides things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove. But when you step on a towel or get in a car, sand falls off. You find sand in your shoes and socks for days. Sand stays with you for a long time. I do not want sand.
**Lock and Key**  
People want their homes to be safe. Long ago, people used a beam to lock doors. Now, we use electronic locks with cards. But people like using a key. At work, electronic locks are okay. At home, people like to use a key. One company made a new lock with a key and electronic system.
**Modern Art**  
I was worried about going to the new Tate Modern gallery. I do not understand modern art. I like some art, like furry things and big photos. I do not know much about art. Art should talk to you, but it does not work for me. The new gallery helps people understand art. There are labels that explain the art. The labels help me understand the pictures."
CPE_46,C2,"**Making Movies from Books**
When we make a movie from a book, we often have to cut out parts. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help us see what is important. When I worked on a movie script, I saw that I could remove some words and still tell the same story. This does not mean the book had too many words. Books and movies tell stories in different ways. In books, we often repeat things to help the reader understand. In movies, we show things with pictures.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch a movie, we feel like we are in a different world. We forget about real life for a while. But when the movie ends, we come back to the real world. Some people think movies are just for fun and not art. They like movies but do not think they are important.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around. There were three main doors, but only one took you where you wanted to go. It was confusing for new people, but the workers knew their way. The workers made movies that people loved to watch.
**Making Movies**
Many people want to make movies. There are books and classes to help them learn. Some people make movies with little money, like Robert Rodriguez. He made a movie for $7,000 and became famous. In the past, people took a long time to learn how to make movies. They worked on small projects first. Now, people often start making movies on their own."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, many houses were on the west side of the city. They were small and not very nice. In summer, a factory nearby made the air smell bad. In the morning, a paperboy would hold his nose because of the smell.
I don't remember much from when I was young. But I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses. I also remember my mother. She was small and often angry. I didn't know why she was angry, so I couldn't make her happy. She liked to be alone, even with many people around. She wanted everything to be very clean and proper. She told me to ""behave proper,"" but I didn't understand what she meant.
My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who liked the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn't talk much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They talked about things like the weather and their children. I felt like I was one of the children they talked about.
Growing up in West Earlham was the same for everyone. Before you were five, you stayed at home. I remember playing on a rug while my mother sat in a chair. After you turned five, you went to school. Some kids had a mother with a bike to take them. My mother let other kids take me to school.
I remember the summer holidays. Sometimes, I saw things outside West Earlham. There was an old man who told stories about the sea. Once, I went to a charity event where a nice woman gave lemonade. She wanted me to join a group, but my mother said no because she thought they just wanted money.
My mother didn't like politicians. She thought they took money from people. But she cared about my education. Sometimes, we went to the Norwich Castle Museum. We looked at paintings. My mother even made a joke once about a painting of a Roman soldier. She said, ""I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"""
CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue. It was getting dark, and the air was wet. I knew this street well. My neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, lived here. There was also Han Kieffer's grocery store. My friends lived in the houses on this street. When I was a child, I played here. The street goes downhill, and the houses change. Some houses became stores, and some stores became houses again.
Bachelor Fads
Rick Gilbert lives in a big, open apartment. It used to be a curtain warehouse. The apartment has big doors and brick walls. Rick did not want one big open space. He used a big plastic wall to make different rooms. The kitchen is in the middle. Rick likes to cook for friends and make coffee for work. He has modern chairs and old furniture from his parents.
Bruce Chatwin
Bruce Chatwin was a writer. He liked to travel and write about his trips. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" was very good. He mixed real stories with made-up ones. He wanted to show that travel can teach us about history and exciting stories.
Swimming
One summer, it rained a lot. I went swimming in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles in the water. I thought about swimming a long way across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea. Swimming is a way to see the world differently. It helps us find places that are still wild and mysterious."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children bond. Many people think children cry because they feel helpless. But why do adults cry? It is not easy to explain. The sound of crying is less important than seeing someone cry. Crying might have helped early humans trust each other and feel connected. We can cry for other reasons too. We might cry when we feel sorry for someone. We might cry when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry when watching a sad movie, especially with other people. Crying seems to have a social purpose, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
Global warming means the Earth is getting warmer. We are not sure how much warmer it will get or how it will change our lives. A warmer Earth can change the weather everywhere. This can affect plants, animals, water, and soil. We use these things to grow food and build cities. Changes to these are important.
In the last 100 years, people have put more gases in the air. These gases make the Earth warmer. Scientists think this is because of pollution. They use computers to study the weather and make guesses about the future. These guesses are not perfect, but they help us understand what might happen.
By the year 2100, the Earth might be 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer. The sea level might rise by 15 to 95 cm. There might be more heatwaves, floods, and droughts. These changes can affect where plants and animals live and how we get food and water.
Some changes might be good. For example, in Australia, warmer weather has helped grow more wheat. But many changes might be bad. Less water might be available in dry places. Ice might melt, changing the land and sea. The Arctic ice might disappear, making it easier to travel by sea but also more dangerous.
The sea level rising is a big problem. Many people live near the coast. If the sea rises, places like London, New York, and Tokyo could have big problems. People might lose their homes and need to move. Small islands might disappear completely. This would be very hard for the people living there."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong and healthy. This is the plan of Dennis Tito, a rich man, to send a spaceship on 5 January 2018. The spaceship will go 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel. This is important because the next chance to go to Mars is in 2031. New technology is needed for this trip. If everything is ready in time, the spaceship might go. Even if it does not go, the work will help future space trips.'"
CPE_44,C2,"Title: Art and Everyday Life
Art is something we see in buildings, books, paintings, and statues. People often think art is just these objects. But art is more than that. It is about what these objects make us feel and think.
Sometimes, we forget this because some art is very famous and old. We admire it without thinking about why it was made or how it makes us feel today. This makes it hard to understand art.
Art should not be separate from our daily lives. It is like a mountain that is part of the earth. To understand art, we need to look at our everyday experiences. We should see art in things like movies, music, and comics. These are things people enjoy every day.
To understand art, we need to look at the simple things around us. We should enjoy the colors, sounds, and feelings they give us. Art is not just in museums. It is in our daily lives, in the things we see and hear every day."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Lions are big cats. People think lions hunt together like a team. They hide and then catch their food. Lions live in groups. They work together to find food and take care of baby lions. But, sometimes, lions do not always work well together. We started watching lions in 1978. We wanted to know why they help each other. Lions can live for many years. We are still learning about them.
**Pop Music Review**
Bedrock is a music band. They made a new album called ""New Life."" This album changed rock music. The music is fun and has different sounds. The songs talk about life and feelings. The album has 16 songs, and all are very good.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I liked stories about wise women called ""The Sibyl."" My mother told me a story about an old woman and a king. The woman had nine books. She sold three books to the king for a lot of money. I learned a lesson from this story. I was sometimes lonely. My mother said to do fun things so other kids would want to play with me. It worked. I like to write about places. I like to think about old things and history.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you write a book, you send it to a publisher. The book waits in a pile. A young person or an older person reads it first. If they like it, they show it to a boss. The boss decides if the book is good. They think about how many people will buy it. They also want to know if the writer can help sell the book. Sometimes, they meet the writer before saying yes."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising Challenges in the 1990s**
In the early 1990s, people working in advertising had a hard time. The economy was bad, and many people lost their jobs. In Britain, in 1991, the economy went down, interest rates were high, and people spent less money. Many homes were taken back by banks, and businesses like car and building companies lost a lot of money.
Advertising workers felt a lot of pressure. They had to do more work with less money. Companies wanted to make sure they sold things people wanted, not just what was easy to make. This made marketing more important, but also harder.
In the 1980s, advertising was very successful. But in the 1990s, it was difficult. Companies started to look closely at how much money they spent on advertising. They wanted to know if it was worth it. Many companies were not sure if advertising was helping them.
Companies wanted better advertising. They wanted good ideas and good places to show their ads. They wanted the best people to work hard for them. Advertising people had to find ways to do more with less money.
There were other problems too. The economy was bad, and there were new rules about advertising. People wanted different things, and companies had to think about advertising in other countries.
Advertising people had to make sure more of their ads worked well. But it was hard to find help or advice. Companies that did well kept their secrets. Books and talks about advertising did not always help.
In the end, advertising people had to work very hard to make good ads with less money."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Kitchen Dream**
When I was at university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not common. Most people did not want to cook. Being a chef is hard. The work is long and not paid well. But I still wanted to do it. I was not happy at university. The work was hard, and I did not like the social life. Cooking seemed better. It felt real and honest. I first wanted to cook after eating at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I wanted to know how to make food like that. I started reading cookbooks and cooking a lot. My history degree was not important to me anymore.
**Learning to Dive**
The swimming teacher was a small, strong man with tattoos. I asked him to teach me to dive. He told me to sit at the pool's edge, put my hands up, and roll forward. I practiced this a lot. Next time, I stood up and dived from the edge. The teacher was strict. He said, ""Don't look down, look up!"" and ""Keep your legs straight."" The next week, I went to the high board. It was very high. I was scared but jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. I did not dive well, but I was happy. I felt free like a bird.
**The Traveller**
Some people like a comfortable bed and running water. But some people like adventure. They climb high mountains and sail alone in the sea. They eat strange food if they have to. They live with danger and the unknown. These people are different. They are not like most of us. We like our safe world with microwaves and phones. We do not understand why they take risks.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who is afraid of the sea. But he spends a lot of time sailing. He is not the best sailor, but he is good. He sails because he likes to write about it. His boat has a device that tells him where he is. He likes this device. But he thinks the compass changed how people sail. Before the compass, sailors watched the sea and waves. Now, they just look at the compass. The sea is now just a space to cross. Raban has time to look at the waves because his boat can steer itself."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer is a time for two happy things: going on holiday and reading books. These two things go well together. Books help us feel good in the world. We can see our own lives in the stories of books. Books show us our thoughts and feelings. They say things we feel but cannot say. This is special, especially if the book is from a far place or a long time ago. We thank these writers for helping us know ourselves. 
When we travel and read, we see new things. Our eyes are open in a new place, just like when we read a good book. We notice things we did not see before. We see the sky, people's faces, and our feelings. 
**Author's Note**
These travel stories were in a newspaper called the Observer. I made some small changes, but not many. Sometimes I fixed mistakes. In one story about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it did not. I did not change the story because it was true at that time. 
Travel is about seeing the world, even if we do not know everything. We learn as we go. 
**Ecotourism**
Ecotourism is a word used a lot. It started in the 1980s. People wanted to travel without hurting the environment. Now, many trips are called ecotourism. It can mean living with tribes or a short boat trip. The idea was good, but now it is used for many things. 
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notes from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found them again by luck. They helped me remember my trip. In Transylvania, I stayed in nice houses for a long time. I did not write much then because I thought there was nothing to say. Later, I wrote my book and let the story tell itself."

CPE_31,C2,"**Music and the Future**
Technology is changing how we live and enjoy music. In the past, people listened to music on the radio, TV, and CDs. Now, there are many new ways to listen to music. Because of this, there are fewer live music shows and jobs for musicians.
Music is important for everyone. It is part of big events and personal activities. In the future, music will still be important, but it might change. People might still want to learn to play instruments. Playing music can help people learn other skills, like being on time and working well with others.
In the future, people might listen to many different kinds of music. Technology will help people make music, even if they do not know how to play an instrument. More people might want to make music in their communities.
To prepare for the future, music teachers need to change how they teach. They should help more people learn to play instruments. Music teachers will need to be good at working with many people and teaching different skills.
Music is important in our lives, and we should not forget that. People who work in music need to show how important music is."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes people make fun of actors. This happens when actors talk too much about their work in interviews. They should be like the dancer Pavlova. When someone asked her what her dance meant, she said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Actors often use big words or talk about gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, said that acting is only interesting when you do it, not when you talk about it. Every play is new for an actor, and they learn each time. When a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next one.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet. He is between being a boy and a man. His acting is simple and strong. He is very good with the words and his body. He is smart and confident. Lester plays a young man who is a bit angry but also funny. He is both strong and nice. His acting is very good. When you watch him, you see how he moves and acts. It makes you think about what acting is and what real behavior is.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director has a special way to practice plays. The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors sit and listen. When it's their turn, they read the words, think about them, and then speak. They imagine a scene, like waiting in the rain. They find a reason to say the words. The director says to keep an open mind and trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
A perfect theatre makes you feel important. Going to a play is special. The staff should make you feel welcome. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well. The theatre should fit the human voice and body. Old theatres often have a good design. They feel like they have history. Plays should surprise you. You want to see something new and exciting."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll music was very popular with young people. It was important because it changed how many people, including older ones, thought about music. This music helped new rock stars to become famous. Paul Simon, a young boy in the US, loved this new music. He listened to it on the radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party by Alan Freed. Many young people listened to this show. Paul Simon, like John Lennon in England, was excited by the music. He wanted to make his own music.
**Snow Adventure**
I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I walked on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole. The hole was about four feet deep. The snow had covered a space between two rocks. I climbed out, feeling scared. I sat by a pine tree to think. I had walked half a mile in one hour. I knew I had to stop my plan.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books about qualitative research. These books talk a lot about collecting data but not much about how to look at the data. Many people do not know how researchers study their data. We asked some social scientists to talk about how they do it. We wanted to understand the process better, not just make a guidebook. This is not easy, so we let them share their work in different ways, like telling personal stories or using formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was using his teeth and trying to look like a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was copying a TV show. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs. He didn't know much. Many people like learning on the internet and computers, but is it good? One dad tried a computer program with his son. The dad read the words, but the son played with the pictures. The dad said, ""If he read a book for ten minutes, he might learn something."" TV shows, like my son's, give ideas but not much learning. Learning is better with teachers or parents talking. New technology is good, but schools are still important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most movies were made in Hollywood. People in Los Angeles didn't like it at first. But they liked success. Success means making money from movies. Hollywood knows a good movie when it makes a lot of money. In less than 100 years, Hollywood became famous like New York, Rome, or Paris. It changed a lot. A long time ago, there were orange trees. Now, it is a busy place. People in Hollywood talk about movies, who is dating, and who is working on new projects. Successful people sometimes leave, but many people in show-business come to Hollywood.
**Photography**
Photography was made by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to keep pictures of what they saw. They used light, lenses, and chemicals to make pictures. These pictures were better than paintings. Some artists didn't like this new way. They said photography was not art. But photographers knew it was a new art. They used cameras like artists use brushes. They showed the world and people in it.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, all children's books had pictures. Even books for older kids had pictures. Many children's books were made, but not all were good. Some were great. The old black-and-white pictures are like a mix of junk and treasure. Some pictures will be shown again in new books or exhibitions. People are starting to like these old pictures again. Maybe a publisher will make new books with these classic pictures."
CPE_68,C2,"'Blogging: Sharing with the World Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of telling everyone where you are online. It said that when you say, 'Hey, I'm here,' you are also telling everyone, even people you don't know. This shows that sharing too much online can be bad. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. We think we might get rich or famous, so we share our stories and photos online. But sometimes, we share too much and it can be dangerous. This can be sad, but don't worry. Some people have already learned about these problems. A long time ago, some people started sharing their lives online. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and became famous before social media was popular. These people were the first bloggers. They learned lessons that can help us today. In 1994, a student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. He wrote about everything and shared photos. Many people read his blog. But one day, he had to stop because it caused problems in his life. He learned that sharing too much can make people not trust you. In 2002, Heather Armstrong wrote a blog about her job. Someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But Heather's story ended well. She got married, started her blog again, and now writes about her family. She learned to share carefully online. We should remember that we can say anything online, but it doesn't mean we should.'"
CPE_23,C2,"'Do You Get Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired. In busy countries, people often do not sleep well. In the USA, 40 million people have sleep problems. Some books in Britain talk about people who cannot sleep. People are interested in sleep. They want to know how much sleep they need. One sleep expert says, 'People need more sleep. They wake up early to go to work.' A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep before. In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, noise affects sleep, and driving when tired. They ask students to help with their research. Students get paid and change their sleep for the study. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put things on their heads to study sleep. But they only look at physical things. In a dark room, there is a car simulator. People come at 2 pm after little or no sleep. They drive and answer questions. The road looks long, and the sun is bright. The air is warm. People say they will not sleep, but they do. Dr. Reyner has a video of someone trying not to sleep. At first, he is awake, but then he blinks and nods off. Coffee can help. Two cups can make you a safe driver for 30 minutes. Dr. Reyner suggests coffee, energy drinks, and gum for alertness. Shift workers can use them. We know people sleep in cycles like other animals. There are four stages of sleep. Dreams happen in light sleep. The brain stops the body from moving to prevent injury. Scientists know women sleep 30 minutes more than men, and older people need less sleep. In the past, people had different sleep patterns. Between 1500 and 1850, people in Britain slept in two parts. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was quiet and good for thinking. Poor people liked this time because they were free from work. In the 17th century, with more light, rich people started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer, so they slept less. In some places outside Europe and America, people still sleep in parts. They sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noise and danger make it hard to sleep all night. People everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"'I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wanted to look like a cowboy, but I was not a cowboy. I came from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy from the sky. But at the airport, a real cowboy saw my new boots and just walked away. I used to be a racing driver. I loved driving fast cars. But now I don't drive anymore. I tried to find new things to do, like talking about races on TV or selling old cars, but they didn't work out. Being an 'ex' racing driver is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost won. I miss driving fast cars and being famous. Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked at the sky and saw birds. I realized I have a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
Many people from different countries live in Vancouver, Canada. In the evening, people like to walk in the city. You can hear many languages when you walk. People like Vancouver because it has nice weather, is between the ocean and mountains, is clean and safe, and has good schools and jobs. Many new buildings are in the city now. Vancouver is a busy place where people start their journeys to other places.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists, like me, do not write many letters. Some say it is because we do not get paid for letters, but I think it is because we try too hard to make our writing perfect. Real artists write with feeling. Shakespeare, a famous writer, wrote beautiful lines without thinking too much about it.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, when a new supermarket opened in Britain, a famous person would cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open often, and anyone can open them. Last week, people waited for a new Superbuy store to open. The first five men got a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women got flowers. People at the front of the line were happy, and people at the back were not."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
Citizen Kane is a famous movie. It came out in 1941. At first, not many people watched it. But later, TV made it popular. Many people who make movies today love Citizen Kane. It was the first movie by Orson Welles. He did not know the rules, so he made the movie his way. He had a great team. Gregg Toland was the cameraman. Herman J. Mankiewicz wrote the story. Linwood Dunn did special effects. The movie is about a newspaper boss. Some people think it is about William Randolph Hearst. Orson Welles was the director and actor in the movie.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting strange. He told her he might be late and go to the golf club. He needed to talk to someone there. Carmel just nodded and smiled. Dermot asked what she would do that day. Carmel said she would walk around town and look at shops. She thought it was nice to relax. Dermot said she should enjoy herself. He also said if he was late, he would not need dinner. Carmel said that was fine.
**Job Titles**
A study showed that job titles can make people unhappy at work. Many workers want better job titles more than a pay raise. People do not like being called ""subordinate."" They want titles that show their skills, like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator."" But these titles are often just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"I was in Vienna to take pictures. Taking pictures was my job and my passion. I loved how light looked on things and how one picture could show a special moment or place. I always hoped to take the perfect picture. I had a camera with film, ready to take more pictures. 
Once, I took a picture of smoke from a burning oil well. It was very popular and appeared in newspapers and magazines. After that, I worked for myself. But things did not go as well as I hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was happy to take pictures and get paid.
I got the job in Vienna by chance. I took pictures in London for a book about four cities: London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the job in Vienna, so they asked me to do it. I was free, and they liked my work. Things at home were not good, so I was happy to go to Vienna.
They gave me a place to stay in the city center. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was busy and hot. This time, it was cold and snowy. I knew I would enjoy it and take great pictures.
On the first day, I rode trams around the city to see everything. I wanted to make Vienna my own. I waited for the right moment to take pictures. The next morning, I went out early. The snow made the city look beautiful. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one shot. Still, I knew it could be magical.
Photography is special. You can watch a picture appear on paper, and it feels like magic. That morning in Vienna, something special happened, and it did not surprise me."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**
A new art show in London is about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. The show is at the Hayward Gallery. It is a special show because it does not have many words to explain the art. People can look and think about the art by themselves. The show has paintings, drawings, and films. Guy Brett, who knows a lot about kinetic art, made this show.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is an artist. Many people like his art. His art is easy to understand. Some people like his art because it shows fun things. Others like him because he is funny and nice. Some critics say he is not a great artist. But Hockney knows he is not the best. He thinks only time will tell if he is a great artist.
**Window-shopping Art Show**
A curator made a show called ""Window-shopping."" It was in an empty warehouse. The show had art that was very different. One artist made cats that moved on a toy train. Another artist used a video camera in a strange way. The art did not have a common theme. The curator wanted to show that art can be different and still be good.
**Art History**
Some people like to look at paintings but do not want to study them. They think studying art can ruin the fun. But knowing more about art can make it more interesting. Art is not just about what we like. It is also about what society likes. Understanding art can help us enjoy it more."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
A long time ago, people wanted to look nice. They found shiny yellow stones in rivers. These stones were gold. Gold is soft and easy to shape. People liked it a lot. They also found copper. Copper is good for making tools. People learned how to get copper from rocks. This was important for them.
**St Ives**  
We walked with our bags down a small street. It was very windy and cold. The sea waves were big and hit the road. No one was outside. The houses were closed tight. We came to St Ives on a small train. The sky was grey. Visiting Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I told my friend we would walk by the sea and sit by warm fires.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. People from long ago are not here. We do not know why they lived in some places. We cannot see what happened before. But computers can help us. We can make old places and people on the computer. We can change things like rain or people numbers. Then we watch what happens to these computer people."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
One day, a big male vervet monkey saw a new male monkey near his group. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he joined, the big male monkey might lose his important place. The big male monkey had a smart idea. When the new monkey tried to come closer, the big male made a loud noise. This noise means ""leopard is near!"" The new monkey got scared and ran back. The big male did this many times. But then, he made a mistake. He made the noise while he was walking calmly. 
**What Cats Catch**
In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor thought all cats in Britain might catch 100 million birds and small animals each year. But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: are there still enough birds? Yes, there are. People feed birds in winter, and birds have places to live in gardens. Cats catch many birds, but not too many.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, buffaloes leave their sleeping place. They move slowly and make noises. They go to the water and stand there for a long time. Then, they swim slowly, with just their noses above water. They spend the day eating plants in the water.
**Picasso's Painting**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish in a fishing town. The painting shows fish and a crab on a table. The fish look alive. The painting is flat and calm, like underwater. But it also shows a fight between the fish and the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting make it look a bit scary."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography
Photography is taking pictures. For 150 years, people have used photography to show life and what people do. Photography helps us see things we might miss, like small details or big views. It shows us places far away, like other countries or even space. Photos also show us important events and problems in the world.
Long ago, people made pictures on cave walls. These pictures are very old, about 35,000 years old. We don't know why they made these pictures. Maybe they showed hunting, or maybe they were for magic or religion. But pictures have always been important to people.
When photography was invented in the 1800s, people thought it was a new way to show the truth. The camera works like our eyes and can make a picture that looks real. People thought everyone could understand photos, like a universal language. But different cultures might see photos differently.
Today, we use photos to show what is real. We often say, ""This is my family,"" and show a photo. Since 1839, photography has changed a lot. Photos are now part of history. They show us what life was like in the past. Photography can also help change the world by showing important things. It helps us see and understand our world better."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry is like playing a fun but tricky game. There are no strict rules, but you need to be careful. If you want to start writing poetry, it's good to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination be free. Some people need to feel happy to write, while others write when they are sad. Some people write every day, and others wait for a special idea. All ways are okay if you listen to your own voice inside. This voice will grow stronger with time.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if needed. A character can remember something important to help the story move forward. Talking between characters is helpful because it shows different sides of a story quickly. A short story should be clear and exciting, with every word counting.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know what will happen next, but you learn as you go. In chess, you need a plan for the whole game, not just the next move. The same is true for screenplays. The more you write, the better you understand the story.
**Looking at Writing**
Speaking is natural for people, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons, but writing is harder. Writing systems were created by a few old civilizations and improved over time. Not all children learn to read and write easily. Speaking is natural, but writing needs to be learned carefully. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"I am writing a book, but I am not sure what to call it. It is not a usual story with a clear ending. I am writing about a man I met sometimes, but I do not know everything about him. I use made-up names for people in the story to keep them private. The man is not famous, but he might be important to some people. My book might help people who want to know more about him. I did not write down our talks, but I remember them well. I added some parts to make the story interesting, like historians do. I want people to enjoy reading my book. The people in my story are from a different culture, and it is hard to know them well. People are shaped by where they are from and what they do. I usually write about people from my own country because I understand them better. In this book, I show the people as I see them."
CPE_4,C2,"'POETRY RECITALS Today, there are many different types of poetry. Some poets write poems to read on paper. Other poets like to read their poems to people. This is called a poetry recital. Poetry recitals are becoming more popular. People can listen to poets at schools, festivals, and small events. Some poets write simple poems for recitals. These poems are easy to understand when you hear them. Other poets write complex poems. These poems are better when you read them on paper. Listening to a poet can help you understand their work. It is good to read the poem before or while you listen. Poetry recitals can make people enjoy poetry more. They show that poetry is for everyone, not just a few people.'"
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians often use spoken stories to learn about the past. But this can be tricky. When someone tells a story, it is not always exactly how things happened. The person telling the story and the person listening can change how the story is told. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change the story. The person telling the story might remember things differently because of TV or other people. They might think the past was better or worse than it really was. Feelings can make the story seem true, but they might be about other times, not the past.
**Animal Science**
Animal science studies animals in two ways. One way looks at how animal bodies work, like nerves and muscles. The other way looks at how animals behave and what affects them. In this second way, there are two groups: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists study how animals learn, often in labs with rats and pigeons. Ethologists study how animals act in nature. Both groups are now working together more. Even if we know how every part of an animal's body works, we still need to study how they behave. It's like reading a book; you need to see the whole page, not just tiny parts.
**The Social Sciences**
When students start learning about social sciences, they have two jobs. They need to learn what the subject is about and how to study it. Social sciences are about people and society. They are not just common sense. Each social science looks at a different part of society and uses special methods and ideas. These ideas help scientists understand more than everyday thinking.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. It was about order, balance, and beauty. A Roman architect named Vitruvius said architecture is about these things. He did not talk about how useful buildings are. The beginnings of classical architecture were simple huts in Greece and Italy. These huts were not artistic but helped shape later beautiful buildings. A classical temple might look fancy, but it started as a simple hut."
CPE_7,C2,"Lily and her sister kept her driving a secret from Chen. Lily drove around the area, sometimes making mistakes. Chen found out but was not angry. He was happy and planned a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday morning and come back by midday. Lily practiced driving more. Mui, Lily's sister, bought a map for the trip. Lily drove well, and even Mui was impressed. They reached the seaside and parked the car. Lily was careful about parking rules. Chen joked about the car, but Lily and Mui did not like the joke. Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Chen thought about Man Kee's future. He wanted him to have a good education and own many restaurants. Chen saw a ship with a telescope and showed it to Man Kee. He told Man Kee it was a special ship that would take them home one day. Lily and Mui joined them, and they all looked at the sea together."
CPE_43,C2,"Title: The Well
I read that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I asked you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket and climbed in. I told you to let me down. I forgot the bucket would be heavy, and you were not strong enough. You tried to hold the handle, but I fell into the well. I hit my head. I saw strange lights, like stars in cartoons. I was scared and then angry at you for letting me fall. I worried about what Mother would say. You called to ask if I was okay. I stayed quiet and watched you. You ran to get help. I climbed out of the well and hid. I heard voices and saw you with Mother, Father, and Arthur. Mother was upset. Father told Arthur to check the well. I hid in the shadows, but I left wet spots on the ground. I was scared they would see them. Mother was screaming. I felt bad. I wanted to trick you, but now it was serious. I needed a plan. I came out of hiding, pretending to be hurt. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I said I swam out and climbed up. Father asked me to repeat my story. I said the tunnel fell in after me. Father did not believe me. He looked at me like he saw me for the first time. He said, ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" and walked away. Arthur looked sad. He knew I was lying and worried about me. His look made me feel worse."
CPE_51,C2,"**Moving Day**
Susan is a widow. Her children are grown up. She is moving out of her family home. A big van is outside. It says ""Removers of Distinction."" Fred is the removal man. He is packing things in boxes. His fingers are big but gentle. His helpers are not so gentle.
Susan's house is nice. It has four floors. It looks at a small harbour. Susan lived there for many years. Her children grew up there. Robert, her son, is helping her. He is now an adult. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is careful with the piano.
Fred says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred says, ""Yes, they cry when the house is empty. But they are okay at the new place.""
Susan remembers when they moved in. The piano was hard to bring inside. It got stuck on the stairs. Peter, her husband, helped. They used a crane to bring it in through a window. It was expensive, so they could not tune the piano for months.
Now, Susan is moving out. She is sad but also happy. The piano is the last thing to move. Fred and his team carry it out. Susan, Robert, and Francesca laugh. They are happy it is over. They walk down the path together, laughing. Susan only cries tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"'Online Book Reviews for Everyone
The Internet lets everyone share ideas. At first, you needed to know a lot about computers to do this. But one thing changed: book reviews. Amazon.com, a big online bookshop, let anyone write a review. People could say what they liked about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a new idea. 
Each book had a page on Amazon. When someone wrote a review, it showed up right away. This helped people see what other readers thought, not just what the publisher said. Other bookshops did this too, but Amazon was the biggest. 
Many people wrote reviews every day. Amazon had rules: no bad words, no spoilers, and no personal attacks. But people could still be tricky. Some writers wrote good reviews for their own books using fake names. One writer, Lev Grossman, did this because he got bad reviews. He wrote good ones himself until he got caught.
Authors could also comment on their books. They could say nice things and even share their email. But Amazon did not always check if the comments were really from the author. 
Sometimes, people got upset about books. For example, a book about cheerleaders made some people angry. They wrote bad reviews, but these reviews disappeared later. 
Most people took reviews seriously. They helped others decide if a book was good. Some reviews were funny, like one about a children's book called ""The Story about Ping."" It joked about the Internet. But most reviews were honest and helpful. 
In the end, letting everyone write reviews was a good idea. It showed if a book was worth buying.'"
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
Today, we think artists must be different and new. We like art that is special and surprising. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But with new art today, we sometimes say it is not art. The media often say this, and we agree. We think art should be new, so we miss the old ideas in new art. We want artists to be special and different from us. In the past, people asked artists to make art for them. Now, artists work alone, and we get upset if they try to be like us.
**Picture This**
I will tell you a story and ask a question. An artist picks a text from a book. The text talks about many kinds of pictures. The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June
Artists often make the same kind of art because it sells well. People like art that is the same. Some artists try new things and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is trying something new. He used to paint still lifes. Now, he paints the London Underground. He likes trains and started drawing them in the 1980s. His new show has 40 paintings and drawings of the Underground.
**Extract from a Novel**
I am on an island with a few books. The villagers say only a sick person would come here. I am here to feel better. Only an old woman comes to clean the house. I am alone. I am not happy or sad. I think about memories. Art is not useless. It helps us see the world in a new way. Art helps us understand life. It is not to escape life, but to see its true meaning. Why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my school. I had won two prizes at school: one for Latin and one for doing well in exams. My father talked to my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't good?"" I asked, but I knew what he was thinking. My father usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""You have all those certificates. I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And they say you have the right personality - you can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, ""I think you won't want to join the family business now. You'll go to Oxford, and after that, you won't want it.""
Like many children, I felt trapped by family expectations. I wanted to try different jobs, but I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't scared of him like Maurice was, but I found him strong.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my father said. ""It's a pity because you have the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""You could always use me as a consultant,"" I said. My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and I took care of him. I loved Maurice.
Because the business was successful, we lived well - a big house in London, good schools, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always lively.
""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford,"" my father said. ""Then, if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making a decision now. My father controlled us this way.
So it happened. In my last school term and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on easy tasks. I became a smart student, with a little house, a small white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me. He took me to a village for a meal and a chat. My tutor said I might get a First Class degree in Law. I felt confident.
But my father needed me for one last job. It was the most important work the family firm ever had. ""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on them.""
I could see my father didn't understand my pressure. He might think I was betraying him if I said no. As he talked, I saw how focused and smart he was. He was a kind of genius, and I respected that. It made my plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello and his wife Lois bought a house in Pembroke Square. They thought it was a good idea, but soon realized it was too expensive. Simon had a good job, and Lois went back to work after having twins. She got a raise, and they thought they needed a bigger place with a garden and room for an au pair. They could have found a cheaper house, but Lois wanted a nice address. 
Lois decided one of them should take public transport to save money. Simon took the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He remembered his grandfather's house, where his grandmother took care of everything. But Lois wanted her career to be as important as Simon's. They needed both their salaries to afford their lifestyle.
One day, a woman named Venetia was very angry with Simon. She said a man named Brian Cartwright told her that Simon knew about a bribe during a trial but did nothing. Simon said it wasn't true, but he felt guilty. Venetia didn't believe him, and Simon worried she could ruin his career. He didn't know what she would do, but he was scared."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought people here wouldn't care about old houses and messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon know who you are. The garden next door has beautiful roses, showing it was loved once. I usually stay inside, but tonight I watch birds flying. I cleaned the garden a bit, and my hands hurt from the plants. My neighbor, Jaz, talks to me from her window. She writes books, and I sometimes read them because I teach English. Jaz asks how her writing is going. She says, ""In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time."" She offers to bring a drink. I don't want her in my garden, but she comes anyway. She sits in a chair and says, ""Teachers have holidays, but writers don't."" She asks about my holiday plans. I feel worried about the empty days. I say I'm going to visit my friend Ruby, but it's not true. Jaz asks about her book, and I say I like the title. I tell her to write about nice people. She gets upset and says, ""Get a life, Ann."" I think about my life, my work, and my old teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who once said, ""I've had my moments."""
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is about feeling connected to the past. We know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about the past helps us understand the future. Heritage is like a bridge from the past to the future. It is part of our history and culture. Sometimes, we may not like everything about our heritage, but it is still important. Heritage teaches us many things. In the past, people shared stories to connect with their history. Now, we use buildings and places to remember. It is important to keep these places safe to remember our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I wrote a book called ""Waterland"" about a place in England called the Fens. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty. But I learned they are not empty. The Fens are special and different. They are both wild and full of life. Many people find the Fens mysterious. I did not visit all the places in the Fens, but I imagined them. The Fens are not just a place; they are a feeling.
**Museums**
Museums show us real things from the past. Before, museums just put things in cases with long labels. Now, museums try to make displays fun and interesting. Museums want everyone to see their collections. They lend objects to schools and help people with memory problems. Museums have real items, not copies. This makes them special. Museums work with books and technology to make people excited about history.
**Architecture and Environment**
People have always wanted to keep things from the past. Today, towns change quickly, and this affects us. Some people want to save everything, while others think about the future of towns. People who lived through big events, like wars, want to keep things stable. Planners need to think about this. Change is not bad if we know how to manage it. Changes in towns show changes in our lives and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone to name a scientist, they might say Albert Einstein. People use his face to sell smart things like computers and books. Many people don't know what Einstein did, but they know he talked about ""relativity."" This is a big idea that is hard to understand. Einstein helped change how we think about science. He looked at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before Einstein, people thought space and time were the same everywhere. Einstein said they are different for everyone.
**Young Readers**
When we were kids, Lydia and I did not like books that won prizes. We thought they were boring. Our mom did not like this, but our dad gave us money to read these books. He also gave us some good books as gifts. Sometimes, we found a book we liked.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm said the start of human language is a big mystery. Many people have strange ideas about it. In 1928, Charles Caller said early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when scared. Some people thought these sounds became words. Language started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. People used it to talk to each other and for power. Sharing information was not the main reason for language at first."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Reviews are short pieces of writing about books or other things. They are often in newspapers or magazines. Reviews do not last long. People read them for a short time. Writing reviews is not easy. Writers must be clear and fair. They must think about who will read the review. Some people read quickly, others want more details. A good reviewer knows a lot about many things. They must write in a way that people understand and enjoy. Many reviewers also write other things, like books. For example, John Updike is a writer who also writes reviews. He likes to keep his reviews in books. Some people think reviews are not important, but they can be good writing. In the past, some people did not like professors writing reviews. Now, it is normal. Professors write reviews and books. This is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It is also good for professors because it helps them talk to people outside their work. Writing reviews is not the main job for most people. It is something they do along with other work.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his apartment. It was dark and quiet inside. Even after three years, he sometimes felt strange when he came home alone. When he first bought the apartment, he was excited to come home. He wondered what the apartment was like when he was not there. It felt like a safe place for him. He thought he should worry about things like burglars or broken pipes, but the apartment was always there, waiting for him. Sometimes it was tidy, sometimes messy. Ralph started to see the apartment as part of himself. He wanted it to change, but it stayed the same. Sometimes there were letters by the door or messages on the answering machine. He was glad nothing was broken or stolen. Ralph worked in a boring office. He looked forward to being home alone a few nights a week. After leaving work, he felt like himself again on the bus ride home. At work, he wanted to be alone, but at home, he felt empty. He read books or listened to music, but he wondered why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. He remembered a time when he felt stronger. After university, he wanted to improve his life but only wanted to survive. He applied for jobs his friends talked about. He followed them, hoping to be happy. He went to one job interview and talked to Neil, his boss. Neil gave him the job because he was the only graduate who applied. Ralph felt happy about this."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, ice-cream vans, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse. I tried to find a good place to watch. There was a special area for the race. People stood on both sides to watch the goats run. It was hard to keep the goats in order because they like to eat everything.
**Canoe Trip**
At the end of the day, I was scared about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in. We did not see any villages or huts all day. In the moonlight, we could see the cliffs. Our torch was not working well. We put in new batteries, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. Lesley saw a light, and we were happy. But it was just moonlight on the water. We heard loud water, but we could not see it. We kept moving.
**How to be Good at Presentations**
I am not good at making presentations. But as a managing director, I have to do it for my colleagues and big shareholders. How can I get better and feel more confident? 
You are not alone. Presentations need different skills than running a company. Many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince people, you must believe in what you say. Show your passion and enthusiasm. Do your homework. Test your ideas before. Ask colleagues about hard questions people might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and build to your conclusion."
CPE_64,C2,"Some things take time. You cannot hurry them. If you rush making mayonnaise, it will not be good. If you pull a tangled fishing line, the knot gets worse. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things we can do fast, like solving puzzles. But some things need time, like thinking deeply.
Sometimes, we need to act fast without thinking, like when a motorbike slips on a wet road. This is called using our 'wits'. Other times, we need to think carefully, like when fixing a car or solving a problem. This is called using our 'intellect'.
There is also a slow way of thinking. It is like daydreaming or relaxing. This slow thinking is important too. It helps us understand difficult things. When we have a big decision, like changing jobs, it is good to think slowly.
Scientists are learning that slow thinking can solve complex problems. It helps us see things that are not clear. Slow thinking is linked to creativity and wisdom. It is important to let our minds wander sometimes."
CPE_29,C2,"**Living in a New Place**
I am in a new place, far away from home. People here are very nice to me. There are about forty people here. They are scientists, students, and other workers. We all help each other. I can speak a little French, but not very well. I can talk, but I cannot joke. I feel shy at breakfast because I do not understand everything. I was scared to talk at first. I did not know which table to sit at. I was nervous, like my first day at school. I still smile a lot and get nervous when people talk to me. I feel a little sad sometimes because I cannot talk like I do at home.
**Meeting Elliot**
When I met Elliot, I was a new writer. He did not notice me much. But he always remembered people. When we met again, he was friendly but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at a show, he was with important people and did not see me. Then, I became a successful writer. Elliot started to like me more. He invited me to lunch. After that, we saw each other more often because I had many new friends.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
Alfred Hitchcock was a movie director. He said he did not care much about the story or acting in his movies. He cared about how the movie looked and sounded. He thought movies should make people feel something, no matter where they are from. If a movie is made well, people from Japan and India will feel scared at the same time. Hitchcock was very smart and knew what he wanted. He liked to make people feel excited when they watched his movies. He focused on making movies that were beautiful and made people feel something."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last 50 years. Before, there were not many charts or books. Telescopes were not very good. Now, there are many telescopes and computers help a lot. This is a good time for people who like astronomy. But, it is harder to find a dark sky now. Planes make trails in the sky that make it hard to see stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many things to choose from. New products come out very fast. This can make people tired and stressed. People want simple things in life. But, it is hard to find simple things because there are too many options, like many types of cereal or phone plans.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we go to McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition. The people who stay there are like us. We like quiet and respect privacy. We know each other but only say hello. It is nice to have privacy in a hotel."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
There is a play called ""Othello"" by Shakespeare. It is now in London. Before, I said something bad about the play. I said Ray Fearon, the actor, was too young for the role. But now, I think he is very good. The whole group of actors is very good. There are many exciting parts in the play. One part is when Cassio plays games with other soldiers, and it gets dangerous. Another part is when Iago tries to stay calm but finds it hard. A very sad part is when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The play is very exciting. You should see it.
**Lake Vostok**
In Antarctica, there is a big lake called Lake Vostok. It is under 4 kilometers of ice. It is very cold there. The water in the lake has not seen air or sun for 25 million years. Scientists want to study the lake. They want to find out what lives in the water. They are making plans to learn more about the lake. In a few years, they hope to know more about Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
Scientists like to learn new things. They want to know why they like to learn. They ask, ""Why do we want to know things?"" They think it is important to know if what they do is good. Science is a tool. People decide how to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Food is important and makes us happy. Cooking is fun and easy. You don't need a special day to cook. You can make tasty soup with carrots, leek, celery, and herbs. It is better than buying soup from a store. You can also make a nice chocolate dessert in five minutes. Cooking shows care and love. We eat together at parties like birthdays and weddings. We don't eat fast food at these special times.
**In the Elevator**
Alistair's office is messy. Papers are everywhere. He owns an apartment building, so he has a lot of work. He has many books and journals. Alistair is going to meet Mallory. She is always on time and likes things neat. Alistair wonders what she will think of his messy office. Mrs. Wilson cleans his apartment. She does not want to clean his office because it is too messy.
**Karen**
Karen wants to be different from her mother. When she was 12, her brother hit her eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but she was okay. The doctor said she was lucky. Karen felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty is a teacher. She is happy and sad about something she saw. She lives in a small village. Dr. Bailey is sick, and she is sad. He was her doctor for many years. He was kind and listened to his patients. Everyone in the village liked him."
CPE_59,C2,"Joanna's Lessons
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She also writes books for children learning the piano. Joanna is very good at playing the piano. She plays many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, a boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it for him. She thinks it is important to teach children how to play the piano.
Joanna wrote a book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World"" for children. She is very busy with concerts and other projects, but she still wrote the book. She believes the first piano lessons are very important. Joanna wants everyone to enjoy music, not just be the best.
When Joanna was young, her mother taught piano to many children. Joanna learned that music is for everyone, not just for talented people. She thinks everyone should try to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.
Some children learn piano quickly, but others take more time. Joanna is interested in helping all children enjoy music. She worries that some parents push their children too hard to be the best. She wants children to enjoy music, not feel pressure.
Joanna's books are colorful and fun. They have stories and CDs with music. She wants learning to be fun. Children can play different styles of music and use the piano pedals. Joanna says practice is very important. She practices a lot every day. She thinks practice should be planned and mixed with fun."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said, ""Easy writing is not fun to read."" Good writing is hard. In school, my essays had few mistakes because writing by hand was slow and careful. Computers make writing easy, but also messy. Emails are not like handwritten letters. They are quick but can be too strong in feeling. Handwriting has more care and character.
**The CD**
I looked at a CD. It was shiny. Mr. Warriston said, ""CDs are amazing. They hold a lot of music."" He showed me how to play it. CDs play music on one side only. I asked why not both sides. Mr. Warriston didn't know. He said it was a good question. He wanted me to sit in the best place to hear the music.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said if matches came after lighters, we would think they are better. People say electronic text is like the invention of printing. But reading on a screen is not fun. Computers make us read in small parts. Some books, like dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. Computers do not help us read everything together.
**The Office**
Charles walked into a tidy office. The desk was clean. Kathleen said, ""You need computers, Charles. This is too much work."" Charles liked the room but did not want computers. He and Kathleen talked about this many times. She was good with computers and helped him write a paper about them."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She knew Lancelot did not take sugar because she made him coffee many times. Lancelot was at work a lot now. Before, he stayed away, but that caused problems. He used to meet authors and playwrights for lunch. Now, he was very busy and had no place to park in the morning.
""This came,"" she said, giving him a folder. ""From that man in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It was a synopsis, not a first draft. Lancelot had seen a synopsis before and did not want another one. Ian Cuthbert got a lot of money to write this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but he was not easy to work with.
Lancelot read the synopsis. It was not new. He closed the folder. Ian's book was not coming soon. The synopsis was not good. Lancelot thought about a famous author who needed money to write each chapter. Ian got a lot of money first, which was not smart business. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a great talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre, but Ian did not do much.
Ian was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine, but it never came out. He had a contract with a fashion magazine, but he did not do much work. At meetings, Ian was clever but mean. Ten years later, Ian was not reliable. Lancelot thought ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake."
CPE_65,C2,"'Breakfast in England
Breakfast is very important for health. But a long time ago, people in England did not always eat breakfast. In old stories, breakfast is not mentioned much. Some travelers ate in the morning before a long trip, and sick people ate breakfast to feel better. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or rich people.
In the 1500s, more people started eating breakfast. This was because there was more food. Also, people started working at set times, often very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for rich people.'"
CPE_61,C2,"Photography
When a person takes a photo, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, ideas, and culture. In this book, we will learn how these things change the photo and how people see it. For example, when we look at a photo in a newspaper, we might think about if it shows the real scene or the photographer's idea. Is the moment in the photo important, or does it show something bigger in the world?
More than a game
For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves a lot. You need to focus if you want to be the best. You have to work hard and not get distracted. Sport is tough, and you have to do it yourself. Sport teaches me to work hard and be strong, but it also shows how to work with others. My sport lets me be good alone, but it is also a team game. Like in life, you can do well alone, but remember others are there too. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has shown me new things and places. But you also have to give up some things for these good things.
Tuning in
Some memories stay very clear in our minds. For me, one special time was in California many years ago. I was awake at night, listening to a bird sing beautifully. I don't usually stay awake at night, but the bird's song was so amazing. The bird's music made me think of jazz and Indian music. It felt like the bird was making up the music as it sang. I listened and enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always talked about birds. Birds are important to us. Paul Evans writes about this. A small brown bird is hitting the glass in a greenhouse. It is a wren. Some people think wrens bring messages. Others think it is just a bird stuck in the greenhouse. Both can be true. Wrens are part of British culture. Long ago, people watched wrens to know if they would have good or bad luck. Today, we see wrens in pictures and art in many homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, people still like wrens. A forest without wrens is sad. 
Birds are part of our culture. Long ago, people needed to understand nature to live. They made stories about birds. These stories change over time. For example, red kites were once common in London. People liked them because they cleaned the streets. Later, people thought they were pests, and they disappeared from many places. Now, red kites are protected and are coming back.
Our connection with birds is old. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also made them think of dreams. Birds are important to us because they can fly and sing. They make us think about freedom. Some people say these feelings are old and not needed now. But losing them is hard. Birds show us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because we lose not only birds but also culture. Birds like skylarks, turtle doves, and lapwings are in poems and stories. Losing them is losing part of our culture.
Stories about birds are important. They help us feel connected to birds. These stories are stronger than scientific words. They make us feel and think about birds. Watching birds is exciting. It is hard to explain why. Birds are special, and the stories we tell help us understand them. The wren in the greenhouse is like a puzzle. It connects the past, present, and future. It makes us think."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
A map shows where things are on Earth. It helps us see how far things are from each other and in which direction. Long ago, people used time to say how far something was, like ""a day's walk"" or ""a day's boat trip."" This told more about how easy or hard it was to travel, not the real distance.
People also wanted to know, ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, they used written directions instead of maps. Some maps, like train maps, do not show real directions. Early maps used signs to show important places. These signs were different in each place.
Making maps better has been a long journey. People used science to help make maps. They used a compass to find direction. They learned that Earth is not a perfect ball; it is a bit flat at the top and bottom. This helped make better maps.
Different people needed maps for different reasons. Soldiers needed maps to show land for battles. Scientists and historians needed maps for their work. Today, maps show many things like weather, land use, and more.
Making maps has changed a lot over time. Sometimes, old ideas stayed even when new ones came. Map makers had to wait for better tools to make better maps. Sometimes, they just copied old maps because it was easier.
Maps are important. They show us how people thought and worked in the past. Studying old maps is interesting and teaches us a lot."
CPE_35,C2,"'TIM RICE I went into a young man's nice room. The rest of the house was messy. The room had many records and a stereo player. The young man was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He was going to study history at Oxford. He wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I wanted to be a pop star for women, money, and fame. Andrew wanted me to write lyrics like Oscar Hammerstein. He played me his music. It was very good. I liked it. I had written a song before, but it was not famous. We decided to work together. I thought Andrew was very talented. I was training to be a lawyer, but I wanted to try music. Andrew had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo. I was not sure about it, but Andrew believed in it. I started writing lyrics for the musical. I missed a day at work to write. I did not know it then, but I changed my career.'"
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
People can talk to each other. This is very special. We use words every day. It is hard to think about life without talking. When people are together, they talk. If they are alone, they might talk to themselves or to their pets. Talking is natural for people, like making webs is natural for spiders. Spiders do not learn to make webs; they just know how.
**Climate and Weather**
The air around us makes the weather. Weather is important for animals and plants. Warm and wet places have many plants and animals, like jungles. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day. The sun and the spinning Earth make the air move.
**Coffee**
I worked in a restaurant. I served drinks and made coffee. In Melbourne, coffee is very important. I learned how to make good coffee. It was not easy. I thought I would not do well. But my boss was nice. He said, ""Making coffee takes time to learn."""
CPE_41,C2,"Art on TV
Why is TV not good at showing art? Painting and sculpture are good for the camera. The camera can show a whole art piece and then show details. But many TV shows do not show the fun and detail of art. Robert Hughes made a TV series called American Visions. He talks about American art. He is a good critic and has a strong personality. He had eight hours to show British people American art. I thought the series would show great art. But it was more about American history and culture in art.
Dealing in Metals
I worked with metals for 20 years. I was known for taking risks. Metals are not controlled like other markets. With luck and knowing the market, you can make money. Risk is normal in this job. The market was supposed to keep metal prices high, but it did not. More minerals are found, and prices are lower. Prices are half of what they were 20 years ago. I was asked to check a big company using cheap materials.
Extract from a Holiday Brochure
Abaco and its small islands are in the Bahamas. There are 700 islands from Florida to Cuba. Each island is different and special. To travel in Abaco, you need a boat. If your hotel does not give you a boat, do not worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat. Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World'. The waters are good for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands have beaches that go for 200 miles. At night, the lights of restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay are beautiful."
CPE_69,C2,"'Make Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
At the Bamboo Bike Club, you can make your own bike. Engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan run the club. You get a custom bike frame and a fun weekend of building.
The club is in Hackney Wick, east London. It is the only place in the UK where you can build a bamboo bike. Bamboo is a new trend in bike making. It started in 1894. But bamboo bikes are expensive. They can cost $2,995 or Â£1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes cheaper. They worked in a shed in Wales. They wanted to share the fun of making bikes. So, they started the Bamboo Bike Club. They have jobs too. James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.
The club has courses every month. You learn to pick strong bamboo and make strong joints. You use tools to cut and glue the bamboo. James and Ian help you if you need it. Many people who join are engineers, but anyone can try.
On the second day, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue. This makes the bike strong. Then, you add wheels, brakes, and other parts. The bike is strong and good for long rides. Ian rides his bike to work every day. James tested his bike off-road.
Bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They are unique. They are good for easy rides. The ride is smooth because bamboo reduces vibration. The bike is light and fun to ride.
The cost to make a bamboo bike at the club is less than Â£500.'"
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend worked at a big book company in New York. She found a book by Dr. John Gray. She thought it would be very popular, and she was right. Dr. Gray's book helps men and women talk to each other better. Now, Dr. Gray is very rich, and Dione has her own company. Many people in America like self-help books. These books try to make people feel better. Many books are not published because they are not special enough. Dione says a good title is very important for a book to sell well.
**Autobiographies**
An autobiography is a book about a person's life, written by that person. The writer should tell the truth, but sometimes they do not. They might leave out things they feel are too embarrassing. Some writers think they can show the truth better by making up stories. Sometimes, they call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories are about solving crimes. They show the problems in society. In these stories, the crime is like a bad feeling, like greed. Solving the crime makes everything okay again. In Hammett's stories, the world is not perfect even after the crime is solved. The detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is a little bit like a criminal and a little bit like the police. He is in the middle.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. He says that to write well about science, you need to understand it. Only scientists can write about science well because they know the rules. Gould says you should not make things too simple for the reader. You can use easy words, but you should not change the main idea. If readers feel you are talking down to them, they will not like your writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in London, it is very cold inside. The gym uses a lot of air-conditioning because it is very hot outside this summer. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic inside the gym. Many places use too much air-conditioning. Instead, they could use other ways to stay cool, like using natural light and air, or having thick walls to keep the heat out.
**Sundials**
Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun. A long time ago, people used sundials to keep time. Then, clocks and watches became better, and sundials were not used much. Now, people are interested in sundials again. David Harber makes sundials and says they are special because they connect us to the planets. Sundials are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I once saw older women painting flowers on teacups at an art show. They were very good and never made mistakes. I thought only very talented people could paint like that. But when I went to a china-painting class, it was different. The people there just wanted to have fun, and even the teacher did not paint very fast. Everyone was there to enjoy painting."
CPE_47,C2,"Title: The Wrong Country
Uncle found a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price. They would fly from Gatwick Airport and stay in Venice for twelve nights. They would stay at Pensione Concordia. 
Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book the holiday. The clerk said other people on the trip were learning Italian. But something went wrong. 
Instead of Venice, Keith and Dawne went to Switzerland. They stayed at Hotel Edelweiss in Room 212. At Gatwick, a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform checked their tickets. She said everything was fine. 
On the plane, they heard people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They had some drinks. 
When they arrived, a woman said, ""The coach will take us on."" But the coach stopped at a hotel. Keith thought it was just an overnight stop. It was late, and they were tired, so they went to bed. 
In the morning, they found out they were staying there for the whole holiday. Keith told the receptionist there was a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist said they were booked for twelve nights in Switzerland. 
Dawne described the man who booked their holiday. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who was on the plane, tried to help. She explained that many holidays have the same yellow-and-red labels. 
Keith and Dawne realized they were on a holiday with older people. They wanted a holiday away from the elderly. Uncle had said they needed a break."
CPE_48,C2,"'ERNEST SHACKLETON: A GOOD LEADER American business people like Ernest Shackleton. He was a polar explorer. Many people in Britain know about Shackleton. In America, he is becoming famous now. Books and movies about him are being made. The American Museum of Natural History will have a big show about him. Some American managers think Shackleton is a great example. They learn from his leadership. Shackleton was strong and smart. He had a special sleeping bag and stove. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, likes Shackleton. His company helps other companies with big problems. Shackleton was good at leading people. He made hard choices to keep his team safe. In 1908, he was close to the South Pole but turned back to save his men. In 1914, his ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice. Shackleton told his men to trust him, and they all survived. Shackleton planned well and listened to his team. He was flexible and ready to change plans. He showed courage and care. For example, he gave his gloves to a team member without any. Shackleton's story is about being brave and smart. People today admire his true heroism.'"
CAE_15,C1,"'In the forests of Madagascar, there is an animal called the aye-aye. It is a type of primate. The aye-aye looks for food in a special way, like a woodpecker bird. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue. The aye-aye uses its teeth and a long finger. Scientists wanted to know how the aye-aye finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson studied some aye-ayes at Duke University. He gave them logs with holes. Some holes had food, and some did not. The aye-ayes found the food without seeing or smelling it. They used their finger to tap on the wood and listened with their big ears. They could hear if there was a space inside the wood. This helps them find insects. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker and also like a bat because it uses sound to find things. It is also like a squirrel because its teeth grow all the time. The aye-aye can also open nuts with its teeth and finger.'"
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we know what their lives were like? We often want to write about our lives, but we don't do it. Hannah Renier helps people by writing their life stories. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. These books are about normal people, not famous ones. Hannah got the idea when she talked to her family and saw that many stories were being forgotten. People like to share their stories for their children and future generations. They also enjoy talking about their lives. One man, 62 years old, shared his story. He talked about his divorce and other hard times. He wants his family to learn from his life, but he hasn't let his children read it yet. He thinks they can read it after he is gone. Hannah sees that many people repeat the same mistakes from their childhood. Parents' words and actions affect them for life. Some people try to impress their parents, even when they are older. Hannah listens to people and writes their stories. She is not nosy and respects their privacy. People can choose what to keep in the book. These books are not for everyone to read, but for family. They help people remember the past. Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah writes the story and makes it into a nice book. The book is not cheap; it costs about Â£3,000. Many people want to do it, but the price is high. Hannah thought more people would want it, but mostly rich people do. They are the kind of people who used to have their portraits painted for their family.'"

I was 25 when my children were born. It was hard, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new music and clothes. This helped me with my job. I missed some things when they were young, like concerts and sports days. But now, I can take them on holidays. They like to come to parties and events with us. They think my job is interesting.
**C. The Politician**
My first child was born when I started my job in politics. My wife and I wanted to spend time with them, but my job is busy. I try to take my kids with me to work events on weekends. This way, they know what I do. More people in my job are bringing their kids to work now.
**D. The Writer**
My first marriage ended when my children, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I tried hard to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I lived next to each other for a while. It was confusing for the kids. Kate says I was there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I treated them like adults too soon. I wish I had more rules. I still worry about my children.
**E. The TV Presenter**
I was ready for kids at 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice house. We decided to have a child, Betty. Having Betty made me think about who I am. Being a parent is special. Sometimes it is hard, but when I see her smile, it makes everything better. A baby's smile is very powerful."

CAE_46,C1,"'Flying Without Gravity Journalist Tom Mumford joins students testing ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the young passengers it was a Boeing KC-135, made in 1964. But inside, it was different. It was a long white tunnel with lights on the walls. There were few seats, and 13 students from Europe and America sat at the back. They had worked hard for a year to be on this flight. The European Space Agency asked students to think of experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight. The plane flew up and down like a roller-coaster. At the top of each curve, the plane and everything inside became weightless for a few seconds. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than the Earth. The plane took off smoothly, but soon it climbed steeply. The engines were loud, and we felt strange. Then the engines stopped, and we floated. For 20 seconds, we moved in silence. We could not tell up from down. After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot made the plane fly level again. Gravity came back, and some students fell. There were 30 curves in total, giving 10 minutes of weightlessness for experiments. Dutch students studied a robotic cat to see how cats land on their feet. A German team looked at how metal joins in space. Students from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films. They hope these sails can use the sun's light like a yacht uses the wind. After two hours, we felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. One student said, 'It was unforgettable. I want to be an astronaut even more now.''"
CAE_3,C1,"**My Trees in New Zealand**
I am Jonathon Porritt. I wrote a book called ""Seeing Green."" I love winter. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is winter there. I had nine winters in a row. My parents bought land in New Zealand for me, my brother, and my sister. We could have it if we planted trees. The land is near Auckland, in a place called Rangitoupuni. It is not great land, but good for trees. I like land and farming. I worked in Australia on farms before. 
We started planting trees in 1968. By 1972, we planted all 70 acres. It rained a lot, but I was happy. Every morning, we got ready to plant. It was cold and wet. I had help from a man who knew how to plant trees. We used a planting bag for the trees. Planting was hard work, but I liked it. We had to make straight lines for the trees. I got used to the work and found a rhythm. 
While planting, I thought a lot about life and nature. I went back to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow. I worry about storms and droughts there. The trees are now 20 years old and doing well. 
In 1984, I took time off from teaching and went back alone. I wrote my first book there. I stayed in a small cabin. I wrote in the morning, pruned trees in the afternoon, and did research in the evening. I feel a strong connection to that place. It is special to me."
CAE_10,C1,"Title: Taking Care of Badgers
One day, someone gave me a box. Inside, I found three small badger babies. They were grey and had black-and-white stripes on their heads. They were cold and needed help. 
My husband Derek and I have a farm in Somerset. We help animals that have no parents. The badger babies came from a place where workers found them. Their mother was dead, and the babies were hungry.
I took the badgers into my kitchen to keep them warm. There were two girls, Primrose and Bluebell, and one boy, Willow. I fed them with a bottle. They needed to eat every four hours. 
After a few days, the badgers started to move around. But one day, Willow got sick and died. I was sad, but I kept taking care of the other two.
Later, a farmer brought me another boy badger. We called him Willow II. He was hard to feed, but he learned to eat sausages. 
The badgers grew up and started eating different foods like cereals, meat, and vegetables. They liked to play and go for walks at night. 
We built a special home for the badgers on our farm. It had tunnels and rooms for them to sleep in. Many people helped us build it. 
Now, the badgers live in their new home. They are happy and safe. Sometimes, they come to say hello before going out at night. This is their home now."
CAE_67,C1,"'Looking for True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet Dr. Toby Clark works at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass changes. Anjana Ahuja tells us more. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for Halley's Comet. But he also did important work with compasses. He found out how compasses change direction. This is called 'declination'. It is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors need this to use their compasses correctly. Without it, they could not find their way on the ocean. Halley was one of two men paid to do science in his time. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination. The trip stopped early because of problems with the crew. But Halley tried again. He sailed to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he made a map showing compass changes in the ocean. This map helped sailors for over 100 years. Now, Dr. Clark wants to celebrate Halley's work. He plans to sail the same route as Halley. He needs to raise Â£70,000 for the trip. Sir Vivian Fuchs, a famous explorer, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life. Halley was a great scientist and explorer. He also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book. Dr. Clark's trip will also have scientific value. He will take new measurements of the magnetic field. This will help update the Earth's magnetic field model. The British Geological Survey and the U.S. Navy will give him tools. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his work will fill in any missing data. Halley's journey was the first big science trip on the sea. He was the first civilian naval captain for science. Dr. Clark has the experience for this trip. He worked in Antarctica and sailed from Rio to England. The trip will have four parts with different crews. Dr. Clark is ready to spend eight months on this project. He says Halley's life gives him a strong purpose.'"
CAE_27,C1,"**Peacocks and Their Beautiful Tails**
Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show their big, colorful tails. The female peacocks, called hens, look at these tails. A long time ago, a man named Charles Darwin wondered why peacocks have such big tails. He thought animals survive by being strong and smart. But peacocks have big tails that seem to make life harder.
Darwin had an idea called ""sexual selection."" He thought hens liked beautiful tails. Another man, Alfred Russel Wallace, thought the tails showed something important about the peacock, like being healthy.
Today, scientists like Marion Petrie study peacocks at Whipsnade. They want to know if hens really like the peacocks with the biggest tails. They also want to know if these peacocks are better in other ways, like being healthier.
Some people think peacocks with big tails have fewer parasites, which are tiny creatures that can make them sick. But scientists have not checked this yet.
This year, Dr. Petrie is looking at the babies of peacocks with big tails and those with small tails. She wants to see if the babies of peacocks with big tails grow faster and are healthier.
A long time ago, a man named R A Fisher had an idea called ""Fisher's Runaway."" He thought if hens liked big tails, then over time, peacocks would have bigger and bigger tails. This idea means hens might choose peacocks just because they look nice, like Darwin thought."
CAE_66,C1,"'THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS Tom Cunliffe talks about his dream boat, 'The Westerman'. He likes boats that mix old and new ideas. In London, there is a big boat show with many new boats. These boats have new technology. My boat is different. It is on a small river by the sea. It looks old, but it was made last year. It uses old boat ideas and new technology. New technology helps make boats, but sometimes it makes sailing too easy. I like my boat to have a warm stove and a nice place to sleep. But I also like to do some work when sailing, like handling the sails. Some boats have big rooms like a house, but I think a boat should feel like a boat. My old boat, Hirta, had no electricity or fridge, but it was easy to sail. When I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I could not find a new boat I liked, so I built 'The Westerman'. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew the boat on paper. Then he used a computer to make it better. The boat is strong and has won races. It looks old but is made with new materials. It is a happy mix of old and new, and it sails very well. '"
CAE_44,C1,"**Relax and Feel Good**
Many people like to visit places to relax and feel better. We asked five people to visit some of these places and tell us about them.
**A. Henlow Grange**
I went to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired. My room was very nice. On the first day, I rested a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and stretching. The teachers were very good. I felt much better by the end of the week. They have many treatments like massages and facials. The staff were very friendly. Henlow Grange will add a new swimming pool soon. You can also ride bikes or walk in the garden. I felt happy and full of energy after my stay. I want to go back again. 
**B. Shrubland Hall**
Shrubland Hall is a big, quiet house. When you arrive, they check your health. They give you a special diet to follow. I lost some weight but felt hungry. The food is healthy, like fruit and salads. You can have massages and other treatments. The place is very calm and relaxing.
**C. Careys Manor**
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it is a nice old house. The food is very tasty, but not for people who want to lose weight. They have a gym and a pool. There is also a spa and a place for sports injuries. The area around the hotel is nice for walking.
**D. Cliveden**
Cliveden is a big, beautiful house and hotel. They have many activities like swimming, tennis, and horse riding. The restaurant has very good food. I enjoyed a massage and a facial. Cliveden has many things to do if you want to relax and have fun.
**E. Springs Hydro**
Springs Hydro has very good carrot cake, but it has many calories. The massage was very relaxing, and I slept well after it. The place is modern and has many treatments. Many different people visit, like families and friends. I would like to visit often."
CAE_22,C1,"**Natural Talents**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We are more than 98% the same in our genes. This means we are not very different from animals. Many things we thought only humans could do, animals can do too. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple sounds for danger, like ""leopard"" or ""snake.""
Art is something special for humans. But our early ancestors did not make art for a long time. The first clear human art is from about 35,000 years ago. This includes cave paintings and statues.
People say human art is different because:
1. It is not useful for survival.
2. It is made for beauty.
3. It is learned, not instinctive.
Human art does not help us live or have children. Birds sing to find a mate, but humans make art for fun or to share feelings. Human art styles change quickly, and people learn them. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn both.
Some animals, like birds, are born knowing their songs. But humans learn art from others. Art changes fast, like how paintings from 100 years ago look different from today.
Chimpanzees Congo and Betsy made paintings too. They painted for fun, not to survive. Their art was shown in a London gallery in 1957, and people bought their paintings. This shows that animal art can be like human art. But human artists often want to share their art with others, while the chimpanzees did not."

In the past, stories had brave explorers. Now, we don't see them much. But Charles Blackmore is different. He led a team across the Taklamakan Desert. The desert's name means 'once entered you never come out', and people call it the Desert of Death. Blackmore talked about his adventure at home. His team had four British people, an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers were actually truck drivers, which was a mistake. This team wanted to cross 1,200 kilometers of desert. Blackmore wrote about their journey. He left the Army after 14 years and wanted to do something new. His wife, Tina, was worried because no one had done this before. It took them 59 days to cross the desert. The team faced many problems: sickness, hot and cold weather, and not enough water. But they found water when they needed it. They did not face sandstorms or very cold weather. The sand got everywhere, and climbing dunes was hard for them and the camels. Blackmore wanted to survive. They had no backup plan. No planes flew over them. They were alone. Blackmore was scared at first but kept going. At the end, they were tired but strong. Blackmore thought about his family during the trip. He is proud of the adventure but values his family more. He still wants challenges and misses the adventure. He finds modern life hard because it is the same every day."

The first idea says sleep helps our body stay healthy. When we sleep, our body fixes itself and gets ready for the next day. The second idea says sleep helps us learn. When we sleep, our brain remembers what we learned during the day. The third idea says sleep gives us energy. We sleep to get more energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"**Eccentrics**
An eccentric is a person who acts differently from others. They do not follow what most people do. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many people have small, strange habits. Some like to enter newspaper contests, collect beer mats, or write letters to newspapers about many topics. Being eccentric means being unique.
Inside us, we have two feelings. One wants us to be different, and the other wants us to be like everyone else. Most people want to be accepted and loved, so they choose to be like others. People with unusual hobbies or ideas often find others like them. They make clubs and have meetings to talk about their interests. They feel better when they are with others who understand them.
Sometimes, we want to show we are different. We might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as I am."" We can choose to be different and show our personality. Some people become famous by doing this, like Bob Dylan, a singer. He said, ""When you know what you want and go for it, people might not understand you.""
But being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. If a singer wears strange clothes to get attention, or a person says shocking things to be noticed, they are not eccentric. They are only eccentric if they keep doing these things naturally, without thinking about it.
True eccentrics do not try to be strange; they just are. They do not care what others think. They do things because it is who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives without worrying about what others think."

She wrote many books. Her book, The Home of Man, is about the growth of cities and sustainable development. It is my favorite book.
B. Linda Bennett
I love the book Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen. It is about how animals communicate. The book has words and pictures. It helps you understand bird colonies. Niko Tinbergen worked with artist Eric Ennion. Ennion's paintings show bird behavior with simple lines and colors. This book is great for people who love wildlife.
C. Lee Durrell
My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is my favorite book. It influenced my life a lot. It helped me love nature more. I read it when I was in Madagascar studying animals. The book made me happy and hopeful. It shows animals and people living together. It teaches us that all living things are connected.
D. Bruce Pearson
I found The Shell Bird Book by James Fisher in my school library. It has beautiful bird paintings by Eric Ennion. I loved the pictures and learned to draw birds. The book has information about birds and their history. It helped me appreciate birds and nature more. It showed me that art and nature can go together."
CAE_37,C1,"Title: Do Reviews Help Sell Books?
We asked five important British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:
Publisher A: Reviews are very important for selling books. Many people buy books because of reviews. Both authors and publishers feel sad if there are no reviews. But publishers think any review, good or bad, can help sell books. They like reviews that agree with their own thoughts about the book.
Publisher B: Publishers and newspapers both like book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Reviews are better now than 40 years ago. Paperbacks often do not get enough attention. Reviews help people know about books and can increase sales.
Publisher C: Reviews are very important for us. We do not have famous authors, so we need reviews to help sell our books. Good reviews are better than advertisements. They help readers trust the book. Reviews can help a book become popular, but they need help from other things like word-of-mouth and good marketing.
Publisher D: In the US, one review can make a book popular. In Britain, it is different. Sometimes, it takes many years for people to notice a good book. Some books sell well even without good reviews. Non-fiction reviews often talk more about the subject than the book.
Publisher E: Publishers and writers want good reviews. But sometimes, if reviews are too detailed, people do not buy the book because they feel they already know it. The reviewer's name used to matter more. Now, it is more about how interesting or funny the review is."

'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.' The most common weathervane design is a cockerel. But Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick. He made it as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 'I saw that I could make many different designs,' he says. Graham decided to start a weathervane business. He used to work as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed roles. She went to work, and he stayed home to look after the children and build the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job was not creative, but this is fun and artistic,' he says. 'I love designing.' Graham has made over 100 original designs. He works with fine details and always shows the design to the customer before cutting it. Graham also keeps traditional designs because they are popular. 'People like handmade things,' Graham says. 'They want something different.' Graham does not want to make his business bigger. He likes it as a small craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I enjoy making them,' he says. 'For a long time, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want special touches for their homes. This helps my craft.' Graham is very busy now. He sends flat-packed weathervanes to customers all over the world. Many buyers are from America and Denmark. 'The price,' he says, 'depends on how detailed the design is.'

Before it was published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was a very popular book. It is the first book by British writer Nicholas Evans. He made a lot of money from it. Here, he talks about his ideas and success.
At the start of the year, things were not good for Nicholas Evans. He is a writer and producer. A movie he was working on stopped suddenly. He was worried because he had not made money for two years. The bank was also unhappy with him. 
Instead of getting a job, Evans decided to write a book. He went to America for three months to learn more for his book. He got the idea from a man he met in Dartmoor. The man told him about a horse that changed after a gypsy talked to it. These people are called ""horse whisperers.""
Evans wanted to write a movie script but decided to write a book instead. He traveled in the US, learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about money. 
By August, he wrote half of the book. He showed it to a friend who said it was ""fine."" The friend thought Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts. He wrote a summary of the rest of the book.
In October, the book was sent to publishers. Soon, his agent got an offer of $75,000. Evans was surprised. In a week, the book was sold for a lot of money in the UK and the US. It was a record for a first book. 
Hollywood also wanted the book. Evans got $3 million for the movie rights. He was very surprised. He did not want to write the movie script because he wanted to stay in control.

CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
**A.** Volunteer tourism is when people travel to help build homes or schools. They pay money to do this work. This money could help more if given directly to the local community. Many young people volunteer during their gap year. They may not have special skills. Some people think they volunteer to help their careers, not just to help others. But, volunteering can help people learn to be kind and fair in their lives.
**B.** Volunteering can help people from different countries understand each other better. It can help solve problems and make people work together. Volunteers and the communities they help can both benefit. But, if only rich people can volunteer, it might not help poor communities much. Rich volunteers might only use the experience to help themselves.
**C.** Sometimes, volunteering can be more about helping oneself than helping others. But, it can also be a good way to share skills and learn about different cultures. Volunteering can make people care more about fixing problems like poverty and unfairness.
**D.** Volunteer tourism is about helping others in small ways. It is not about big government or big business. It is about personal acts of kindness. But, it might not change big problems in poor areas. Some people think volunteer tourism is just simple charity. It is important to remember that real change needs more than just individual acts."
CAE_55,C1,"'Choosing a Clock Radio Stuart Harris reports Many people use a radio to wake up in the morning. A clock radio helps us get out of bed. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios. One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. It also has a cassette player, so you can listen to your own music. The radio quality is good, but it is big. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his table for his keys and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case. This model was the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges liked it, but the clock sometimes stopped at 16.00. The digital display is nice, and the snooze button is easy to use. The clock has a backup power, so you don't need to reset it if the power goes out. But it is hard to set up. Tom Granger did not like a model with a built-in lamp. The lamp is hard to use, and the clock was difficult to set. The radio was also hard to tune. The buzzer is loud, like on a submarine. This model is popular with young people because of its bright colors. It was easy to set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges did not like this. The simplest and cheapest model was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning. Tom Granger liked this because it is easy to set up. The radio quality is okay, and the buzzer works well. It got me out of bed quickly!'"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many places, but not in America or Australia. When a hedgehog is scared, it can roll into a ball. This helps protect it because the spines point out. Some hedgehogs in the desert have fewer spines. They might try to run away first and roll into a ball only if needed. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They sleep under bushes or in holes. Hedgehogs can sleep all winter, but some do not if the weather is nice."

CAE_34,C1,"'The day I met Picasso Richard Cork remembers meeting a famous artist, Picasso, when he was 18 years old. Richard was traveling in Europe and Morocco before starting university. He had no money, so he worked painting boats. One day, he saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. Richard was surprised because Picasso usually stayed alone, working in the hills. Richard's friend told him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Richard was nervous but asked Picasso to sign his sketchbook. Picasso signed it and drew a little picture too. Richard was very happy. Richard's friend said he should draw Picasso's portrait. Richard went back to Picasso's table and started drawing him. Picasso made funny faces, but then he sat still for Richard to draw. Richard noticed Picasso looked strong and young for his age. After Richard finished, Picasso wanted to see the drawing. Richard was shy but showed it to him. Picasso then drew a funny picture of Richard on the same page. Richard asked Picasso to sign it, but Picasso said he already signed once. Richard felt lucky to meet Picasso and get his attention.'"
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you wanted? Stores use tricks to make you buy more. Here are some of them:
**A. Fresh Look**
Supermarkets know people like fresh food. They put fruits and vegetables at the front of the store. They might also have a bakery with the smell of fresh bread. The store might use green colors because green means fresh. Most things in the store, like frozen food, are not fresh.
**B. Good Display**
Where things are in the store is important. Supermarkets know where people look the most. They put expensive or fast-selling things there. Shelves at eye level are the best for selling. Special offers are in big bins. They also put things that go together, like salad dressing near salads.
**C. Spread Out**
Supermarkets put cheap things like bread and tea far from the entrance. You have to walk past other things that might tempt you. Stores put popular items far away so you see other things on the way.
**D. Less is More**
Some stores show fewer items to look special. Next stores do this. They make clothes look exclusive, but they are not. Itâ€™s about good store design.
**E. Total Price**
People care more about the total bill than each itemâ€™s price. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They might sell some things cheap to get you in the store. They buy in big amounts to get discounts.
**F. Price Tags**
In chain stores, people notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference. It also helps stop theft because staff have to give change.
**G. Lighting**
Stores use special lights. Chain stores want natural light so clothes look the same outside. Supermarkets use lights to make food look better.
**H. Walking Paths**
Stores use different carpets to guide you. Some paths lead you through the store. Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas.
**I. In-Store Ads**
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of food. In the US, some trolleys have screens that show ads. These ads change as you move through the store. They make people buy more."

CAE_8,C1,"**A Simple History of the Apple**
**Old Apples**  
People have eaten apples for a very long time. In ancient times, people in places like Switzerland and Italy ate small wild apples. These apples were not like the ones we eat today.
**Apples in Britain**  
Around 1000 AD, the French learned how to grow good apples from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. British monks worked on making new kinds of apples. These apples are the ancestors of many apples we have now.
**Popular Apples**  
In the 1200s, some apples became popular in Britain. One was the Old English Pearmain, which looked like a pear. Another was the Costard, used for cooking. But then, fewer apples were grown because of problems like droughts and wars. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn more about apples. He brought back new apple types and started a big apple farm in Kent.
**Apples Around the World**  
By the 1700s, apples were very popular in Britain. People took apples with them when they moved to places like Canada, the US, Australia, and South Africa. A man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees in America.
**New Apples**  
In the 1800s, new apples were discovered. In Iowa, a farmer found a new apple and called it 'Delicious'. In Australia, a woman named Maria Smith found a new green apple. It became known as the 'Granny Smith' apple.
**Apples Today**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from just a few types. People want more different kinds of apples. It is important to keep many types of apples alive for everyone to enjoy."

CAE_30,C1,"'Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He visits a training camp in Kenya. The camp is in a place called Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya. Richard has trained in Kenya before, but this time he trains with Kenyan runners. He also runs in a race in Nairobi. Many Kenyan runners are very good because they train at high places. This helps them run better because they get more red blood cells. Richard learns that Kenyan runners have a simple way of training. They run three times a day. In the morning, they run slowly. Later, they do fast running exercises. In the afternoon, they run again. They live simply, with basic food like tea, bread, eggs, and a dish called ugali. They also enjoy running and competing. Richard thinks the simple life and hard training help Kenyan runners become the best in the world.'"
CAE_7,C1,"**Mass Marketing and Advertising**
Advertising is having problems. It is not just because of the bad economy. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the economy got worse. The problem is bigger and is happening everywhere. Advertising has not changed with the times. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but now there are many brands and media. This means markets are smaller. Big brands should focus on small groups, but they often do not. This is where advertising is going wrong.
Think about when you shop. You might buy 30 to 50 things at the supermarket. Many of these are not advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. In a year, you might buy a few hundred brands. Big items like cars? Maybe one every three years. Clothes? Not many are advertised brands. Even with candy, medicine, and services, you probably buy less than 400 brands a year.
There are 32,500 advertised brands, but most people only buy 400. This means a lot of advertising is wasted. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for things you buy. For most people, it is about 1 in 16 ads. This means 15 out of 16 ads are wasted.
People think they do not pay attention to ads, but everyone sees them. Most people do not buy the brands they see. Waste is part of advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. But advertising still works because it reaches many people. Advertisers do not know who will buy, so they show ads to many people.
Smart targeting can help reduce waste. Advertisers can try to reach the right people, but they can never be sure who will respond. Even direct mail does not get a 100% response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might sell to everyone they talk to.
If an advertiser gets one million new customers, it is very good. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million new customers. An ad campaign that gets 2% of people to buy is very successful. This is a small part of the population. To succeed, advertising needs to focus more on the right people."

He believed these photos showed real fairies. He wrote an article and showed the photos, saying fairies were real. In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They cut pictures of fairies from a book and put them with flowers. The photos looked very nice. But this simple trick shows that cameras can lie. Today, we can change photos with computers. Cameras have always been able to change what is real.'"
CAE_11,C1,"'Blacksmiths Iron is a strong metal. People have used it for many years. Blacksmiths are people who work with iron. They make things like weapons, armor, and tools. Long ago, blacksmiths were very important. They were like doctors because they made things people needed. Blacksmiths also made art. They made beautiful ironwork for buildings like St Paul's Cathedral. But in the 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths in Britain. Big factories did not need them anymore. But now, people like ironwork again. They use it in homes and buildings. Some blacksmiths make new and different things. There is an exhibition in Surrey, England. It shows ironwork by blacksmiths. Alan Dawson is part of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association. He says blacksmiths can now use power tools. This makes their work easier. They can make many things like bookends and staircases. Some pieces cost a lot of money. The money helps blacksmiths and their association. Alan Dawson made a big gate and a lamp. He says working with iron is like drawing with metal. Iron is hard to work with. It is soft when hot but hard when cold. Susan May, a jeweler, likes this about iron. Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles.

CAE_14,C1,"'THE DAY I STOPPED SMOKING I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my friends was very angry. 'Why didn't you stop years ago if it was so easy?' she asked. I couldn't explain how I went from smoking every day to not smoking in just four hours. It was strange to me too. I went to a stop-smoking session with a group and a therapist. This happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I didn't like the pressure from people who don't like smoking. I was healthy and didn't feel sick. I went to the session in Birmingham to write an article about people trying to stop smoking. I said, 'I won't try to stop. I'm here to write, not to stop smoking.' I liked smoking. It made me happy. The therapist looked at me like he knew something. We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. But when they told us to smoke, I didn't want to, and others didn't either. The idea of stopping smoking started to make sense. It felt good to think about not being a smoker. It was a secret feeling just for me. Could I do more things too? Stopping was not too hard. The need for nicotine went away after a few days. I thought working without smoking would be hard, but it wasn't. Being at home on weekends was the hardest. Smoking was something to do when I was bored. I miss smoking, but not too much. Doing things without smoking, like eating out or waiting for a plane, is new for me.'"
CAE_63,C1,"Dorothy Hodgkin was a British scientist. She is the only British woman to win a Nobel Prize in science. Many people in Britain do not know her name.

Dorothy was not just a scientist. She had a family too. She had three children and a husband who was often away for work. She managed to balance her work and family life well.
Some people think scientists' lives are not interesting, but this is not true. Scientists can have exciting lives, just like artists or writers. Books about scientists are becoming more popular now. They show that scientists are real people with families and hobbies.
It is important to know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. They have done important work that helps us today. Learning about their lives can be interesting and inspiring."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Special Skill
Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a business to drill wells. They use machines, but to find water, Margaret only needs her stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.
This skill is called dowsing. Some people think it is like a 'sixth sense'. There are different ideas about how it works. Some say it is because everything vibrates, and water vibrates more. Dowsers, like Margaret, can feel these vibrations. Some say they can even smell water.
Margaret is very busy, especially when there is little rain. Many of her customers are farmers. Others have holiday homes or golf courses. Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and not near waste. The well also needs to be close to electricity for the pump.
Margaret starts by looking at a map with a pendulum. The pendulum swings over places with water. Then, she walks with her stick to find the exact spot. When she is over water, she feels something special. The stick moves up when water is below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows.
Margaret and her husband both check the spot. If they do not agree, they keep looking. Margaret's skill is not common, but it helps her family business. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This skill helps her find water and keep their business going."

CAE_42,C1,"'Georgina McGuiness stopped working in journalism for a long time. She felt she did not know much about new technology. She tells us how she changed her home to work better. Two years ago, at Christmas, she turned 37. She thought it was time to start her career again. Her old skills were from the 1980s, using a typewriter. She did not know how to use a computer. Many jobs wanted people who knew desktop publishing, but she did not. She was afraid of technology, even simple things like calculators. She thought it would be hard to work again before her children grew up. Then, she entered a competition in a newspaper and won a computer package. Her family got a laptop and a personal computer. They learned new words like Internet and surfing. They talked to people online from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and Georgina made a small office in the kitchen. She had a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem. She could work from home and still take her children to school. The children were good with computers because they learned at school. Georgina was scared she would lose her work if she pressed the wrong button. But she learned the basic skills she needed. It was easy and made sense. She started writing for a magazine, two articles a month. She was happy she could work and be with her family. The computer helped her be organized. She used spreadsheets to keep track of money. She could find information online and talk to other journalists. But working from home can be lonely. There are distractions, like housework and sharing the computer with her children. Many people now have computers at home. They like not having to travel to work. A report says the average computer user is 38 years old and well-educated. Most have a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM and modem. Georgina feels she is doing well. She hopes to send her work to newspapers or start her own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless.'"

CAE_54,C1,"'The end of print newspapers might take a long time. Change can be scary for some people. But change can also be good. Newspapers are changing to online. This change is not easy. Many people think print newspapers will stop because more people read news online. Print newspaper sales are going down. But their websites have more visitors. This is true in some places. But in other places, print is still strong. For example, in Asia, more people are buying newspapers. Magazines are also doing well. They sold more last year. Books are interesting too. E-readers like Kindle are popular. But people still buy paper books. Both are important. Young people still read newspapers. In the UK, fewer people buy newspapers. But in Germany and France, the drop is smaller. Different countries have different stories. Online ads were supposed to help newspapers. But now, online ads are not making as much money. Many US newspapers ask people to pay to read online. They also sell print and online together. Print is important for selling online news. Print ads make more money than online ads. This is hard for newspapers because they need to do both print and online. But print is still important for newspapers.'"
CAE_32,C1,"**Taking Photos of People**
People are very interesting to take photos of. A photo with a person is usually more interesting than one without. But, taking good photos of people can be hard. You need to think about how they move and their faces. Sometimes, people act differently when they see a camera.
**A. Group Photos**
When taking photos of a group, don't make them stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand in different ways. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces.
**B. Posing for Photos**
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax. Tell them to fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. Taking Photos**
Don't pretend you are not taking a photo. Most people will say yes if you ask. They might feel shy, so you can help them by telling them what to do.
**D. Eye Contact**
A photo is better if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. You can say something funny to make them relax.
**E. Looking at Something**
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the photo. This can make the photo interesting.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**
Faces and hands tell a lot about a person. A smiling child makes us happy. A sad face makes us feel sad too. Look for common expressions like a thumbs-up or a wink.
**G. Backgrounds**
The background can make a photo more interesting. Make sure the background is not too busy. Use a wide lens to make the person look bigger than the background.
**H. Interaction**
Photos of people talking or playing together are nice. Look for eye contact or a friendly touch, like a hand on the arm.
**I. People and Places**
Many photos are taken on trips. To show people and the place, use a wide lens. Ask people to stand close to the camera. Make sure you can see both the people and the place.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Think about why you want the photo. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose. For family photos, candid shots are more fun. They show real moments and memories."

There are rules that say it's okay to use pictures without asking if it's very important for the public. But people still talk about whether this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means these pictures are important for the media.

CAE_28,C1,"Acupuncture is a very old treatment from China. It is 2,000 years old. Acupuncture is part of Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine also uses herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture helps with pain. Some doctors and nurses use it to help people with pain.
In Chinese medicine, health means the body and mind are in balance. Energy, called Qi (say ""chee""), moves in the body. It moves along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians. Each one is linked to an organ. If Qi is blocked, the body can get sick. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulse, looks at your tongue, and asks about your health. They use small needles on the skin to help Qi flow.
There are over 300 points for acupuncture. The points are on the meridians. The needle can make a dull ache or tingling feeling. This means the needle reached the Qi. Doctors think acupuncture helps with pain because it blocks pain signals or releases natural painkillers.
Acupuncture can help with back pain, headaches, and other pains. It is also used in surgery in China. It helps with pain during operations. Acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular pain medicine.
Not everyone feels better with acupuncture. But many people do. It can take six or seven visits to feel better. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They ask about the weather and how it affects the pain.
Some doctors use traditional acupuncture. Others use scientific ideas. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. They should send you to a doctor if needed."

CAE_5,C1,"'Handwriting Can Show Who You Are Some people think handwriting can show a person's character. In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might need to give a sample of your handwriting. Companies use handwriting to see if you are right for the job. This is called handwriting analysis or graphology. Some people believe it can show if someone is sick or has emotional problems. Big companies use graphologists to look at handwriting for important jobs. But many doctors do not believe in graphology. Patricia Marne is a graphologist. She has worked for more than 20 years. She thinks handwriting can show if a person is smart or what job they should do. She says it can also show if someone might be a criminal. Criminals often have messy handwriting. Ms. Marne says handwriting can show if someone is honest or a good worker. She thinks it can also show if someone is under stress or has health problems. For example, if handwriting changes a lot, it might mean something serious is happening. Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to read handwriting well. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a real science. But some doctors do not agree. They think handwriting only shows how a person learned to write and does not mean anything else.'"
CAE_41,C1,"'Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for happy workers, says a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how good they are for working. We had three experts: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies how people work), and an occupational psychologist. Here is what they said.
Office A: Advertising Agency
Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple. There is no central heating or air conditioning. The windows open to the street. The team of seven people is happy and works well together. They make the office feel like home.
Ergonomist: The furniture is old and does not match. Chairs are not adjustable and some are broken. But the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations, which helps them not get tired or bored.
Occupational Psychologist: The staff like the variety of work. The office is the right size, not too big or small. It is fun and creative.
Office B: News Service
Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and the air is good. There is no smoking allowed.
Ergonomist: The chairs and lighting are good. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The office is a bit boring with grey walls.
Occupational Psychologist: The walls are empty except for some posters. Staff have been there for a long time and get along well. The office could be better if desks were arranged for easier sharing of information.
Office C: Bank
Building Health Consultant: The office feels like a glass case. There are smokers and non-smokers, but the air is not bad.
Ergonomist: The office is not exciting. Desks and chairs are just okay. Some computer setups are not modern.

CAE_38,C1,"Chewing Gum Story
Chewing gum is very popular. People in America chew 12 million pieces every day. Chewing gum has less than ten calories. It is a food, so it must follow food rules. 
Today, gum is mostly made from man-made materials. It has pine resins and softeners to keep the taste and make it feel nice. 
A long time ago, the Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the mastic tree. This tree grows in Greece and Turkey. Greek women liked it to clean their teeth and make their breath smell nice. 
In America, people learned from Native Americans to chew resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people sold spruce gum in the eastern United States. This was the first chewing gum sold in America.
Modern gum started in the late 1860s. People found chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic. An industry grew from this.
Today, few people still collect chicle. They work in hard conditions. They walk long distances in hot, humid forests. There are dangerous snakes and insects. The chicle fly is a problem because it lays eggs in ears and noses. 
Chicle collectors climb trees with a rope and an axe. They cut the bark to get the sap. They carry the sap to a camp and boil it to make gum bricks. Life at the camp is hard. They eat mostly maize and drink alcohol from sugar cane.
Now, companies use man-made materials to make gum. This is cheaper and meets high demand. 
Gum is good for teeth. It helps make more saliva, which protects teeth. Chewing for 20 minutes can help. 
Gum makers are always finding new flavors and textures. They use glycerine and vegetable oils. Most flavors are artificial, but some need natural help. 
In America, a large area grows mint for the two most popular gums in the world."

FCE_13,B2,"Many trees fell down in the big storm in March. In the town of Brackham, two big lime trees fell in the market square. This changed how the town looked, and some people did not like it. One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham. He is the head of the local police. But during the storm, Pelham was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and chest pain. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he did not listen. He thought the police needed him. This made him forget things and get angry easily. 
Sergeant Lloyd, his colleague, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. The doctor gave him medicine, and Molly took him home to rest. On Thursday, Molly told him the walnut tree in their garden fell. Pelham was too sick to care. By Saturday, he felt better and got up. He saw the living room looked different without the tree. 
Pelham's house is big with a nice garden. He liked the garden because it gave privacy. The walnut tree was nice to look at and made the room look good. Now, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked bad. The house next door was now visible. It was tall and had many windows. Pelham did not like the view. He said to Molly, ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" But Molly was happy. She said, ""We need a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,B2,"'Living in the valley We lived in our valley for sixteen months when we first saw the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, before winter, even before November ended. Before that, we felt safe in our valley with the hills around us. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt some strong winds; trees moved but the branches did not break. We knew we had to worry. The snow and wind were a problem, but not too bad. It was the river, the Ryburn, that was the biggest problem. It usually flowed gently, but it could be dangerous. Many years ago, people built dams to control the water from the hills. Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw big, dark clouds over the hills. They warned us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted as more rain came from the clouds. The reservoir in the hills was filling up and was almost too full. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river was wild near our home, just a few meters from our cottage. It was deeper than we had ever seen it, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, it did, and the water went down. Before the dam was built, the river often flooded the villages nearby. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, everything is okay. The water from the hills stays behind the dam, with only a little overflow sometimes. We can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel excited by the river's power. Thanks to the dam, we feel safe in our home in the valley.'"

He met Tom Seaton, who worked at The Front Page. Tom gave him the job. Tom wanted a team to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They had lunch meetings to choose what to write about. Mark felt lucky to be part of a new newspaper. He was surprised when he saw someone reading his review on the train. The team idea did not work, so they talked on the phone instead. People liked critics to write about one thing, so Mark chose films. He writes one long article each week about a film. He likes this way of working. He does not want to write about every film. He thinks people choose movies because of the stars, the ads, or the director. He does not think his reviews change people's minds much. He just wants to share his thoughts about movies.

But remember, only collect things you love. People have collected things for a long time. Long ago, people collected pretty stones. They wore them as necklaces. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are pretty. I have collected things all my life. I collect flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a faraway place in England. It was cold and windy. My parents took me to a museum there. It had many old things collected by people. I loved looking at them. Many people like collecting. Some people collect because it makes them feel in control. I collect because I enjoy it. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with many interesting things. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. You do not need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I once got a special tulip from another collector. But later, someone took it from me. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I found them all over the USA. But my collection was lost in a house fire. I was very sad. Collections can change owners. A silver spoon from a king or poet is special. Small things can become popular and cost more money. Toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, if you kept the boxes. I did not keep mine.'"

**Lisa - Exhibition Organiser at Science Museum**
I make exhibitions at the museum. I plan and design them. I also tell people about the exhibitions. I read about the topic first. Then, I talk to important people to decide what to show. I make sure people understand the exhibition. I plan fun activities and bring in engineers to keep it safe. Before it opens, I help make brochures to tell people about it.
**Janet - Teacher for London Taxi Drivers**
I start work at 7.30 a.m. I check the money first. Then, I make new maps for students. They learn routes for the taxi-driver test. About 50 students come to school. They find the best way to go. I help when they disagree. I give them a route and say the road is closed. They must find a new way. This helps them think.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**
I live by the sea and work from home. I answer phone calls and make learning materials. I also teach people about the sea. Sometimes, I take them on a boat to see sea life. This helps them understand better. I love my job because I care about the sea. But, I work for a charity, so we need more money. I can't do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**
My job is different every day. I make sure we have enough books. We have high standards. People write to us about maps. I talk with other publishers about new projects. I work with a great team. But, there is too much paperwork. This means less time for fun tasks like making new products."
FCE_10,B2,"'Our Holiday in Ireland We always went to Ireland in June. Every year, the four of us spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, own the house. They made the house bigger, but you can't really tell. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an ad when the Malseeds still advertised. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel our friends liked, but we didn't like the food there. The four of us, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I, have played cards together for a long time. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We think it's a funny coincidence. 'How very nice,' Mrs. Malseed said, smiling when we arrived this year. She always knows when guests are coming and waits in the big hall that smells like flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she told the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium.' These are the names of our rooms. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of numbers. In winter, when it's quiet, she does things like that, and her husband fixes things. 'Well, well, well,' Mr. Malseed said, coming in from the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he said in an Irish way. He smiled with his eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and we felt our holiday had started. Nothing changed at Glencorn, everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, making everyone laugh. Arthur took our bags to the rooms, carrying as much as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a bit but not too long because we were tired from the trip. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June, Glencorn Lodge is always full. From the window, we saw some people walking on the lawns and others going to the seashore. In the morning, we would do the same: walk on the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then come back for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. We always did this because we loved the beautiful landscape since we first came here.'"

Sometimes, people called or wrote to Seymour to see his factory. He helped students by answering questions or giving a short tour. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class. Marie's class visited the factory many years ago. Seymour showed them how he made gloves. Marie liked the laying-off table. At this table, men shaped and pressed gloves on hot brass hands. Marie called them 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.
Rita asked Seymour questions and took notes. She wanted to know about shipments and the tannery. Seymour explained that the tannery made the leather ready for them. His family worked in the tannery. He offered to help Rita visit a tannery. He said it was an old industry, with history going back thousands of years.
Seymour's father knew a lot about leather. Seymour said glovemen loved their work. He asked Rita if she had seen anything made before. She said she saw her mother make a cake. Seymour laughed.

Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and he jumped into the sawdust. He laughed and said, ""I dare you all!"" His friends were scared, but one by one, they jumped and laughed too.
Later, they went back up to the roof to jump again. Everyone jumped except Michael. He was scared and stayed on the roof. His friends called him a coward and left. Michael stayed on the roof for a long time. The sun was setting, and he was sweating because he was nervous. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped. He fell on the sawdust and lay there for a while.

He does not wear a white coat because it makes people think of pain. He wants people to feel relaxed and happy. Jerome uses virtual-reality headsets to help people relax. Patients watch a film about underwater animals while he checks their teeth. Then, they see a video of their own mouth. Many people like this. The office smells nice, like oranges, not like a dentist's office. Jerome says smell is important because the usual dentist smell can make people scared. Jerome is serious about his work. He uses warm water to clean teeth, not sharp tools. It feels different but not painful. Jerome learned new ways to help patients in the United States. He thinks making things easy for patients is good for everyone. A patient comes in, and Jerome gives him tea and asks what video he wants to watch. The patient seems happy. The office feels more like a nice beauty shop than a regular dentist's office.'"
FCE_39,B2,"Chocolate is a sweet treat that people love. It started in South America. Now, it is a big business all over the world. In the UK, people buy a lot of chocolate at Easter. They spend over Â£230 million. People also eat a lot of chocolate at Christmas.
Chocolate comes from the cacao tree. This tree grows in warm places like Africa and South America. The tree has big fruits with seeds inside. These seeds are called cacao beans. When they dry, they become cocoa beans. Long ago, the Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water'.
In the 17th century, people in Europe started to drink chocolate. They mixed it with cinnamon and sugar. Later, in 1826, a man from the Netherlands made chocolate powder. In 1847, a company in England made the first chocolate bar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.
In the early 1900s, the English company Cadbury made a chocolate bar called Dairy Milk. It became very popular. Today, people in the UK eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies now make chocolate ice cream and drinks to keep people interested.
Cacao farmers grow the beans to make chocolate. They work very hard but sometimes do not earn much money. So, when you eat chocolate, think about the farmers who help make it."

""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the next. I just needed one train ticket. Because I was under 25 years old, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from a bed. The train rocks you to sleep. Carrying everything in a backpack makes travel simple. Sometimes, I threw away socks and books when I didn't need them. This is the Inter-Rail way. You don't need to think too much. Just have a ticket in your hand. This train ticket lets young people visit many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I thought it was just a cheap way to go to a camp in France. But we wanted to travel more. There was always another country to see. And it cost us nothing extra. We liked culture, but this was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans and saw only easy-to-reach sights. We wanted to do something different. I liked seeing the view from the train station. We were there to have fun. We shared train floors, food, water, money, and music with other travelers. Travel is exciting because you see new places. A city is just a name until you see it. You understand Europe better by seeing it yourself. Other people's holiday photos are boring because you didn't see it. The train trip is a personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see it. But for us, it took time to understand this."
FCE_37,B2,"'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out your bags are not there. You might have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a place with a different climate and your clothes are not right for it. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens. Even good airlines make mistakes, and they cannot always make sure your bags are on the same flight as you, especially if you change planes. 
Airlines ask you to check in early so there is enough time for your bags to get on the plane. When you change planes, there is a minimum connecting time (MCT) to move bags from one plane to another. Usually, this works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems cause delays. This can make the baggage system fail. Sometimes, people make mistakes, or the label on your bag can fall off. These problems are worse at big airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. 
For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, and nine million changed planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing bags is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers go to Latin America.
To avoid losing your bags, choose direct flights if you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline and allow more time between flights. Label your bags inside and out with your home and holiday addresses and flight numbers. If your bags still go missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport.'"

There are old stories about kingfishers. One story says a kingfisher was a goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew high and got its colors from the sky and sun. Kingfishers look blue, but their feathers have no blue color. The feathers reflect light, so they look blue or green. Kingfishers are shy, but you can watch them from a hiding place.

FCE_23,B2,"**Theme Parks in Britain**
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US. We thought Fun Island might be boring, but it was fun! It is good for young children. Our three-year-old liked it. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special ride for very young kids, and it was a big hit. Older kids can try scary rides like Splash Out, where you jump in a pool! After five hours, we wanted to go home, but the kids wanted to stay. The park is clean and safe. The staff is very helpful.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**
We never went to a theme park before. We did not know what to expect. Oscar is young, but he loved it. He liked the Mountain Train and Little Land, with small famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and toy cars. We stayed for six hours. There are places to rest. The park is beautiful, and the staff is friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**
We stayed for seven hours and still had more to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus. We went on the Terror Line. The girls were scared but liked it. Their favorite was Running River. You think you will get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for young kids. The new ride, Fear Factor, was too big for our kids. The park is clean, and the staff is nice. A staff member helped us on a ride.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**
We arrived at 1 p.m. and were sad the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is good for young kids. The rides are not too scary. We liked Exotic Travels, a fun boat ride. We waited 30 minutes for Lightning River, and it was over fast! I did not go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun. Older kids might find it boring, but our kids loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and it is true. The Rocket is Europe's tallest roller-coaster. Ben thought it was scary. Jennie thought the Hanger was scarier. There are many rides. Older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. Some staff were nice, but not all. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We did not want to leave early."

Five women talk about their businesses in the countryside.
**A. Christine Hogan**
Christine Hogan has a computer design business. She makes over Â£200,000 a year and has four workers. She moved from London to the countryside with her husband and children. She wanted to work from home. Christine used to work with computers, so her husband suggested starting a computer design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. She is careful with money and tells the bank if she might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evening. Her business is small, and local people come to pick up their work.
**B. Maggy Sasanow**
Maggy Sasanow designs greeting cards at home. She studied art and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no jobs like that in the countryside. So, she started her own business. She makes 50 different cards and sells them to museums. She works in a big room at home. She does not advertise; people hear about her from others. She is cheaper than other artists, so people send her work from London. She misses talking to other people about ideas, but she likes being independent.
**C. Delia Turner**
Delia Turner makes curtains. Her business had good and bad times. She started eight years ago. Her business grew fast, but then the economy got worse. She had to let her six workers go, which was hard because there are not many jobs in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband and other women who work from their homes. She sometimes has to lower her prices and look for new chances.
**D. Tessa Strickland**
Tessa Strickland works on children's books from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside because London was expensive and she loves the country. She likes working when she wants. Most of her money comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at odd hours. It is hard to stop working sometimes. She works with authors and artists to publish children's books from different cultures. She used to feel alone because she worked in London before.
**E. Meg Rivers**
Meg Rivers has a cake business. She makes Â£250,000 a year and has six workers. She started at home ten years ago. She likes healthy food, so she made fruit cakes with good flour and eggs. Friends and family asked for cakes, and soon she sent cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building for her business. Now, she has a baker, an assistant, and a cake decorator. She does not bake anymore; she runs the business side. Her biggest problem was money because she did not have much to start with."
FCE_1,B2,"Meet the Watkins Family
The Watkins family loves music. The sons, Paul and Huw, play music and write songs. Their dad, John, makes musical instruments. 
When Paul was ten years old, he needed a cello. A cello is a big musical instrument. Buying a cello was very expensive. So, John's dad decided to make one. He went to a school to learn how to make instruments. After some practice, he made a cello for Paul. Paul used this cello for many years.
John stopped teaching and now makes violins full-time. He even sold a violin to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.
Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano, then the cello. He liked the cello because he thought the cello player in his dad's music group was cool. Huw plays the piano and writes music too.
Paul won a big music competition with his dad's cello. He also played in a famous orchestra. Now, he has a new, very old cello from the Royal Academy of Music. It is 304 years old!
Paul will play this new cello on TV soon. He will play a famous piece called Elgar's Cello Concerto. But he cannot watch himself on TV because he has another concert that night. Huw also has a concert the same night in London.
John and Hetty, their parents, are very proud and busy keeping up with their sons' music events."

Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, who works for the Trust. Gareth's job is to take care of the land. Gareth says you need common sense to do his job. You also need to be good with people because you talk to farmers, visitors, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his family's farm. Many people wanted Gareth's job, but he got it because he knows the area well and has farming experience. Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. He is strong and can do hard work like building fences and planting trees. Gareth has learned a lot about nature. He remembers picking flowers and collecting birds' nests when he was young. Now he sees that farming has changed the countryside. Farmers and nature lovers used to disagree, but now they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's job is to make sure work gets done well and cheaply. He likes finishing projects and talking to people, even if some visitors are not nice. Gareth loves his job and being outside.

FCE_50,B2,"'SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS What can you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents do not see their child's talent until the child becomes upset. Regular schools may not have the right help for children who are very good at music. These children might do well at a special music school. In Britain, there are five special music schools. These schools help children aged seven to eighteen who are very good at music. Children at these schools spend a lot of time on music. They have lessons, play in groups, and practice singing and instruments. They also learn subjects like English and math, but not as many as in regular schools. These schools are private, and classes are small. Most children live at the school. This means they are with other children who love music too. There are some problems. The schools cost a lot of money, but they try to help with scholarships. Some parents do not want their young children to live away from home. Some people worry that starting music school too young can be stressful. Music talent can change as children grow up. The schools watch the children closely and help them if needed. Some children are also very smart and want to learn more subjects. They might be happier in a regular school with good music classes. Some music colleges offer lessons on Saturdays for children who live near big cities. This can be a good choice for families who do not live near a special music school.'"

FCE_8,B2,"'Do you want to publish your story? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, can help you. Many people ask, 'I wrote a story. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to learn about publishers and practice writing. To sell your story, you need to know about the 'writing world'. Read a lot to know what publishers like. Visit your library and bookshops. New magazines and books come out all the time, so keep learning. Publishers want new writers. If you want to write love stories, find magazines that like them. Read these magazines to know what stories they want. Writers often ask, 'My story was rejected. Should I keep trying?' I say yes, but maybe the story needs more work. Many new writers send their stories too soon. If you wrote only one story, it might not get published. Successful writers often work for years before they succeed. When you send your story, start writing more. Write ten or twenty more stories. Each story will be better. Don't throw them away; make them better. Don't show your work to others too soon. Remember, many writers get rejected before they succeed. Try to join a writing class or group. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

Old couples with matching bags sat on the benches. Many college students sat on the floor with their bags. A man with grey hair was talking to people. He looked rich. He wore a nice sweater and a soft coat. 
He asked a woman if she was going to Philadelphia. Then he asked a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I thought I might talk to her too. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""No, I am going to New York."" The man said, ""Thanks,"" and moved on.
He asked an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Wilmington."" He did not say anything and walked to another couple. I was going to Philadelphia, but he did not ask me. Maybe he thought I looked unreliable.
The man looked worried. He asked a woman reading a book, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""Yes, I am."" He asked her for a favor. I pretended to look at my watch, but I don't have one.
The man said his daughter was flying out for a study year abroad. She forgot her passport. She called from Philadelphia. He told her to wait there. He wanted someone to take her passport to her.

But if you are new, like Jo, you don't know anyone. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. Dublin was a big unknown place for her. She didn't think much about why she was going there. Everyone from her school wanted to leave their small town and see more of the world. Some went to towns like Ennis or Limerick. But Jo was the only one going to Dublin. Jo's mom thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel. It was safe because nuns ran it. Her dad hoped it was warm because hostels can be cold. Her sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. Jo didn't know they were talking about her. She saw an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own TV, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was close to her work at the post office. She hoped it was nice and not too expensive. There was no line for this flat because it was more like 'Third Girl Wanted.' The 'own TV' part made Jo think it might be too fancy, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf was leaving and said, 'Desperate place. They're both awful.' Jo kept going up. 'Hello,' said a girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that girl leaving? I don't like her type.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'She just looked around, made a face, and said, ""Is this all?"" in a fancy voice. We wouldn't have her here, right, Pauline?' Pauline wore a very colorful shirt and had bright hair. Jo was surprised because Pauline was a punk. Jo had seen punks before but never talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work at the post office,' she said. Nessa said they were about to have tea.

Mark Simmonds talks about why dolphins are in danger. Dolphins are smart animals. They understand people and make us think of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love dolphins more. But real life is hard for dolphins. The sea is dirty and there are not many fish. One type of dolphin, the North Sea harbour porpoise, has fewer numbers now. We think there are 89,000 less than before. Many people think dolphins are safe and protected. But this is not true. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, we see striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. Striped and common dolphins live far in the sea. We do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be near the coast. Now, they are only in a few places in Scotland and Wales. They have skin problems because they are stressed. It is hard to know why there are fewer dolphins. There are not many fish because of too much fishing. Dolphins need fish to eat. If there are no fish, dolphins cannot find food. Dolphins can also get caught in fishing nets. These nets are hard for dolphins to see. Many dead dolphins are found on beaches in France and Cornwall. They have marks from nets. The sea is also dirty. Dolphins can eat bad things in the water. These bad things stay in their bodies. Mother dolphins can give bad milk to their babies. One baby dolphin died from its mother's milk. Noise in the sea is another problem. Dolphins use sound to understand their world. Noise from ships and oil wells can confuse them. We do not know how much this hurts dolphins.'"
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your body and mind. It helps you feel good when life is busy and stressful. Exercise is good for you, and there are many reasons to do it.
Exercise makes your muscles strong and changes your body shape. It helps you stand or sit well. It also helps your heart and lungs work better. Exercise can make you feel less sad and tired. It helps you sleep better and feel less stressed.
There are many types of exercise you can try, like jogging, lifting weights, or using machines. But be careful not to exercise too hard, or you might get hurt. Start slowly and ask a doctor if you are unsure.
Good posture is important. Stand up straight to look and feel better. Imagine a balloon pulling your head up to help you stand tall. Stretching your muscles helps you move easily and prevents injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine.
A good exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, working out, and cooling down. Do this four or five times a week for a healthy body."

When you meet someone for the first time, they quickly decide what they think about you. They look at your clothes, eyes, body, and how you talk. Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard and finished school. She went to a job interview at a school. She saw a small hole in her jacket but did not change because she wanted to be on time. Mary did not get the job. The Head Teacher thought she did not care about her appearance.
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says people who look after themselves will look after their jobs. In an interview, you should look your best. Some people forget this. Janet Goodwood worked in an office for ten years. She wanted a better job but did not get an interview. The boss said she did not look like a manager. He told her to dress better next time.
How you move and your face also matter in an interview. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian says only 7% of what we say is from words. The rest is from our voice and face. Make sure your face and words match. Do not look too eager or desperate for the job.
Sheila Rice, a marketing expert, got a job offer in an interview. She was very happy, but the boss saw this and gave her less money. She thinks she could have got more if she was calmer.
Before an interview, learn about the company. David Artesio, a job agency manager, says to talk about something you like about the company. This shows you are interested. Marian Woodall, a business consultant, says to ask questions and speak clearly. Use short sentences."

It's great to play tennis and have the crowd cheer for you. But sometimes, it gets too busy with fans. I like when fans notice me, but my last girlfriend didn't like it. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up. It's hard, but you must be serious in sports. I focus on my game now and will enjoy other things after I stop playing tennis."

I can't buy all these things. I feel bad if I say yes, and I feel bad if I say no. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to choose things."" Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on ads for children, mostly on TV. These ads make children want to buy things. Parents find it hard to explain why they can't buy everything. Ads make things look very nice. Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Parents care about what their children eat. They have ideas about healthy food, but they are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view."" TV ads can't tell children to ask their parents to buy things, but they still make children want to buy. Parents feel stressed when deciding what to buy for their children. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food. Her son is now critical of ads. They have fewer problems in the supermarket because the children don't ask for things she won't buy. Parents also say they are not always fair. Mike, a father, says, ""We say no to sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy chocolate for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and children want that too. But I still get annoyed when they ask for things. It depends on how I feel. If I'm happy, I might say yes. It's hard to always be fair."" Supermarkets can help by not putting sweets near the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less, but they would enjoy shopping more without their children's demands.'"

Emma Marsden asked six women how they stay energetic. Here is what they said:
**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I get energy from excitement. I like doing new and challenging things. Learning gives me energy. I am learning flamenco dancing now. Dance is fun and gives me energy. If you are bored, you feel tired. Doing something useful, even if it's small, gives you energy.""
**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. If you like what you do, you don't feel tired. I need a lot of sleep to feel good. Exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to start. I do yoga once a week and try to exercise at home. Exercise makes me feel happy. I feel tired in the afternoon, so I eat something then.""
**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I get energy from being happy and positive. I don't like negative people. I think we should enjoy life. I love my job and being around young people. I like taking photos and writing songs for fun. It helps me relax when I travel.""
**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and family. Being positive helps. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Smiling at people makes me feel good. I try to eat healthy and don't smoke or drink. I play with kids for exercise.""
**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
""I love making gardens. I once turned a concrete place into a garden. It was better than exercise. I get energy when people read my writing. I like exploring nature, even if it's private land. It makes me feel like a child.""
**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**

FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating is very old. People have skated for thousands of years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. Later, they used iron skates. In Scandinavia, rich people thought skating was important. 
In 1924, a girl named Sonja Henie changed skating. She made it more fun and active. Today, skating is both beautiful and hard work. 
When you start skating, balance is important. You need to control your body. Your legs should be a little bent, and your knees should be soft. This helps you stay balanced. Relaxing is very important in skating. 
To start skating, your heels should be close, and your feet should point out. Push with one foot and move the other foot a little. It is not too hard. As you get better, you can move more. 
Falling is part of skating. Everyone falls, even the best skaters. To fall safely, stay relaxed. To get up, use your hands and knees, then stand. 
Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating or speed skating. It is good to learn figure skating first. Many ice rinks have teachers to help you. 
Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, do exercises. Warm up your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees before skating. After skating, do the exercises again to stay loose. 
Skating helps your balance and makes you strong. It is good for your heart and lungs. Skating with swimming or jogging is great for your health."

People in Europe are getting taller by about one centimeter every ten years. More tall people are being born each year. This does not mean we are becoming a new super race. We are becoming like people from 40,000 years ago. Long ago, people ate many different plants and animals. About 9,000 years ago, farming started. Farmers grew wheat, rice, and corn. These foods are not very healthy. People became less healthy and shorter. In the US, Europe, and Japan, people are eating better now. So, people are getting taller again. In the US, the average man is 179 cm tall. In Holland, it is 180 cm, and in Japan, it is 177 cm. But there are problems. Beds are still the same size as in 1860.

FCE_57,B2,"'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a normal part of TV, but many people don't know much about them. We see them on game shows and wonder - who are these people? Some people think studio audiences are not very important. Even people who work in TV sometimes don't respect them. I thought studio audiences were just people who wanted to be on TV for a short time. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all kinds of jobs and backgrounds. TV shows try to get different people for different shows. Some people like to watch TV at home and don't understand why others go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and wait for hours in a studio to watch something you can see at home? Some think people want to be on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. She came because she wanted to be on TV. Others are curious to see behind the scenes. But many people go because a friend gave them a ticket. Not many of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager says, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a difference between watching in a studio and at home? Claire thinks sitting in a studio is 'more exciting'. Charlotte liked being part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night out.'"

There is a small train from Hythe to Dungeness. I like to ride first class because it is not much more money. The view is simple. The train goes past fields with sheep and a canal.

Then, I saw the snake escaping from its tank. The room was crazy with the cat, mouse, kids, and snake. The dog was barking too. I turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and came back. I caught Domino and saved the mouse. The mouse was okay.
Next, I had to catch the snake. I sat on the floor and waited. Slowly, the snake calmed down. I picked it up and took it to the garden. I wanted it to go to a tree, but the snake wrapped around my shoulders. My oldest child, DJ, said, ""Mom, you're warm, and the shed isn't.""

She always told me to write thank-you letters for gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy. When I was 18, I moved to London to study medicine. I wrote letters to my mother every week, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote too. His letters were funny and made me happy. The letters talked about everyday things. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more. I also got letters from boyfriends. Writing letters helped our relationships. I could say things in writing that were hard to say out loud. I like letters with birthday or Christmas cards. It is nice to get news from the whole year. I also like letters from other countries. I have friends in Sri Lanka, Australia, and Canada. I also have a friend in France. We met in a restaurant and started writing to each other. She does not speak English, so I practice my French. We have visited each otherâ€™s homes.

In France, there are very old pictures on rocks in the mountains. These pictures are 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and gods. Many people visit this place, but some tourists are not careful. They write on the rocks and damage the pictures. 
Jean Clottes, a rock art expert, says the pictures might be gone in 50 years if this continues. Some tourists even take pieces of the rock home. Others rub the pictures to see them better, which also causes damage.
Experts have different ideas on how to protect the pictures. Henry de Lumley thinks the mountain should be closed to visitors, except for guided tours. But Jean Clottes and David Lavergne do not agree. They want people to visit but worry about money for guards to protect the site.
Annie Echassoux, another expert, is worried because more tourists can now reach the site easily. She thinks the area should be closed off with ropes and have guides. She says money must be found to protect the pictures for future generations."

At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham, a French climber named Francois Lombard is climbing on a wall. The National Indoor Arena, where the event is held, is also known for the TV show Gladiators. Both have a big wall. In the past, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they walked or climbed in Scotland. To stay fit, they used brick or stone buildings to practice. Later, sports centers built special climbing walls. Don Robinson, a teacher, made a climbing wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s. But these walls had problems. They were only straight up and down. Real cliffs have different shapes. In 1985, Francois Savigny from France made new shapes for walls. These could be changed when climbers got bored. French companies also made panels with steel frames. These were lighter and could be moved. Climbers could have new challenges all the time.'"

Some friends might say you are crazy, but others might not. Everyone will give different advice. It is your choice, and you must be responsible for it. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and no guarantee you will get a job after training. You need luck and talent. People want new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous. Sometimes, it can also be rewarding. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. It is also about courage and belief in what you do. Why do people want to act? It is hard to say. In the theater, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is why actors love to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They know about their skills and others' skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their current job. Disappointment is hard for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work. Then, you get an audition, but you might not get the job. Actors do not talk about their chances. They find ways to handle stress and rejection. Nobody likes rejection. From the start, you must be ready for it. You say you are available, willing, and talented. It is up to you to care, because if you do not care, no one else will.'"

They planted many trees and bushes. These plants can live near the sea and in strong winds. Some plants came from nearby, and some came from far places like Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims made the village. He started in 1972 and worked for nine years. He made over 100 models. The models are made from stone, wood, and plastic. They can stay strong in any weather. Colin learned from experts and became very good at making models.
The models are all the same size and have lots of details. The village is very popular because it looks real and is well-made. Other places in England use the same way to make model villages.
The buildings look like old British houses. One big building is the Manor House. It looks like a house from the 13th century. You can also see a castle, a church, a zoo, and a mini golf course.
Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs can come if they are on a short lead. Some models have buttons. Press them to see the models move.

FCE_69,B2,"'Every week, British newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. Sometimes, pop stars let photographers take their pictures, but this is not common. Often, these pictures hurt famous people because they show private moments. There is a group called the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) that can help with this problem, but not many people ask for their help. These pictures do not help the public. For example, a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony does not help anyone. The actress was upset about these pictures, but she did not complain. The PCC did not do anything about it, which is surprising. They should also look at stories about pop stars' private lives. The pop star did not complain either. Shouldn't the PCC do something about these problems? 
If the PCC acted like a 'police officer', it would be hard. How would they decide to start an investigation? Should they ask the person to complain? And if the person does not want to, should they still do it? Also, famous people might think every story about them should be checked, and they might be upset if it is not. The job is too big. How can the PCC watch all newspapers and magazines in Britain? 
There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, do they want more attention from an investigation? Most people just want to forget and move on. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story they want to keep secret. 
One British comedian had his privacy invaded when he was on his honeymoon. He did not complain because he was afraid the newspaper would make fun of him. People are scared to fight the newspapers because they think they will be targeted again. This is a difficult problem to solve.'"

After college, I was a secretary. I was scared to speak in meetings. I learned to speak up. In politics, I was nervous to speak in public. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing notes helped me feel better. Everyone gets nervous speaking in public. Confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,B2,"'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. 'You can keep it,' he said, 'if the line breaks, you can keep the kite. I have many more.' He showed me a pile of kites. They were all 120cm wide and long, made of paper and bamboo. We sat under the trees near the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, Malaysia. We watched the big kite festival. In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms. Helpers held the kites, and people waited to fly them. When the whistle blew, the kites went up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition. It lasts five days every year. They showed four different kite designs. The kites were judged on decoration, how well they flew, and how stable they were in the air. 'Flying kites is easy,' said Adnan, 'but making them is hard. Come to my house, and I'll show you.' I decided to visit him. At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to fix his kite, but I couldn't. I drove to the south of the state, towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with rainforests. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. I saw a sign that said: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' The path was uphill, steep, and slippery. At the track, a man named Baba was waiting with tea. He had a tented kitchen and bamboo huts. I stayed there, trying not to think about insects. The night was very dark and noisy. A waterfall was nearby, and many animals made sounds. In the morning, I saw a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. The wind and lightning hit the trees. I got very wet. Going downhill, I thought about my car being washed away. But my car was still there, covered in mud. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' They were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for kites, but I remember it for the kind people.'"

Grass is a very successful plant. There are more than 9,000 types of grass. Grass grows everywhere in the world. It can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Many animals live in grasslands. Small insects, birds, cows, and lions all need grass. Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. New leaves grow from under the soil, not from the top. This helps many animals live in one place. When animals eat the grass, it grows back fast, so they always have food."

The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cold south. People call it the 'famous Ghan', but it is often late. A train line from Adelaide to Alice Springs was made in the 1920s, but it had problems with flooding. A new line was finished before my trip. The train is not very fast and is mostly for people on holiday. It is not as fancy as the Orient Express, but the food is very good. The railway was first made to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia through Darwin and the train would save time and money. The Ghan says it is the first train to go from north to south. When I waited to get on the Ghan, everyone was excited. Most of the people traveling with me were older Australians. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the train waited for four hours. Some people took a boat trip. I got off the train at Alice Springs and went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. We walked around the rock and watched the sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop here. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land and cattle.

It was February, my first big winter climb. We went up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters up - the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries'. These are like big bowls in the mountain, halfway up. We had tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need them because the snow is very hard, like ice. Even though some people in the group were very good climbers, we took safety things like lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, with no strong winds, but we were still a bit nervous. Ben Nevis in winter is always hard. The path went up and my legs felt tired. I was the slowest in the group, so I had to rest more. The others waited for me, but when I got to them, they started again. I told myself to train better next time. After 200 meters, we got to Tower Ridge. It is only one and a half meters wide, and the mountain goes down a long way on each side. We had to stay calm and watch every step. After seven hours, we got to the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometers away. But we were not lucky; there was mist. Going back down to camp is also hard. You need to read a map well. A wrong turn can be dangerous in winter. I was happy we took turns to read the map. That first time, I only felt happy when I was safe in the tent. But I made it to the top.'"

Hello, I'm Nathalie. Last year, I joined the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. I was one of the youngest foreign students. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. People asked me questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they spoke English, so we could talk. Now, after six months, everyone is nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers. 
When I first came, my mum stayed with me for two weeks. I was a bit sad when she left. One night, I called her because I felt lonely. The ballet classes here are harder than in England. I eat a lot to have energy. This helps me do well in school. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the film ends. Now, I feel happy here. I like walking in the city and going to shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10Â°C. The Russians said it was not very cold for that time of year! My room is warm and cosy.

The Arctic is very cold in winter. Not many people live there. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit made an art show in a snow building called an igloo. This was in a small town called Jukkasjarvi. Many people came to see it. Some people decided to sleep in the igloo. They liked it very much. This gave the idea to make an ice hotel. Now, the ICEHOTEL is famous.
Every winter, people come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They use snow and ice. The hotel opens in parts. The first part opens in December. The hotel is finished by January 7th. The hotel melts in spring when it gets warm.
Inside the hotel, it is not colder than -5Â°C to -8Â°C. Guests get warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves. It is good to bring sweaters, a scarf, and thick socks. You can buy these on the ICEHOTEL website. They will be in your room when you arrive.

PET_34,B1,"'Free-diving in the Caribbean Tanya Streeter is very good at free-diving. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean with just one breath. In 2003, Tanya Streeter went 120 meters deep into the ocean and came back up without help. She held her breath for over three and a half minutes. This made her the first woman to break a man's world record in any sport. Fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people think free-diving is dangerous, but Tanya says it is safe if you train well and focus on safety. Tanya trains a lot. She spends most of her time training in the gym. She also trains in the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. When she practices diving, she travels away from home. She does fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. Rest is important so she does not get tired. When Tanya is not diving, she talks to people about sports and helps with environmental projects. She grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman and loved swimming and exploring the sea. Tanya says her life now is like her childhood dreams. She is famous in some countries, so people listen to her about the environment. Tanya is in her thirties and wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and does not want to stop for many years.'"
PET_12,B1,"CARTOON FILMS
Cartoon films can show many things. If you can draw it, you can make it move in a movie. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons fun for everyone. In the 1970s, people thought cartoons were only for kids. But some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and kids can enjoy cartoons. Not all cartoon films were good. The Black Cauldron did not do well. It was too scary for kids and too simple for adults. Directors learned from this, and film companies started making money again."
PET_26,B1,"Title: Caroline Benson's First TV Role
Caroline Benson is a new TV star. She talks about her first TV role. 
Caroline is a student at university. She did not think she would act in a TV show in her first year. She only acted in school plays before. She loved a book called ""The Finnegans"" since she was eleven. Her grandmother said she was like a character in the book, Polly Finnegan. Caroline always wanted to play Polly.
Before university, Caroline traveled for a year. When she was in Chile, her mother sent her an email. The email said they wanted to make ""The Finnegans"" into a TV show. Caroline wanted to try for the role. Her mother sent her photo to the director. The director wanted to meet Caroline. She flew back home and got the role.
Caroline started filming one week after university began. She got permission to leave university for three weeks. When she came back, she woke up at 6:00 am to write her essays. She did not tell her university friends about the TV show, but they found out and were happy for her.
Caroline had a great time acting. She wants to be an actress after university. Her grandfather was an opera singer, but no one else in her family acts. She tried for other TV roles but did not get any yet. She also acted in two college plays. 
Caroline is going to Greece with friends for the summer. She is excited for the future."

I have learned a lot since we started. I wrote this book to share what I learned. I think we can run a good business and still keep our values. This book is not just about business or my life. The main idea is that to do well in business, you need to be different. Business can be fun, full of love, and do good things. In business and life, I want to have fun, feel like a family, and enjoy surprises. I want people who work at 'The Body Shop' to feel the same. This book shares my ideas with everyone. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' and what we can do. I find this exciting, and I hope you do too.'"

There are more than 300 types of honey. Light honey is usually less strong in taste than dark honey. Long ago, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians used honey as money. Today, people make and eat honey everywhere in the world. Honey can help with tiredness and make you better at sports. Honey is not just food; it can help sore throats and is used in skin and hair products."
PET_7,B1,"Norwich Norwich is a city in East Anglia, a part of Britain. People have lived there for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, it was one of the biggest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, so it is important for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095. Norwich became a city in 1194, which means it could make its own rules. Today, Norwich is smaller than London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second biggest city in England. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs. In 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many things to do, like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centers. Norwich also has a football team called 'The Canaries', and their colors are green and yellow. There is a new shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. It took over two years to build, and now it has a park on the roof with water pools and trees. The old market is still in the city center, next to the new shopping center. Both places are popular, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new things."
PET_43,B1,"'The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every year in autumn, the sky in Albuquerque, a city in the south-west of the United States, is full of bright colors. This is because of the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. It is a big event that lasts nine days. The first festival was in 1972 for a radio station's 50th birthday. There were only a few balloons then. Now, there are about a thousand balloons from many countries. What to see The balloon pilots talk to each other on the radio. They light up their balloons at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow.' You can take great photos. You need to come at night or early in the morning to see this. During the day, you can walk around and talk to the pilots. The balloons are different sizes and colors. Some look like animals or cartoon characters. Kids will like it. In the afternoon, you can go on a balloon ride over the desert. You can also take a cable car to the top of the mountains and see the festival from above. There are many fun things to do, like balloon races and fireworks. The Albuquerque Box This is a special wind pattern that helps balloons fly well. The Sandia Mountains keep the balloons safe from strong winds. Pilots can move their balloons by going up or down. Practical advice Buy your tickets online before you go. Wear layers of clothes because it is cool at night and warm during the day. Bring sunglasses and suncream. Bring a flashlight for night events and a camera for pictures. If you use film, bring high-speed film for night photos.'"

They look like something from a science-fiction movie. Inside each biosphere, there is a different climate. This shows how important plants are to people. Many things we use every day come from plants, like wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. There are over 135,000 different plants here. Even if it is cold outside, heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall.

Most of the book is stories. There are stories by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Some writers who are not very famous write about food. Be careful with Jane Harris's story, Those Nails. Do not read it after eating because it has some scenes that are not nice. There are also poems by nineteen poets, like R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are parts of new novels by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. There is a little non-fiction too, like a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about newspapers and a special piece by Ursula Owen about herself.

PET_14,B1,"""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. Margaret lives in London. She likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but sometimes she teaches five-year-olds too. She started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first students were her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students. Each lesson is one hour long and happens every two weeks. Each student also has one lesson alone with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons. At first, students learn to play by listening. They do not read music until they have played for many years. There is a big difference between their playing and reading music for a long time. Margaret says her way is not to make great violinists. She suggests that very good students should leave and learn the violin in a different way."

Tom Wilcott plays bass guitar now. He replaced Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer. The first song on the CD is a dance song. The band is not only playing slow songs now. The second song is also a dance song. It is louder and heavier. Most of the other songs are slow, like before. These two dance songs might surprise fans. They are very good and could become popular. The singer, Rob Letchford, sings very well on this CD. He recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. People who bought tickets do not need to worry. The concerts will happen later when Rob is better. On this CD, Moonshine shows they can play different kinds of music. Some songs are slow, and some are fast. I think the best songs are at the beginning. The last songs are not as good. But 'Here Again' will still be a big success for the band."

San Francisco is a city in northern California, near the ocean. The first European to find this place was a Spanish man named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it in 1769. San Francisco Bay is a great place for ships, but it was found by people walking, not by ships.
In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to look for gold. But the people who got rich were not the ones looking for gold. The richest people owned banks and law offices. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.
Today, many tourists visit San Francisco. They like to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some people also take a short boat ride to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

Today, we still use leather, but also silk, plastic, and cotton, depending on what is popular. About 150 years ago, people started wearing different shoes on each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could fit on either foot. All shoes were made by hand, but now most shoes are made by machines in big factories.

They said there were not many women running, so they did not make special changing rooms for them. I made posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. They wanted to lose weight, but they did not think much about running before. They thought running was hard and painful. They did not think about running and talking with friends in nice places, like near a river. At first, they ran for one minute. Now, they can run for thirty minutes. They also learned about food and staying fit from other runners. I wanted to help women run, and I am very happy to see them get better. They are happy too.'"
PET_40,B1,"**The History of the Iditarod - The Last Great Race on Earth**
In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the most northern state in the USA. Many people went there to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod became the biggest city in Alaska for a short time.
In summer, boats could bring things to these towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, so boats could not come. In 1910, a winter path was made for dogs to pull sleds. The dogs took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for the dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at places called 'roadhouses' to rest and eat.
The trail was used every winter until the 1920s. Then, airplanes started to be used instead of dog teams. But in 1925, a disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was far away in Anchorage. Airplanes were new, and people were not sure if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot was not there, so they used dog teams to bring the medicine.
The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, from Norway, traveled the first 400 kilometers. His dog Togo helped him find the way in the snow. The last part was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Balto. Balto saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped, and Balto became a hero.
Today, there is a dog sled race every year from Anchorage to Nome. It follows the 1925 journey and is called the Iditarod, known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on a boys' team in Mozambique. Her team won a local competition. At first, no one minded that Maria was a girl, but the team they beat complained. A local newspaper wrote about Maria. Jose Craveirinha, who helped African athletes, read the story. He went to see Maria and saw her playing football. He noticed she was very fast. Jose talked to Maria about running. Maria only knew about football. Jose bought her running shoes and took her to train. It was hard work, and her legs hurt. Jose talked to Maria's parents and said she could be successful and help her family. They agreed to let her train with him.
In 1991, Maria went to the United States to train. She did not want to go before because she would miss her family. In the US, Maria met other girls who were athletes. They were different from her. Maria worried about her family having enough food, but the other girls worried about clothes and make-up. They did not know much about Maria or her life. Maria felt lucky to be there. The trainers were very good, and she learned a lot.

Adults are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher says pop music is too easy for people who love music. I like jazz because it is new and old.

Flora is twelve years old. She has trouble cutting onions. She says, 'I love cooking. I cooked for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum said I should have a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I didn't want to go at first. But now, I'm glad I came.'

PET_5,B1,"'Winter Driving Winter can be dangerous for driving. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be on top of a hill. Ice can be under the snow and make you slide off the road. A car coming towards you can slide too. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Do not make sudden movements. When you turn the wheel, use the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you do not spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention. Look far down the road if there is ice. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. When the road is wet, allow double the normal stopping distance. On snow, allow three times the distance. On ice, allow even more. Try to stay in control of your car, and you will be safe.'"
PET_41,B1,"Craigie Aitchison
Craigie Aitchison was a painter. He was born in Scotland. He went to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. He found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art in Italy. He liked early Italian artists. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the clear light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colors from light to dark, but he says he never knows what the painting will look like in the end. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself.' He does not plan the colors before he starts. Aitchison says anyone can use colors because you can buy them. He just notices what colors look good next to each other. He does not draw before he paints because he might get bored and not finish the painting. He changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes models who do not ask to see the painting while he is working. If they want to look, he cannot paint. Aitchison moved to London a long time ago. He does not feel part of the Scottish painting scene. He does not follow any tradition. He just paints the way he can. But his work still influences young British painters."

'Okay,' we said, 'but be careful with the noise for the family and neighbors.' That was just the start. Drums are hard to move, so Ben's band friends came to our house with their guitars and other things. For a few hours each week, the house is loud with their music and singing. But Ben's hobby is good for us: when the band plays, my husband and I go for a long walk. The music sounds different, but the boys are nice and polite. I don't know if they are good at music, but they play in local clubs for young people. We worry they might not study enough because of the band, but this hasn't happened yet.

PET_47,B1,"'Being an older student I am 32 years old and I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes and learn to read books fast and write long papers. I went back to school after 14 years. Before, I worked as a secretary. I made good money, but I was bored. I wanted to think more. I saw students at the local university. They looked happy and hopeful. I wanted to be like them. Now, I am a student, but it is hard to make friends with younger students. They think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because they know more than me. But I am happy to study because I want a good job. I like reading on weekends more than going to parties. I also enjoy student discounts for movies and theater. I sometimes worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good idea.'"

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was 15 years old, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cheap cars for people. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T'. It cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap. But they did not have many choices. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

Five years ago, Jenny made sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at markets, but it was summer and too hot. People did not want sweaters. So, she made socks instead. People loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started. 
At first, Jenny made socks at home. But soon, many people wanted to buy them. So, she sent the wool to a factory. Now, machines make the socks. There are six colors, five sizes, and different socks for walking, sports, and skiing.

KET_10,A2,"'BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON Most house break-ins happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that house break-ins have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of break-ins happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. He said that night-time break-ins are rare because families are usually at home then. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also, many houses are empty at that time because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.''"

KET_44,A2,"'The History of Farming Before farming, people went to the forest to find plants or fruit to eat. They moved a lot to find food. About 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow food. These were the first farmers. Farming let people stay in one place, and their villages got bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers grew food for everyone. But farming was hard when the weather was bad, and some people did not have enough food. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels very far to our homes.'"

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will find Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake is covered with ice. Many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. They sit inside to catch fish under the ice.
Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then, you put the line through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I like to have some chocolate or another snack! Today I caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"""

We asked her what is important when learning snowboarding. She said, ""You can learn fast, but you need lessons. It is also important to have the right clothes so you do not get wet because you fall down a lot at first!"""

KET_64,A2,"Mount Kilimanjaro
Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different ways to go up. People say the Marangu path is the easiest. It is five kilometers long. It takes about five days to climb and many tourists like it. Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and wet. But at the top, there is ice and snow, and it can be very cold, below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,A2,"'Otters Not many people have seen an otter. Otters are animals that live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. Otters usually come out at night. They are very good at swimming and can swim more than 10 kilometers an hour. Otters have thick brown hair to keep them warm in the water. They can close their ears and nose, so they can stay under water for a few minutes. Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were dirty, and many fish and insects died. The otters had no food. But now, the rivers are clean, and there is lots of food for otters.'"

KET_59,A2,"'Buildings People make buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We use museums to keep beautiful things. Many people work on a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers build it. The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a nice roof. It is beautiful from every side. The Olympic Stadium in Munich also has a famous roof. It looks like a glass tent.'"

KET_61,A2,"'Gail Rollins Gail Rollins is a very good runner from Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run in the 10,000 meters and maybe the 5,000 meters at the European Championships. Before, Gail often came second in big races. But she was always happy and smiling, and people in her city like her for this. In 2004, she ran her first half-marathon, a long road race, and she won. It was the fastest time of the year for a British woman. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also ran when he was younger. But he stopped because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes runs with Gail. But it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him. Gail trains hard. She runs long in the morning and fast in the afternoon. But she rests on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, ""Are you sure you should eat that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.'"

KET_28,A2,"'Bill Prince-Smith Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he started writing children's books at 60 years old. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live close, but they also read my stories and say if they are good or bad.' This helps Bill know what young children like to read. Bill writes about life in his village and the farms nearby. His fifth book is his favorite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and his dog. 'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are very smart, they learn fast.' Last year, the book became a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used new computer technology to make it look like the animals are talking. Bill was very happy with the film. 'Sometimes film-makers change books, but they didn't change mine and I love the film.''"
KET_35,A2,"'POSTCARDS Today, people like to send postcards to friends and family. Postcards have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday. Postcards are cheap, and the pictures are often better than their own photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed pictures of news events, like an accident or an important person's visit. People liked these because newspapers did not have pictures then.'"
KET_5,A2,"'Dinosaurs No one has ever seen a dinosaur. Dinosaurs lived a long time ago, about 60 million years before people. We do not know why they all died. Birds are the closest animals to dinosaurs today. Dinosaurs looked different from each other. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some dinosaurs were small, but some were very big. The biggest dinosaurs were the largest animals on land. The Brontosaurus was a big dinosaur. It was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth to eat meat and could run fast with its long back legs.'"

There are seven kinds of bears. The biggest bear is the white polar bear. It is almost three meters tall. There are two kinds of black bears. One kind lives in North America, and the other kind lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black. They can be dark brown or reddish brown. Many people love the black and white panda bear from China. There are not many pandas in the forest now because it is hard for them to find food.'"

KET_17,A2,"'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon to carry people in the air. In 1903, the Wright brothers made the first plane with an engine and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, planes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour. The trip from London to New York takes only four hours. Today, many people travel by plane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,A2,"'The Globe Theatre Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people got cold and wet if it rained. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to watch plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. People ate, talked, walked around during the show, and sometimes threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place near the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"
KET_48,A2,"Dear Jeff,
I am having a nice holiday in Australia. We came here two weeks ago. At first, the weather was bad and cold. Now, the weather is nice, and we go to the beach every day. This week, we are in Sydney. Next week, we went to the Great Barrier Reef. The water was warm, and I loved swimming. The fish are different colors: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We do not want to go home!
See you at the end of September.
