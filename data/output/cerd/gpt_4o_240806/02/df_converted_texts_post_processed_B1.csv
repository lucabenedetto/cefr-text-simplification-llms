CPE_15,C2,"Title: Charging for Rubbish: Does It Work?
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and economy. But it might not be. In many developed countries, rubbish collection is a common service. Rubbish bags are collected by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Usually, this service is paid for through local taxes, so families that produce a lot of rubbish pay the same as those that produce little. However, more rubbish means more trucks and workers are needed, which costs more money.
Economists think that if rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much. A solution could be to charge families for the amount of rubbish they produce. This might encourage them to throw away less and recycle more. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this idea has complicated results.
They studied several American towns that started charging for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers that people put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with stickers are collected. In Charlottesville, Virginia, people were charged 80 cents per bag. The number of bags collected dropped by 37%, but people just packed more rubbish into each bag. The weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In other towns without charges, the weight fell by 3.5% anyway. Some people even dumped rubbish illegally to avoid paying.
One good result was a 15% increase in recycling, but this might not be because of the fee, as many people were already recycling. In another study, the economists found that higher sticker prices only slightly reduced rubbish weight. A 10% price increase cut rubbish by just 0.3%. This is because people would need to buy less of everything to reduce rubbish a lot.
So, should we stop charging for rubbish? Not necessarily. Free disposal is too cheap, but simple policies can have complex effects. Sometimes, we need detailed economic studies to understand these effects."
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Just having a successful career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their jobs are not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. Does it help your mind, character, and relationships? This is important. No matter how good you are at your job, if it makes you boring or too busy to learn new things or be creative, then money and status won't make up for it.
Zeldin wants to find out how work can help us grow as people, not just be a way to make money. Work should be a part of a good life, helping us find new talents and meet different people. But this doesn't mean getting rid of unemployment is the only goal. As people get more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and useful. Work should be like a piece of art, with a happy person at the center.
Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and accountants, have problems now. Doctors are stressed, and accountants worry about ethics. Architects can't always be creative, and managers feel stuck. Companies are getting smaller, and new ideas like giving more decision power to employees haven't worked well. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company's values.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He looks at what makes people happy and respected. He wants to find better ways for people to work. Many experts focus on making companies last longer and earn more money, but we also need to think about what kind of people we want to be and who we want to work with.
For example, hotel workers often have a lot of potential but work long hours for low pay. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and learn from each other. But accountants often say hotels should focus only on making money.
Zeldin believes work is about relationships. People want jobs where they can be independent and choose their colleagues and customers. This means they need to talk to people from different backgrounds and understand each other. Good communication is important, but real conversation is even more valuable. It helps people connect and understand each other better, changing the world a little bit each time."
CPE_24,C2,"**Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand over a large area. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents the hope of modern times. It suggests planned growth and a good outcome if conditions are right. Broadcasting assumes there is a central source, like a bucket of seeds, that spreads information widely.
The question is why a new technology that could send words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, is a form of communication. But from the start, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. Sending broadcasts from a central place to homes matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of organising television were tried but did not last.
Two interesting alternatives show what television could have been in a different society. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television, like a video phone. Magazines like Radio News explained how to build TV transmitters and receivers. However, in 1938, big companies set standards that pushed these small-scale efforts aside. This ended the chance for television to become a more equal and community-based form of communication.
Broadcasting was linked to strong economic interests and the structure of modern societies. In the USA in the early 1930s, television was mainly for public shows and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In Britain and Germany, people mostly watched TV in public places. The idea of community-based TV was not strong, but public viewing was common in several countries in the 1930s.
Manufacturers saw the potential for selling TVs to homes once prices dropped. As working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s, the dream of a home full of entertainment became possible for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening worldwide.
There is a link between social modernisation and broadcasting. As societies became more centralised, traditional communities broke up, leading to new ways of life. People moved more, both socially and geographically, becoming more isolated. Centralised broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of national community.
Broadcasting became the main way to organise radio and television. It also played a role in democracy by providing equal access to information needed for political and social participation. However, television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become outdated. If that happens, the idea of broadcasting will be seen as a part of a specific time in social modernisation."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It's normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes wanting more things can get out of control. Modern advertising is made to make us feel insecure. It often tells us that if we don't have certain things, we are not good enough. To see how much you are influenced, try not to read any advertising signs next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages try to convince us to buy things without us even noticing. We see them everywhere - on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, the internet - all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research centers and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, especially how they were formed, their water systems, and their living organisms. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature, which makes us curious and eager to learn more about them. Because they are natural wonders, caves have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they affect our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many people who watched the weather without any tools helped start the science of meteorology, which has become very advanced since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools give us weather information quickly, and computers solve complex math problems faster than humans can. Meteorology uses many difficult words that are hard for non-experts to understand. But simple weather knowledge is still important. Human experience is key to turning computer data into weather forecasts. Observations from people can still provide important information to help professionals understand the weather."
CPE_16,C2,"**Music and Theatre**
Until recently, I thought opera was mainly about theatre. But after working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This makes sense, but I come from the theatre world, where the words and the actors are the focus. In theatre, once the show starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.
At musical performances, like concerts or operas, many people, including me, might not understand music technically. Some might feel embarrassed about this, but most are amazed by the performers' skills. A great singer or a perfect orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match. We know athletes do something similar to us running for a bus, but they do it much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often don't understand an actor's skill and aren't as impressed by something that seems like what they could do. They don't usually applaud when an actor finishes a long speech, though they often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This doesn't mean theatre audiences are more or less demanding than music audiences. Many people go to both. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how challenging the play is.
Does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I think yes. Music performances are full of emotion and can be unpredictable, reaching the listener's imagination. But music events often feel formal, with strict dress codes and a focus on conductors and soloists. This can make the difference between performers and listeners feel too big. On the other hand, when audiences clap between movements or after a great performance, it can interrupt the flow of the music.
Can anything be done? Yes, a lot is being done. There are efforts to bring new audiences to concerts and operas and to make serious music feel more accessible. I remember a special event, Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a high-quality musical experience and life-changing for many in the audience, who also took part in the performance.
I wish music had more of the risk and excitement that theatre can have. Sometimes this comes from using unusual locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. It might be uncomfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists into unexpected places. Most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. But I believe music events can change. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**
I admire how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete. However, I don't like sand in its natural form. For me, it is a difficult barrier between the car park and the sea. Sand blows in your face, gets into your food, and hides important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong water spray. But, strangely, when you step onto a towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, sand falls off you. For days, you find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. I prefer to avoid sand.
**Lock and Key**
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security. In the past, people used a beam behind the door, but now we have electronic locks with many combinations. The need to keep out bad people is still strong. Locks and keys are comforting. Some companies tried using computer locks with smart cards, but people didn't like them. At work, it might be okay, but at home, people want to use a real key. So, when a locksmith company made a new electronic lock, they included a real metal key.
**Modern Art**
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because I don't understand modern art well. I like some of it, like furry things, neon lights, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more, I would have more opinions. But art is not about writing essays; it's about letting it speak to you. This idea sounds good, but it never worked for me. However, this new gallery helps visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed were the labels. They explain the art and what it means. These labels helped me understand the art instead of just staring at it."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
When books are turned into movies, a lot of the story is cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also be interesting. When I worked on a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still keep the main idea. This doesn't mean the original book had unnecessary parts. It's about how each type of storytelling, like books or movies, needs different things. In books, certain details, like character traits or who is speaking, are repeated to help the reader understand. In plays, which are mostly dialogue, the way people talk can be very realistic or very stylized. Sometimes, the dialogue is so full of extra words that it's hard to know what's really being said.
**Watching Movies**
When you watch a movie, you can feel like you're part of the story. It's like being in a different world where real life doesn't matter for a while. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, you're back in the real world. Some people used to think movies were just for fun and not real art. They liked watching them but didn't see them as important.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a mix of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were no clear signs or main entrance. There were three main entrances, but only one led to where you wanted to go. Visitors were rare because the studio didn't want them. But the people who worked there knew their way around. Together, they made movies that brought excitement and adventure to people, helping them escape from everyday problems for a few hours.
**Film-makers**
Many people dream of making movies. There are many books and courses on how to write scripts and make films. Some competitions even give away cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his first film, El Mariachi, which cost only $7,000. This film made him famous quickly. In the past, filmmakers took longer to become successful. They started by working in different jobs like editing or writing. They learned by making small films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann became successful in his forties. Today, without the support of big studios, new filmmakers have to be more independent."
CPE_3,C2,"In those days, the council houses covered the western side of the city. They were rows of small, dull houses made of orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory, two miles away, would fill the air with a strong smell of sulfur. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose as he walked up to deliver newspapers.
I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. I also remember faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the big mansion at Earlham.
My mother was a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn't make her happy. Even as a child, when I went with her to the shops in Bunnett Square or into the city, I noticed her unusual personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, alone even in a room full of people. She was very strict about behaving properly, which was not common in West Earlham. This meant not walking into neighbors' gardens, sitting quietly in the dining room listening to the radio, and many other rules.
Despite her loneliness, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier but not fully accepted by the others. They often talked about their problems, like bad legs and ungrateful children, and I often felt included in that last category.
Growing up in West Earlham followed a routine. Until you were five, you stayed at home. Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school. Some children had mothers with bikes to take them, but my mother let me go with other children from the street.
If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays. During these times, I saw glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy, and once, I went to a charity event where a woman tried to interest me in the League of Pity, a junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying they just wanted money.
My mother often talked about money and didn't trust politicians. She thought of them as greedy people taking money from the public. I might be exaggerating, but my mother didn't show much kindness. However, she did care about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she would take me to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would look at paintings, and she would sometimes make comments. I remember her joking about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying, ""Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd-numbered houses. It was getting dark, and the air was thick and wet, making my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well since I was a child. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. My first friends, who were all girls, lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses. Even if I didn't know everyone by name, each house was special to me, like the little rain channels in the sidewalk that I used to skate over. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed a bit less fancy, with lower porches and smaller front yards. Over time, things changed: wooden porch parts were replaced with iron ones, in a style that seemed Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops.
**Bachelor Fads**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has typical loft features like exposed brick and big doors. But Gilbert didn't want an open space because it was hard to separate work from home life. So, he used a big plastic sheet to create a hallway and hide his office. This also led the eye to the kitchen, which he wanted to be a neutral area for both cooking for friends and making coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and steel, he used light wood for the floors. His flat has both modern furniture and sentimental pieces from his parents or markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer known for his adventurous life and mysterious stories. His first book, ""In Patagonia,"" published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was exciting like a thriller and imaginative like a novel. Chatwin often mixed facts with fiction to make his stories more interesting. He believed that through travel, one could discover fascinating histories.
**Swimming**
One summer, during a heavy rain, I swam in the pool behind my house. The rain made bubbles on the water, and the storm was so loud it drowned out the birds. It was then, in 1996, that I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in a pool. Many places today are labeled and explained, but activities like walking, cycling, and swimming let us explore the wild and mysterious parts of the world. A swimming journey would help me connect with nature, like dark woods or high mountains, which still hold mystery."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING Charles Darwin thought that humans cry for no clear reason. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said crying helps mothers and children bond. Many people think that tears, especially in children, show helplessness. But why adults cry is harder to understand. The sound of crying is less important than the way it looks. In early human groups, crying might have helped build trust and social connections. Tears can also happen for other reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or speeches. We might cry during a sad movie, and this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. Crying clearly has a social role, but scientists are still studying it.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it change our lives? Many people have an idea of what global warming is, but not everyone knows what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, changes in climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are important.
The problem is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. In the last 100 years, human activities have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere. These gases are linked to global temperature. It seems that these gases, which will continue to increase, are already affecting the climate. However, we do not fully understand the global heat balance, making the future uncertain.
We know that greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together over the past 40,000 years. This suggests they are related. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly due to human pollution.
A lot of research uses computer models to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. These models use physics and chemistry to study temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climate factors. However, they are not perfect and can be slow and costly to use. We do not fully understand all climate processes, but we know they are complex.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. Predictions suggest that by 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Extreme weather like heatwaves, floods, and droughts may become more common.
Climate change can affect where plants and animals live, the mix of species, and their ability to provide benefits to humans. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and harmful, but not all. Some impacts might be beneficial. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have increased wheat yields since 1952.
However, many predicted effects of future warming are not good. Small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry areas or places with existing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where rainfall patterns have changed. Rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter in southern Portugal.
Another effect is changes to glaciers, which will impact ice and affect vegetation, wildlife, and human structures. The Arctic ice might melt completely, making it easier for marine transport and oil exploration but increasing iceberg dangers.
The most dramatic effect of global warming could be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and ice melts. With half of the world's population living near coasts, rising sea levels could cause severe problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo might face flooding. Many people could lose their homes, creating environmental refugees. Small island countries could disappear if the worst happens, affecting their people and culture and the countries that would need to help them."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars and back. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This is the type of people needed for the first trip to Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to send a spacecraft on 5 January 2018 happen. The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars's gravity to come back to Earth without using more fuel, because saving fuel is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next chance to launch when Mars and Earth are in the right position is not until 2031. It is a big challenge, but the goal is to create new technologies. If these can be ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it doesn't launch, the work to reach these goals will help future space missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**Aesthetics**
Sometimes, the way we think about art makes it hard to understand it. Artworks like buildings, books, paintings, or statues are often seen as just physical objects. But real art is about what these objects do to our experiences. This misunderstanding can make it difficult to truly appreciate art.
Some artworks are so admired that they become ""classics."" When this happens, they can seem separate from the human experiences that created them and the effects they have on our lives. This separation makes it hard to see their true meaning.
Art is often put in a special category, away from other human activities. This makes it difficult to connect art with everyday life. People who study art need to show how art is connected to daily experiences, just like geographers and geologists explain how mountains are part of the earth.
To understand art, we sometimes need to look away from the artworks themselves and focus on everyday experiences. Just like understanding plants requires knowing about soil, air, water, and sunlight, understanding art requires looking at the basic experiences that catch our attention and bring us joy.
Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips without thinking of them as art. This is because art is often seen as something only found in museums and galleries. But real art is also in the enjoyable experiences we find in our daily lives.
When art is connected to everyday life, people appreciate it more. However, many people still think of art as something separate from ordinary experiences, which can limit their understanding and enjoyment of it."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
People often imagine lions hunting as a perfect team. In the evening light, a group of lions quietly moves and surrounds their prey, like skilled hunters. Lions seem to be very social animals, working together for a common goal, which is to catch their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. When we started our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, take care of their cubs, and scare away rivals with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many of its offspring survive, then working together might not always be the best choice. If an animal is too helpful, others might benefit more than it does. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. Like the noble gases krypton, argon, and neon, lions are often inactive. It has taken many research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand them.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a big moment for the band. ""New Life"" started a new trend in rock music in the country for the rest of the decade. The old style of serious music with loud guitars was replaced by a lighter, more melodic sound. The album mixed social themes with fun sounds like fairground organs and brass bands. It was full of humor and irony, and the singers didn't hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were good at collecting different styles and writing songs. They sang about typical English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength was in its deeper, more emotional songs like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink."" ""New Life"" is a beautiful album with 16 high-quality tracks and no unnecessary songs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was fascinated by stories of ""The Sibyl,"" wise women from ancient times. I first heard about them in a story my mother told me. An old woman offered nine books to the King of Rome for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three books and offered the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I learned a lesson about sales and life from this story. As a lonely child, I often asked to play with others but was refused. My mother advised me to do something interesting so others would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something meaningful to me. I'm not a big traveler, so I sent my editor a list of places I didn't want to visit. I'm interested in ruins because I like to travel through time in my mind.
**What Becomes of Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it usually goes into a pile waiting to be sorted. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" The person sorting it is often a young editorial assistant or an experienced part-time worker. They don't have much power, but they want to find something original. The young assistant hopes to make a name for themselves, and the experienced worker wants to keep their job. If they like your novel, they will pass it to a senior editor. At an acquisition meeting, the editor must explain why your novel is good and if it can sell well. They also consider if you, as an author, have a future and if you can be promoted easily. Publishers often want to meet a new author before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising Challenges in the Early 1990s**
If you worked in advertising during the early 1990s, it was likely a very tough time. The economy was in a recession, which was worse than expected. In Britain, for example, the economy shrank, interest rates were high, people spent less money, many lost their jobs, and thousands of homes were taken back by banks. Every business felt the impact, especially car and building companies, which saw a big drop in sales.
People in advertising were not the only ones losing jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They had to work harder with less money. Despite these challenges, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on making products that customers wanted, not just what was easy to produce. This change helped marketing gain more respect, but it also added more responsibility.
Marketing was seen as a solution to many problems, and since a lot of marketing money was spent on advertising, advertisers felt the pressure. The 1980s were good for advertising, but the 1990s started with a big downturn. This was partly due to the economy, but also because companies began to question the value of advertising. They wanted to know exactly what they were getting for their money.
Companies wanted better strategies and creativity from advertising agencies. They wanted the best people working hard to create great ads. This meant that people in advertising had to do more with less money, just like their clients.
Other challenges made advertising difficult, such as changes in population, stronger retailers, changing consumer needs, more legal rules, and the need to advertise in other countries. These issues made advertisers think about how to make more of their ads effective.
Finding help to improve advertising was not easy. Companies and agencies were busy dealing with these problems and did not share their successful strategies. Conferences and seminars offered some help, but books on advertising were not very useful. They often made advertising seem more perfect than it really was, which did not help those responsible for creating ads."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular job. Chefs have tough lives: they work long hours, face a lot of pressure, do simple tasks, and earn little money. But these things didn't stop me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life was closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape. It offered seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life. My wish to cook was not just because I was a student. It also showed my love for beauty. I first saw this beauty when I ate at a famous London restaurant. It was amazing. I still remember my starter. After that meal, I wanted to thank the chef who made it. I felt happy for days. After this, I wanted to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I changed my student life to prepare for my future in cooking. My history degree felt empty and distracted me from my real goal. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making fancy meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming teacher was a former drill sergeant, small and strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pool's edge, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes!' The next week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed, and its front edge bent slightly down. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to be brave. Slowly, the sounds around me faded, and I felt like I was in silence. I moved my arms as I was taught, tried to look up, not down, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs went everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he couldn't take away my happiness. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who like a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveler is both confusing and interesting. These are people who choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone in small boats through big waves, eating insects if there's nothing else, and living for months in the unknown. It's easy to think of these people as strange, like hermits or writers. They exist, but their world is far from our everyday life. We can ignore them and return to our world of microwaves and phones, happy that our biggest risks are crossing busy streets.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He doesn't say he's a top sailor, but he is a good one. He sails because, as a writer, he likes to write about it. Sailing gives him stories of danger and success to write about. Raban's boat has a device that tells sailors their exact position anywhere on Earth. He likes this tool, but he also has a simple view of other sailing aids. He thinks the compass was a bad invention because it changed how people connect with the sea. Since it was invented, sailors look at the compass instead of the waves and the sea. The ocean, once full of life, is now just a space. Because the sailor's job is just to stay on course, an autopilot can replace him for long times. This might be why Raban had time to watch the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our experiences to those in books, even if they were written long ago or far away. There are fewer types of people than there are people themselves. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can describe situations we thought were unique to us, or express our thoughts clearly. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly written in books, even if the author lived in a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves. Reading and traveling help us escape our daily routines. Our eyes are most open when we are in a new place or reading a great book. Books help us notice things we ignored before. We become more aware of the sky, people's faces, a friend's behavior, or a hidden sadness we didn't know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes where the editor cut parts to fit the page. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were important. I could have made more changes, but that would never end. For example, in an article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed the article to predict this, it wouldn't be a true report from that time. Like any traveler, I was there at that moment, not knowing what would happen next, and trying to understand what had already happened. This is the real story of mass travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. I believe that even a simple postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that are overused, ""ecotourism"" would win. The term started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that travelers wanted to believe their trips wouldn't harm the environment. ""Ecotourism"" became a popular marketing term. Now, it includes anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour with cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or adventure is called ecotourism. The original idea was to help people make informed choices, but without clear rules, many travelers are confused about what ecotourism really means.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again by luck. It helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn't perfect. In Transylvania, I had an easier time than expected, staying in friendly country houses for weeks. When I stopped traveling, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again, and sometimes I only wrote short notes. When I began writing this book, I worried that some details might be out of order. But then I realized this book is not a guidebook, so I let the story tell itself without worrying too much."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, linked to the growth of business in the 1800s and 1900s. However, many fashion historians say that fashion, in terms of style and design, has been around for a long time. They often start with the 1500s and 1600s when trade and markets began to grow. As societies became more complex and populations grew, new ways to make different types of clothing and accessories were discovered. This made the meanings of clothing more complex and important. Today, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit, which seems very standard, can mean different things in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Stories about publishers fighting over new books give a wrong idea of what life is like for most writers. For those of us not on the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smart ones write in the evenings and have full-time jobs that are secure even if their book doesn't become a hit. Others, like me, do various small jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles. I've heard about a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I've never gotten anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often with help from friends, the novel gets written.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places we were performing at around the country started to sell out, and extra security was needed to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to the venues to avoid being surrounded by fans. On the few nights we weren't working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management and others took care of all our needs. Even though I was always shy, I felt a strange new confidence that only shy people in similar situations might understand. In short, I was emotionally overwhelmed."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Challenges**
Technology is changing how we live, work, and enjoy our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, we had more ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there were fewer live music performances and jobs for musicians. More people can now listen to music, which is important for many reasons. Music is part of big national events and personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn instruments.
I believe people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills early on. Research in the USA shows that music can improve spatial reasoning, a part of intelligence. In Europe, group music lessons help with social skills and concentration in children. Playing an instrument might also help develop skills like good study habits and organization.
In the short term, there will still be a need for music lessons. In the long term, music might change in two ways. First, people will listen to more types of music, mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music, making it easier for people to compose without needing technical skills. This might mean fewer live performances. More people of all ages might want to make music in their communities, reflecting their local traditions.
To prepare for this future, music teaching needs to change. More people should be able to learn different instruments throughout their lives. The way we teach and measure progress in music will need to adapt to include more skills. Musicians will need to inspire and teach people of all ages, work with large groups, and have skills in communication, social interaction, and management. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require showing the quality of music education.
Finally, we need to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is crucial, but often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes people make fun of actors or don't respect them. This often happens because actors talk about their work in interviews, and it can sound silly or like gossip. A famous dancer, Pavlova, once said that if she could explain her dance, she wouldn't need to dance it. Actors should remember this. Paul Scofield, a well-known actor, said that acting is only interesting when it's being done. Talking about it makes it seem less real. Each play is new for an actor, and they learn from the characters and the writer. When a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next one starts. This emptiness is why talking about acting can feel pointless.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man between being a boy and an adult. His performance is simple but very strong. He understands the text well and controls his body and mind, making him a top actor. Lester's Hamlet is a nervous and quick-tempered young man, full of hidden anger. He is smart and funny, making him both scary and lovable. Even though he doesn't show off, his skill is clear. Watch how he moves; his body seems ready to come alive. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a similar way, as if moved by an inner force. This makes us wonder: What is acting? Is it copying real life or creating something new? Who controls these actors, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director starts rehearsals with a method called 'dropping in'. The stage manager shows the script on a screen. Actors sit quietly and listen to others speak, thinking about the words. When it's their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, think about its meaning, and then speak. For example, if the line is, 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?', they breathe and let the thought come to them. They might imagine waiting in line for a bus or a concert. They find the reason to say the line, which the director calls 'The pathway to the line'. This can come from looking at the other actor or thinking about their character's situation. The director says not to plan too much and to trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel like your presence matters. Going to a live performance is special, and the staff should feel this too. It's not good if it seems like just another job for them. The theatre should connect the performer and the audience. Everyone should be able to see and hear well and feel involved. The size of the theatre is important. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it doesn't work well because drama is about people. Many theatres from the late 1800s got this right. They made spaces that feel welcoming. I like theatres with a sense of history, like old stone steps in a church. You can't please everyone with a play. You can't guess what the audience will want. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising, something you couldn't imagine at home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mostly popular with young people. However, it also had a big effect on older people and the middle class. It helped create new rock stars who were inspired by this exciting new music. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this music was on Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very important for many future rock stars. Just like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg to hear rock and roll, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He was ready to move from just listening to music to making his own.
**Snow Adventure**
There was no clear path, but I thought I would be safe if I walked carefully. The wind was strong and pushed me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I fell through a thin layer. I climbed out, feeling scared and thinking about what I would do if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. It was clear I needed to change my plan.
**Understanding Qualitative Research**
There are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. These books often talk about how to collect data but not much about how to analyze it. Many people find data analysis mysterious. So, we asked different social scientists to talk about how they analyze their data. The goal was to share ideas and understanding about data analysis, not to create a guidebook. This means making hidden methods more clear. While this seems easy, it is actually quite difficult. We let our contributors share their work in different styles, like personal stories or more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show he watched recently. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn't remember much. Many people are excited about using the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son was more interested in playing with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as shown by my son and his noodles, is a medium that gives impressions and suggestions. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach children is fine, but formal education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people didn't like it at first because they thought these newcomers were ruining their area of Los Angeles. But eventually, they accepted it because Hollywood was successful. Success in Hollywood means making a lot of money at the box office. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: a film that might make someone a star, but will definitely make money. In less than 100 years, Hollywood grew from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot: a century ago, you could walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it is still like a village with limited views, just a small part of Los Angeles. For people living and working there, the main topic is films: how much money they made, who is dating whom, who has been betrayed, and who is working on which project. Successful people often try to leave: they work there but live somewhere else. Still, it is the place where almost everyone in show business wants to be.
**Photography**
Photography was created by 19th-century artists as a new form of art. These artists wanted a lasting and accurate record of what they saw around them, and they found it. The new combination of light, lens, shutter, and a flat surface with light-sensitive chemicals made images that were more lasting, more real, and more detailed than what painters could create in weeks or months. This worried other artists, and after their first excitement about this new kind of image, art critics said that photography was not real art. They believed that because photography depended on machines, it couldn't be a product of human creativity. Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new art form. They used their tools like other artists used brushes and pencils—to show their view of the world, nature, and the people in it.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, when book illustrations were in black and white, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also included many novels for older readers, although over time, fewer books were printed, and illustrations became less common. Children's publishing was still very active, but it was often done on a low budget, which led to a lot of average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. The black-and-white archive is a mix of both ordinary and amazing work, a great place for research or just looking around. The real treasures will come back to public attention, either through reprints of old books, new books about the artists, or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and people are beginning to appreciate this artistic period again. Eventually, a smart publisher will see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This made people realize that sharing too much online can be risky. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering dreams of wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we find out that it can be dangerous and confusing.
Feeling worried? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the problems of being famous, all before social media existed. These early users, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. If we don't learn from history, we might repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was invented at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people came to see his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. His work was bold and artistic.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. She was upset and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"'Enough Sleep? Many people today feel tired all the time. In busy and rich countries, more people have trouble sleeping and feel anxious. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep problems. In Britain, some popular books talk about people who can't sleep or about sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, why we need it, and what happens when we can't sleep. A main idea is that 'People need more sleep,' says a top sleep researcher. 'When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic.' A sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to sleep about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting. In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and how dangerous it is to drive when tired. They find volunteers in student newspapers. Volunteers are paid and asked to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner says some people worry because they put electrodes on their heads, but they can't see dreams or thoughts. The lab is more interested in physical things. They have a driving simulator in a dark room. Volunteers come at 2 pm, after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road on the screen goes on and on, the sun is bright, and the room is warm. Many young men say they won't fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one trying not to. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts blinking and nodding off. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but the car has already gone off the road. Coffee might help. Dr. Reyner says two cups can make you a safe driver for half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests using tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated gum to stay awake. Shift workers might find these helpful. What do we know for sure about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. When asleep, they go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams happen in the lightest sleep, and the brain stops the body from moving to prevent injuries. Beyond this, we have theories. Some say sleep repairs the body, restores muscles, or rests the brain. But these might also happen when we are awake and relaxed, so we are not sure. Scientists are sure that women sleep half an hour longer than men and that older people need less sleep, but they don't know why. When asked why we sleep, some researchers say, 'Sleep helps us pass time safely.' In the past, people may have slept differently. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850 in Britain, people had two sleeps. They went to bed at nine or ten, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for an hour, and then slept again. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people enjoyed this quiet time the most. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, the rich started sleeping like we do now. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours, changing sleep patterns for most. Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until recently. In some places, there are no strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then get up. A full night's sleep is not common. In some tribal societies, noise and the need to watch for danger make continuous sleep impossible. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.'"
CPE_60,C2,"'I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots, standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I had the full cowboy outfit, but I wasn't a real cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn't belong there. I had flown in from Denver and thought I might look like a cowboy, but that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweaty T-shirt, needed a shave, and had a dirty bag. He looked at my new boots and walked away. 
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But I don't race anymore. I wondered what I should do now. I thought I could commentate on races, but there were already many former drivers doing that. I also tried to sell classic cars, but it didn't work out because nobody was buying. Being an 'ex' anything is hard. People don't want to hear about how I almost became a World Champion. Even if I had been champion, people would only listen for a short time. 
I don't want sympathy. I had a good career and made money. But I miss racing. I miss the fast cars and the excitement. I miss being famous, even a little. People used to want my autograph. Now, my phone hardly rings, and I have a lot of free time. 
I looked at the sky and saw no buzzards, just some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to tell me to leave. I realized I had a lot to learn about life after racing.'"
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people like to walk around the city, and if you join them, you will probably hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has a mild climate, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe environment, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about the many new buildings, but the new people and tourists have helped the city grow and improve. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a starting point for travel to other places. Even though the name is not used much now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists, like me, are usually not good at writing letters. Some say it's because we don't like writing for free, but I don't think that's true. It's more likely because we try hard to make our writing have a big impact, so we lose the natural feeling of a letter. Real artists, who don't focus on the effect of their words (even if they rewrite a lot), don't have this problem. I think a real artist knows how to use words effectively. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably didn't think about how the long words made them powerful, but it showed he was a great writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In the past, opening a new supermarket in Britain was a big event. A soap opera star, a radio DJ, or a minor royal would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open so often that famous people are not needed. Why pay a celebrity when anyone can do it for free? Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy store didn't care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. One customer heard that the first five men would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud and those at the back feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941, there was a lot of excitement around it. Its release was delayed because the distributors were worried about William Randolph Hearst, who the film was supposedly about. Even though the reviews were mostly very positive, the film did not make much money at first. It was television that made people remember it again. *Citizen Kane* is perhaps the most inspiring film for people who want to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film was successful because he didn't know what he could or couldn't do, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to make a film about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles knew it was a great opportunity for him as both director and actor, and he took it with great energy.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and not to worry if he stopped by the golf club on his way home. He needed to talk to someone, and the golf club was the best place for it. Carmel nodded her head both times, but it seemed like she wasn't really listening. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. It feels almost wrong to just spend the day doing nothing."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And like I said, if I'm late, I won't need anything to eat. So don't worry about it."" ""No, that's fine,"" she replied.
**Title Race**
Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that job titles create divisions among colleagues. Surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would rather have a better job title than a pay raise. If our desire for fancy titles is stronger than our desire for more money, we are in a difficult situation. Today, in the early twenty-first century, nobody wants to be seen as less important. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just nicer ways to say the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"I was in Vienna to take photos. Taking photos was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light looked on different surfaces and how one photo could show the true feeling of a place or person. I always hoped to take the perfect photo, so I kept my camera ready. Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well that became very popular. It was just luck, but it made me famous for a short time. After that, I decided to work for myself, but things didn't go as planned. The mid-1990s were not as successful as I had hoped. That's why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which was good enough for me.
I got the Vienna job by chance. I had taken photos of London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which also included Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the Vienna job, so they asked me to do it. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the other photographers. I was happy to go because things at home were not great. A week in snowy Vienna sounded good to me.
They put me up at a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy summer trip, and I didn't take many photos. This time, in cold January, it felt different. I knew I would enjoy it and take great pictures. On the first day, I just rode the trams around the city to get a feel for it. I hadn't seen Schussner's photos from other seasons because I wanted to make my own version of Vienna.
A photo captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So I waited and looked around until I was ready. The next morning, I went out early. Fresh snow made the city look beautiful and empty. I wanted to photograph the cathedral, but it was hard to capture it all in one shot. Its tall spire and large base made it difficult, but I knew it could still be magical. Photography has always seemed magical, even when you understand how it works. That feeling of mystery stays with you forever. So, when something unexpected happened at Stephansplatz that morning, I wasn't really surprised."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Rejoice**
Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. It has become a place full of wonder, not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or explores the idea of movement. This exhibition shows that making art that moves has been an important but often unnoticed part of art in the last 60 years. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for a long time, has collected many paintings, drawings, documents, and films. Visitors can enjoy the art without many explanations and make their own discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art is liked by many people, even those who usually don't care about art. This might be because his art is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing subjects. Some people might like him because of his interesting personality and humor. Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist, but others say he is popular because people enjoy his work. Hockney knows his limits and does not claim to be a great artist. He believes only time will tell how important his art is.
**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**
I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some good and some not so good. Some shows try to push a certain idea, but this can feel forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. The exhibition, called 'Window-shopping,' was a collection of different artworks that were only connected because they were all art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats moved around on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley's video camera art flickered on a screen. These works were very different, but they worked well together. I didn't try to make a big statement about contemporary art because art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who love paintings sometimes don't want to analyze them because they think it will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus on theory and might ignore the pleasure of looking at art. This is like thinking that knowing how a dish is made will make it taste less good. Understanding more about art can actually make it more enjoyable. Our enjoyment of art is influenced by the society we live in. While it's important to enjoy art with our senses, thinking about art doesn't have to take away from that enjoyment."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**
Stone Age people might have started to like metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish, and finding a shiny yellow stone. This stone was not like other stones; it was gold. Gold was easy to shape, so people wanted it a lot. Copper might have been found by accident too. Once people saw how useful copper tools were, they looked for more copper and learned how to get it from rocks. This is how metalworking became an important skill for our ancestors.
**St Ives**
We walked down the narrow, cobbled street with our bags, fighting against the strong wind and trying not to get wet from the waves crashing over the path. The streets were empty, and all the houses by the water had their windows closed tight against the storm. We saw the weather getting worse as we arrived in St Ives on the small train. The dark clouds made us think that visiting Cornwall without a car in the off-season was not a great idea. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of nice walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived through good and bad times are no longer here. We don't know exactly why they moved or stayed in certain places. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we can't test our ideas with real experiments. We can't watch the past like a movie. But maybe we can use computers to help. Computer modelling lets us create old landscapes and fill them with virtual people. These digital people can act like real humans. We can change things like the weather or the number of people and see how these virtual communities react."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the leader of the group saw a strange male monkey in nearby trees. This stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean trouble for the leader. To stop the stranger, the leader had a clever idea. Every time the stranger tried to come closer, the leader made a loud call that monkeys use to warn about leopards. The stranger got scared and ran back to the trees. This trick worked well until the leader made a mistake. He gave the leopard warning call while walking calmly in the open, which made the trick obvious.
**What Cats Catch**
In the village of Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught. Over a year, 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw this and guessed that all cats in Britain might be killing 100 million birds and small animals each year. However, this is not realistic because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is whether these numbers are too high. The answer seems to be no. Many people feed birds in winter, and gardens provide places for birds to nest. So, the bird population stays high. The survey showed that cats are important hunters, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**
Buffaloes are very important to marsh people. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly and with tired sounds. They stand at the edge of the platform, complaining about the hard day ahead. Finally, the leader moves into the water, and the others follow. In the water, they seem to forget their plans and rest for a while. Slowly, they start swimming, looking like they are almost drowning. They spend the day in the reeds and bulrushes, eating green plants they find.
**PICASSO, Pablo - The Soles 1940**
In 1940, Picasso painted fish still lifes while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's table with a crab and some fish. The fish and crab look alive, even though they are not. Picasso used a flat pattern with overlapping shapes, soft colors, and thin paint. This makes the painting look calm, like an underwater scene. However, there is tension because the fish and crab seem ready to fight. The sharp shapes and a chain around one fish add a feeling of danger. This gives the painting a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this short time, photography has grown to show moments in time and space, letting us see quick moments or very big and very small things. It has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth, parts of the solar system, and the complex and difficult parts of modern life. Photography has become a very important way to show what it means to be human.
But, using pictures to record events has been around for much longer. The first pictures go back to about 35,000 years ago in the Upper Palaeolithic period. We don't know exactly why early humans made cave paintings. They might have shown real hunting events, been used for magic to help with hunting, served as religious symbols, or simply made living spaces more interesting. However, pictures have always been a big part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate pictures are and what their role in society is. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given pictures a special place. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record. The camera, working like the human eye, was seen as a machine that could capture a fixed image, very close to what we actually see. This was a big achievement because artists had worked for centuries to create such images by hand.
People thought that everyone could understand photographs because they seemed so real. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even someone from a remote culture could understand a photo of the sky. However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we began to question if photography could really cross cultural differences. Is photography as tied to culture as language is?
Photography is often seen as providing clear evidence, making it seem like a natural way to communicate. This can blur the line between how we see the world and how it is shown in photos. It's common for someone to show a photo from their wallet and say, ""this is my grandson.""
Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people use it have changed a lot. Photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to becoming part of history. Photos, once close to the photographer and subject, are now historical documents that tell us about the people and society that made them.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography can inspire social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century brought new ways of seeing the world through perspective. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture of today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It's like walking through a field with hidden dangers. You need to be spontaneous, but one wrong move can cause problems. Instead of giving strict rules, it's better to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination be free. Some people need a calm life to write poems, while others write to escape sadness. Some write on a schedule, and others wait for inspiration. All methods are fine as long as you find your own style. Listen to your inner voice, nurture it, and let it grow.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you can't have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used if necessary. A quick memory in the main character's mind can help move the story forward. Dialogue is useful because it can show different sides of a question quickly. It keeps the reader interested and avoids too many words. A short story should be concise but still have conflict and action. Every word should matter.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is like playing chess. At first, you might not know much, but you learn as you go. You make moves without knowing the outcome. Over time, you realize that strategy is more important than quick tactics. You start to see the whole picture and patterns in the game. The more you play, the more you understand its complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Charles Darwin said that speaking is natural for humans, but writing is not. All societies have language, but writing systems were invented only a few times in history. Writing started in complex civilizations and improved slowly. In the past, most children didn't learn to read or write. Even today, many struggle with it. Children naturally learn to speak, but writing is a skill that must be taught. We need to understand how writing works and how to teach it to children."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started writing a book with more doubt. I call it a novel because I don't know what else to call it. I don't have much of a story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up details to fill the gaps and make the story clearer, but I don't want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of people still alive, I have changed their names and made sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When he dies, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe his way of life and his strong and kind character will influence others, and people will realize he was special. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life might find something useful in my book. I think my book will be helpful to those who write about my friend. I don't claim that the conversations I wrote are exact. I never took notes, but I remember well what matters to me. I have written these conversations in my own words, but I believe they are true to what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have added some speeches to make the story more lively, like historians do. I want my book to be interesting to read. The smart reader will know where I have used this trick and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I am worried about writing this book is that the people I write about are from another culture. It is hard to truly know people from a different country. People are shaped by where they were born, the games they played, the food they ate, and the schools they went to. You can't really know these things unless you have lived them. Because of this, it is hard to make foreign characters believable in a book. I usually write about people from my own country, and if I write about others in short stories, it's because you can describe them briefly. In this book, I don't pretend my characters see themselves as I describe them; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**Poetry Recitals**
Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see the patterns and importance of different works. Today, poetry is especially complex with many different styles and opinions about how poetry should be written, shared, and taught. There is a debate between two main groups: serious 'literary' poets who write poems to be read on paper, and 'popular' poets who prefer performing their poems to an audience. 
This division is not strict, and public poetry readings have become more common in the last twenty years. These readings happen in various places like small town halls, schools, colleges, and arts festivals. Poets are often invited to read and talk to audiences. For 'pop' poets, who write their poems to be performed, these events are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand when heard once. However, when read on paper, their weaknesses might be more noticeable.
On the other hand, poets who focus on the craft of poetry, trying to include deep emotions, thoughts, and creativity in their work, might not be fully appreciated by audiences hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simpler works to connect quickly with the audience, which might not show their true style.
Listening to poetry readings is not the same as reading poetry on paper, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing poets read their work can help listeners understand the emphasis and rhythm of the poems. It is helpful if the audience can follow along with the text or know the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music, is to help people enjoy poetry and see it as something fun, not just for a special group of people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**
Historians are using more oral evidence, but it has challenges. When someone tells their story, it is not always a clear picture of the past. During an interview, both the historian and the person being interviewed affect each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to talk about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is influenced by the historian's background and how they understand history. Historians must realize they help create new evidence. Also, the person telling their story is not directly connected to the past. Their memories might be mixed with things they heard from other places, like the media. They might remember the past as better than it was or feel upset about things that happened later. The emotions in their story can make it seem true, but these feelings might come from later events, not the time they are talking about.
**Animal Science**
There are two main ways to study animal science: looking at how the body works and looking at the whole animal. Physiologists study how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create behavior. People who study the whole animal look at the animal's behavior and what affects it. Within this group, psychologists and ethologists are different. Psychologists usually work in labs with animals like rats and pigeons to see how they learn. Ethologists study animals in the wild to see their natural behavior. These two groups are starting to work together more. Physiologists think their methods are very important, but even if we knew everything about how nerves work, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own patterns that we need to understand. Trying to explain a bird building a nest by looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**
When students start studying social sciences, they have to do two things at once. They need to learn about the subject and also understand how to study it. This means knowing the information in textbooks and also learning how this information is found and organized. These two parts are connected. We all know about social life from our daily experiences, so we might think social sciences are just common sense. But, as textbooks show, each social science looks at people in society in a special way. Each one has its own methods and ideas. These basic ideas are what make social sciences different from common sense and from each other.
**Classical Architecture**
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He used some Greek words for these ideas, which probably came from an earlier Greek writer. Vitruvius did not include utility and function in his main definition, but he did talk about the best ways to build for different purposes. At the start, the focus was on architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex. Before the classical style, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy. These huts did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards, but they still influenced later architecture. Even if a classical temple looks fancy, it is basically a simple, single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the allotments, near the railway line and gasworks, even jumping a small bridge with all four wheels off the ground, which was her only mistake. Chen, however, found it amusing when he discovered what Lily had been doing. He was impressed and said, ""So you can really drive it then, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought men were strange because Chen should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and started planning a trip with Lily. They decided to go on a Monday at the beginning of next month, as it was the quietest day of the week. They planned to leave early in the morning and return by midday to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the allotments. Mui, despite her doubts, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
On the day of the trip, they left the house and, within an hour, were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove perfectly, and even Mui, who was ready to give directions from the back seat, had to admit it. Lily overtook a few slow vehicles with great skill, and Chen even applauded her. After passing through the gasworks of a seaside town, they drove along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty parking spaces. She wasn't sure about the road markings, so she preferred to pay a parking fee rather than risk getting towed or fined. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""Don't worry, no one will want that heap of tin,"" which made the sisters upset. Lily accused him of being ungrateful, and Mui told him he was too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took their son, Man Kee, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee on the railing and thought about his son's future. Chen wanted Man Kee to have a good education and own many restaurants one day.
The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful. He saw a ship in the distance and used a telescope to look at it. He imagined it as a special ship that would take them back home one day. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope and said, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It is a special little ship for people like us. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui joined them, and Chen let Lily look through the telescope. But by then, the ship was gone, and all Lily could see were seagulls flying."
CPE_43,C2,"'THE WELL I read somewhere that if you look from a deep hole, you can see stars during the day. I convinced you to help me try this. You watched as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough. You held the handle, but when I pushed the bucket off the well's edge, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. I didn't realize then that I had kind of succeeded in my plan. I saw strange lights, like stars. Later, I thought about how in cartoons, characters see stars when they get hit. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back, but you called again, sounding scared, and I stayed quiet. I watched you through my eyelashes. You ran to get help. I waited a bit, then climbed out of the well and hid in the shadows. I heard voices from the castle. Mother and Father came with you and Arthur. Mother was upset, and Father told Arthur to use the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I felt excited but then saw the wet spots I left on the ground. I was scared they would see them. Mother was screaming, and I felt guilty. I wanted revenge on you, but now it was serious. I realized I needed a plan. I came out of hiding, pretending to be weak. I told them I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled out. I thought they believed me until Father asked me to repeat the story. I added that the tunnel collapsed after me, so no one could check. Father looked at me like he saw through my lie. He told me not to be ridiculous and walked away. Arthur looked at me sadly, knowing I was lying. His look made me feel ashamed, like my father's words. I realized they both saw through my lie, and it made me think about how I would see things when I grew up.'"
CPE_51,C2,"**Moving Day**
Susan, who is now a widow, has to leave her family home because her children are grown up. She noticed the moving van had ""Removers of Distinction"" written on it. Fred, the removal man, was carefully packing everything in the house, while his team was not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that looked over a small harbor. She remembered the years spent there with her children growing up.
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked how they would bring the house home. Now, Robert was helping with the move, making sure Susan didn't mention the piano. Her daughter Francesca was also there, insisting she was the only one careful enough to handle their Steinway piano.
Fred, the removal man, noticed Susan wasn't crying. He said many people cry when they see their things being taken away, but they feel better once they reach the new place. Susan could understand why. She remembered when they first moved in, the piano was a big problem. It got stuck on the stairs, and they had to remove the banister rails to get it in. Her late husband, Peter, solved the problem by hiring a builder to take out a window and using a crane to bring the piano inside.
Now, Susan was worried about moving the piano out. She sat on the stairs, thinking about the past. Fred asked if she was okay, and she moved aside as they prepared to move the piano. Robert and Francesca watched from the hallway. Susan felt like crying because moving made her realize how much everything mattered to her.
Finally, the piano was moved safely out of the house. Robert started laughing, and soon all three of them were laughing together, relieved that the move was over. As they walked down the path for the last time, Susan's tears were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Book Reviews: Fun for Everyone?**
When the Internet started, one big idea was that anyone could share their thoughts online. In the beginning, you needed some technical skills to do this. But there was one area that became open to everyone: book reviews. 
Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, allowed anyone to write a book review. This meant people could share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically. This helped Amazon fill its site with free reviews, and buyers could see what other readers thought, not just what publishers or professional critics said.
Other online bookstores did the same, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the market. Because of this, Amazon had the most reviews and also some problems. Many reviews were submitted every day, so it was hard to check them all. Amazon had a team to make sure reviews followed their rules. For example, reviews couldn't be just one word, attack the author, or spoil the ending. But since reviewers were anonymous, some fake reviews slipped through.
Some authors wrote fake positive reviews for their own books. For example, Lev Grossman wrote good reviews for his book after getting bad ones. He was caught when he admitted it in an article, and the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon didn't always check if the comments were really from the author. 
Sometimes, readers used reviews to express anger. For example, when James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team came out, people mentioned in the book wrote angry reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days.
Despite these issues, Amazon liked that people spent time writing reviews because it was good for business. They watched popular books closely to make sure reviews followed the rules. Funny reviews were more common on less popular books. For example, a children's book called ""The Story about Ping"" inspired jokes because ""ping"" is also a computer term.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious and gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books could be boring. But with everyone able to write reviews, it became a more interesting and fair process."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last 200 years, people often think that artists must be different from others. We like art that is unique, new, and sometimes shocking. We admire artists whose work was not liked 100 years ago. But with today's art, we sometimes feel unsure and think an artist has gone too far. The media often tells us what to think, and we agree because we expect art to be new and confusing. We forget that modern art also has old themes and methods. We want artists to be special and different from us, with talents that break the rules. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and it was part of everyday life. Now, we let artists do what they want and get upset if they try to be like everyone else.
**Picture This**
Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" The artist asks someone to make a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My question is: Is this a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th, there is an unspoken rule that once a painter finds success in one style, they should stick to it. Collectors want artists to keep doing the same thing, and trying something new can upset them. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have changed styles and succeeded. Eric Rimmington is another artist trying something new. He is known for still life paintings but now paints the London Underground. He has always been interested in railways and has made 40 paintings and drawings of the underground world for his new show, ""Underground Encounters.""
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. The villagers joke that only a sick person would come to such a remote place to heal. I am alone except for an old woman who comes to clean the house. I am neither happy nor unhappy, just thinking about memories. I talked about how art seems useless but did not mention its comforts. The comfort in art is that it allows us to change reality and see its true meaning. Our everyday actions hide the real beauty of life. For artists, art is a way to deal with what hurts us in life, not to avoid it, but to understand it better. Otherwise, why do we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"Title: Family Business
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my fancy girls' school. I had won the Latin prize and the prize for doing best in my exams. My father had talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. He usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I said, trying to act brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was about to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV dramas.""
""Be that as it may,"" he said, ""I feel your heart's not going to be in the family business now. You'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting it.""
Like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by family expectations. I saw other jobs I could do and wanted to explore them. But I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things, ""and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, sulking. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant.""
My mother wasn't around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised Maurice and me. Maurice was two years younger, and I got used to taking care of him. It wasn't hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, nice schools, clothes, parties, theatres, and operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always lively.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate decisions and to avoid my father's sulks if I opposed him. This was how he controlled us.
So it happened. In my last term at school and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always on safer tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a little house, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label for my final exams.
In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew if I focused, he might be right. I felt confident and ready.
But my father told me he needed me for one last important job for the family business, and it would be worth my while.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams soon, and I need to focus on them. It's really important that I do well.""
I could tell my father didn't understand the pressure I felt, or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him. He would see a refusal as a betrayal.
As he explained the job, I saw how focused and talented my father was. He was a sort of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with his wife, Lois. They could only afford it by being very careful with money, which wasn't ideal. At first, it seemed like a good idea because Simon had many successful cases, and Lois had returned to her job at an advertising agency after having twins. She even got a raise, making her salary thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted a better address for their social status. 
To save money, Lois decided one of them should use public transport. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube, which made him unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he was treated well after a long day. But times had changed, and Lois made it clear that her career was as important as Simon's. They needed both their salaries to maintain their lifestyle.
Now, their situation was at risk because of Venetia, who was very upset. She accused Simon of knowing that a client, Brian Cartwright, had bribed jurors in a case four years ago and that Cartwright had given shares to Simon's fiancée. Simon denied it, but his denial didn't sound convincing, even to himself. He felt guilty and remembered feeling scared of punishment as a child. Venetia didn't believe him, and he worried about what she might do. If the rumor spread, his career could be ruined."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose to live here because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were overgrown. But I was wrong. People in the shops start to recognize you, even if you don't feel like you're living a real life. The roses next door remind me that the gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about summer, but tonight I'm watching birds fly between the trees and roofs. I cleared some space in the garden for a chair, and my arms are scratched from the plants. It's a small London garden where plants grow tall to survive. 
My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of the window. She's written several unpublished books, and as an English teacher, I sometimes have to pretend to like them. I have her latest book now. 'How's the work going, Jaz?' I ask. 'In no other job do people ask you about your work all the time,' she replies. Then she says, 'I'll bring something to drink.' I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 'You're on holiday now,' she says, sitting in the chair. 'I should've been a teacher - writers don't get holidays. They say those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.' And some can't do either. 'What are your plans for the holidays?' she asks. 
I feel worried about the school year ending. Empty days, hot streets, and loneliness in the park. 'I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats?' I ask, feeling nervous. 'Of course,' Jaz says, knowing she will be around. 'Where will you stay?' she asks. 'With my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun,' I lie. 'Going back to your roots. What do you think of my book?' Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven't finished reading. I like the title and tell her. I decide to be honest. 'Try writing about nice people for a change,' I suggest. 'Teachers!' Jaz replies like a student upset about a bad grade. 'I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,' I say. 'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,' Jaz says. 
I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the train. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calm. Then I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking and saying, 'I've had my moments.' We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it helps people feel connected to the past. We often know about our personal heritage, like who our grandparents were and stories about their lives. But we also need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity, helping us feel part of history. Just like we inherit genes, we also inherit culture from past generations. Even if there are parts of our national heritage we don't like, it is still ours, and it helps us feel connected. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It affects everything from customs to things we use every day. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. But now, because of changes in society, many of these stories are lost. Instead, places and buildings help us remember the past. It is important to keep and restore these links to honor our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I started writing a novel called ""Waterland,"" where the landscape of the Fens in England became important. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about it. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good setting for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not just flat and empty. They are as English as any other place but also very unique and mysterious. Many English people find the Fens foreign, even though other unique areas in Britain are part of the nation's culture. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and both open and mysterious. While writing my novel, I didn't visit many places in the Fens. As a fiction writer, I like to imagine worlds rather than rely on facts. The Fens are not just a place but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels. Now, displays should be interesting and use creative techniques to capture visitors' attention. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide boxes of objects for teachers to use in class or for helping elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real items, not copies. They show things that were used and had meaning in the past. This is what makes them different from heritage centers and theme parks. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will find that people interested in virtual history will also want to see the real things that only museums can offer.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. Some people become strong preservationists, while others think about the future of towns. People who have lived through big events like world wars may care more about preserving things because they value stability. If there is a need to preserve, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, like our population, well-being, and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used in ads for smart products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people don't know much about what Einstein did, except that he created theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don't match everyday life. Einstein was part of a big change in science, which started modern science in the 20th century. Scientists were trying to describe the universe better by studying matter and natural forces. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking basic ideas like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people believed in Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this by saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were kids, Lydia and I didn't trust books that won prizes because we thought they would be boring. Our mother didn't like this attitude, but our father would give us small amounts of money to encourage us to read these books. He would also give us better books as gifts, marking them with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. We called most of these 'boys' books', but sometimes we found good short stories and once, a famous book of poems.
**Language**
In 1851, Jacob Grimm wrote that the origin of human language is a secret and amazing thing. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad, and people in dangerous places made desperate noises. Some words today might still have echoes of these sounds, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" or the Latin 'mors' meaning ""death"". Because of these odd ideas, many people avoided talking about language origins, thinking it was for crazy people. But now, the origin and evolution of language are important research areas. Language probably started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. It was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in power struggles. Sharing information was not its main purpose, even though philosopher John Locke thought language was a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"'Writing Reviews Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from a writer's point of view. Most reviews are written quickly and don't last long. They have deadlines and are usually short. Once published, they are only read for a short time, like a day or a week. People often think reviews are not very important. Many believe that writers do reviews because they need money or because they can't work on their main projects all the time. However, writing reviews is a skillful job. It's different to write a short review for a newspaper than a long one for an international journal. A reviewer must think about who will read the review, from casual readers to those very interested in the topic. Reviewers need to know a lot about different things and write clearly so people can understand and enjoy their writing. Reviewers often write other things besides reviews. For example, the American novelist John Updike writes reviews between writing his novels. He collects his reviews into books, even if they are short. Some people think only famous writers should keep their reviews, but others believe anyone can do it if they want to. I feel the same about my work. My main job is academic, and my serious books are academic too. In the English-speaking world, it's common for the same people to write both reviews and academic books. In the past, some academics didn't like professors writing reviews, but now it's more accepted. There is more reviewing work now, so many people can do it. I think this is good for readers because they know the reviewer understands the topic. It's also good for professors because it helps them stay connected to the real world. When professors talk to each other, they might use complex language, but when writing reviews, they need to be clear. In the end, reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well.'"
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and walked into the dark, quiet hallway. Even after three years, he sometimes felt a little unsure about owning the place when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the apartment, he would come home excited and curious, often as early as possible, wondering what the apartment had been like while he was away. It felt like a welcoming place where he was in control. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or leaks, but the apartment always seemed to be waiting for him, either tidy or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as just another part of himself, a space filled with his thoughts and feelings. He became frustrated that he couldn't change it. Sometimes, there would be a small pile of letters by the door or a blinking light on the answering machine when he returned. He was glad the windows weren't broken and nothing was stolen, but he wondered what it would look like if something happened. From his dull office on Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to spending three or four quiet evenings at home each week. Once he left the busy office and started to feel like himself again on the bus ride home, he realized he didn't need to be alone, but he often forgot this when planning his social life. At his desk, he wanted to be alone with his things, but once he got home, he felt empty and waited for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him think that doing work he didn't like had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was. He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. His thoughts and feelings were unclear, and he couldn't find a connection. He remembered a time when he didn't feel so powerless, when he might have escaped if he had known his own worth. But he was eager to settle down with something, so he followed the first opportunity that came along. After university, he tried to make a plan for his future, but he only wanted to survive quietly. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends and followed their paths, not thinking he could find a job that would make him happy. He went to one job interview and didn't think much about the job itself, which was an editorial role at a free local newspaper. He was just happy to have a nice conversation with Neil, his boss, and didn't think about the long meetings he would have later. Neil offered him the job right away, saying Ralph was the only graduate who applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I moved through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse, and I tried to find a good spot. A part of the area was marked off for the race. It wasn't like big racecourses, but people stood on both sides of the track to watch the goats run. Keeping the goats in order was hard because goats are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We hadn't seen any villages or huts since the morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our torch to see the cliffs, but the torch batteries were dying. We put in new ones, but they didn't work. We couldn't find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley thought she saw a light, and we felt hopeful. But it was just moonlight on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud noise of fast water, but we couldn't see it. Time seemed to stop as we moved on.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and big shareholders. How can I get better at presentations and feel more confident? You are not alone. Presenting is a different skill from running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask colleagues to think of difficult questions the audience might ask. Start with something everyone agrees on and slowly build to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They need their own time. For example, if you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you add oil too quickly when making mayonnaise, it will not turn out right. If you pull too hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things we can do very quickly, like solving puzzles or doing math in our heads. But other things take longer, and if we rush them, they might not work well, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
We learn and think in different ways, and each way has its own speed. Sometimes we need to think fast, like when we are in danger. For example, when I was riding my motorbike and it skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe. This fast reaction is a kind of intelligence called 'wits'.
Then there is the kind of thinking where we solve problems by reasoning and logic. This is called 'intellect'. A mechanic fixing an engine or a student working on an assignment uses this kind of thinking. We call people who are good at this 'bright' or 'clever'.
There is also a slower way of thinking, which is more relaxed and dreamy. This is when we are daydreaming or just thinking about things without a clear purpose. It is important to let our minds wander sometimes. This slow thinking helps us understand complex situations better. It is like the story of the tortoise and the hare; we need both fast and slow thinking.
Recent studies show that slow thinking is good for understanding complicated problems. When we don't know what questions to ask or when the problem is too complex, slow thinking can help. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long known the value of this kind of thinking. Scientists are now studying it too, and they find that our minds can solve difficult problems if we give them time."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly in a friendly and well-supplied camp in a very remote place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, and weather experts. We all work together closely. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not for casual conversation. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a big problem for me, but at first, it made me feel less confident. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure which table to sit at, and worried about the silence when I spoke. I felt anxious, like when I first started school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this sometimes makes me feel down because I am not as socially confident as I used to be.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he didn't pay much attention to me. He never forgot a face, though, and when we met again, he would shake my hand politely but didn't try to become friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he often pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and Elliot started to like me more. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success, I made many new friends and began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said he didn't care much about the story or acting in his films. He cared more about the photography, music, and technical parts. For Hitchcock, it wasn't the message or acting that excited people. He believed that people reacted to the film itself, no matter where they were from. If a film was made well, people from Japan and India would react the same way. Hitchcock was very precise and logical. He was a genius who loved to hear the audience scream. He didn't focus on ideas or deep meanings. He focused on making films that had a strong emotional impact on the audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
In the last 50 years, many things have changed in astronomy. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues. Telescopes were not very advanced, and there were few books about practical astronomy. Today, you can buy many different telescopes and equipment. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might need to travel 80 km to see a sky as clear as it was in cities 50 years ago. During the day, airplane trails can stay in the sky for hours and turn into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are many things to do and many options. People always want the newest product or service, and technology makes changes happen faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can mean more stress, less time, and more complexity. People are now looking for 'simplexity' - simple things that bring meaning in a complex world. But simplifying life is hard when there are so many products and services. There are more types of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and phone plans than we can follow.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. We do not let anything change this tradition. The people who stay at McAndrews are similar: old-fashioned and maybe a bit snobbish. I do not like the rude behavior of shop assistants today, and I do not like waiters who try to be too friendly. I know the names of most of the other guests because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. But I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. It is hard to find such respect for privacy in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**
A special performance of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"" has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a review I wrote when the show first started last spring. I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello and criticized his acting. I still think it's not right to ignore the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but I was wrong about Mr. Fearon's acting. His performance is amazing. The whole cast is excellent. Some memorable scenes include Cassio's dangerous games with other officers and the moment when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The pace and tension are great throughout the play. Don't miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the middle of Antarctica, there is no movement. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the large white plateau inside, there is no life. Except for a huge hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange creatures live there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to uncover the lake's secrets. If they succeed, the next few years will be known as the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
There was an interesting discussion on the radio last week. It seems that some scientists are very excited about why they become scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it's the old search for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to know all this in the first place and why science can't explain our curiosity. It seems more important to know if what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we do science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Food is very important and makes us feel good. Many people think cooking is only for special occasions or difficult dishes, but that's not true. You can make a tasty soup by just putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is better than buying soup in a packet or can. Instead of buying a chocolate mousse with lots of chemicals, you can make a delicious one in five minutes that everyone will love. Cooking is a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important in our lives, which is why we celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and other events with meals. No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! And people usually don't discuss business deals over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms and other documents were piled up, waiting to be organized. He also had many books and journals near the new bookshelves. As he went up in the elevator, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She was always punctual and neat. He wondered how she would react to the mess. Maybe she would think someone had broken in. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, came while he was trying to tidy up. He hoped she would help, but she just went into his apartment, which was her responsibility. She thought of him as someone from far away, not from her world in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story of strength. A key moment was when she was twelve, and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. She thought she would be blind, but the doctor said her eye was fine, and she only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, talking about miracles, Karen felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was walking across the village green, feeling both excited and sad. She had just learned something important, which was exciting because her life was usually quiet. But she was also very sad about Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years and was always kind and patient. He made people feel like he had all the time in the world to listen to their worries. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. But she also writes books for young children learning the piano. Joanna is known for her amazing piano skills. She plays many types of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, one boy asked her to play ""Match of the Day."" Joanna found it funny and played it, showing she is a real pianist in the boy's eyes.
Joanna is different from many top pianists because she cares about how children learn the piano. She wrote a piano book for kids called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" She did this even though she has a very busy schedule. She is involved in many music festivals, runs her own recording label, and likes to work with other artists.
Joanna believes the first piano lessons are very important. She thinks music should be for everyone, not just for those who want to be stars. When she was younger, she taught beginners and saw many children learn piano at her home, where her mother was a piano teacher. She wants everyone to have a chance to learn music, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.
Some children learn piano quickly, but Joanna is interested in those who take their time. Many kids stop learning because they feel pressure to be perfect. Joanna worries that some parents push their kids too hard in music, like in sports. She thinks music should be fun and enjoyable.
Joanna's piano books are colorful and have stories to make learning fun. She includes different music styles for teachers or parents to play with the child. If parents can't play, the music is on CDs. Joanna believes learning should be fun and encourages kids to try different things on the piano.
As children get better, they need to learn to read music, not just play by ear. Joanna understands this because she also relied on her ear when she was young. But she knows practice is the most important thing. She didn't practice a lot until she went to the Royal Academy of Music. Now, she practices eight hours a day, which is very important to her.
Joanna says the key to practice is knowing what you want to achieve. She suggests playing the whole piece, even with mistakes, and mixing hard and easy pieces."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson once said that writing without effort is often not enjoyable to read. This means that good writing is usually difficult to create. When I look at my old school essays, I notice there are not many mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard work. Writing slowly helps you think carefully. When you write by hand, you are more careful because it is hard to change or erase. But with computers, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find that they spend as much time fixing their computer drafts as they did writing by hand. Also, emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. Some people say emails have brought back the art of love letters, but they often lack the emotion and care of handwritten ones. Words on a screen can seem boring and are often written quickly without much thought.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not special, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. ""Aren't they amazing?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back. I agreed and gave the disc to him carefully. ""It's incredible they can hold seventy minutes of music,"" he said, turning on the music player. He pressed a button, and a small drawer came out. He put the disc in and pressed the button again, and the drawer went back in. ""Some people say they sound too clean, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. ""No,"" Mr. Warriston said. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""I don't know. You could have two sides and double the music..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Good question."" He pointed to my chair. ""Let's get you in the best spot to hear the music."" I was happy to ask a question he couldn't answer.
**Books versus Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were invented after lighters, we would think they were amazing. People often say electronic text is as important as the invention of printing, but they forget that big changes take time. In 1979, a book said that books would disappear in the 1980s. That was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so most people don't do it. Computers make it easy to read small parts of text. Some people say this is a new way of storytelling, but reading parts of a book is not new. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from start to finish. The problem with computers is that they don't encourage reading a whole text.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything was in order. The carpet was clean, and the desk was just as he remembered it. Files were in their drawers, and trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen tried to close the filing cabinet and then spoke to him. ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, looking at the room. He didn't think about adding a computer or any machine, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had talked about this many times. She didn't understand why he didn't like technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. She was the reason for that paper. She could use a keyboard to change any software into something new."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She wasn't really asking because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She sometimes forgot because he wasn't supposed to be there often. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that if he stayed away, things would go wrong. He thought about how he went from being an important advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to someone always trying to stop problems, with no parking space at work. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn't want to see another synopsis. He wanted to see a ""First Draft."" Ian Cuthbert had been given a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was an old friend, but Lancelot realized it was a mistake to ask friends to write books. Ian was unpredictable. Lancelot read the synopsis and recognized almost everything. He closed the folder. It seemed Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis was not brilliant and felt like Ian had lost interest. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death. Ian's advance was large, which was not a good business decision. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising talent at Cambridge. Ian's friends took over British theatre quickly, but Ian's talent stayed hidden. He was difficult to work with. He was supposed to edit an arts magazine but never published it. He had a contract with a fashion magazine but didn't produce much. At meetings, Ian was critical and didn't like others' ideas. Ten years later, he was unreliable. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"'The change in breakfast habits in England
Health experts say breakfast is very important. But in history, breakfast is quite new in England. In medieval times, breakfast was not often mentioned in stories. Sometimes, travelers ate early before long trips, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 
In the sixteenth century, breakfast became normal for everyone. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. But there were also big social changes. For example, people started working set hours, often starting very early. So, eating in the morning became necessary, not just for the rich.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences. They also think about social and cultural rules. In this book, we will see how these things change the style, content, and feeling of a photo. We will also learn how people look at and react to these images. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they might think they understand the photos. But instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we can ask if it really shows what happened. Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment important, or is the photo a symbol of something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just playing. The best people in sport believe in themselves completely. You need to focus only on your goal if you want to succeed. There is only one way to be the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. You either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, and it also shows the value of working in a team. My sport lets you be great on your own, but it is also a team game, so you have to balance both. It's like life - you can do well alone, but you must remember others are around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened many opportunities for me and let me see things around the world that others might not see. But you also have to give up a lot for these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences stay very clear in our memory. For me, one special moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree. I don't usually have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex songs, I felt like I was in a new artistic world. To understand the bird's music, I thought about my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing a special, live performance. I reacted with surprise and joy as the bird sang different tunes through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what do these feelings say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 
In a greenhouse, a small brown bird called a wren is hitting the glass. Some people think wrens bring messages or signs. Is it trying to tell me something, or is it just stuck? Maybe both are true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed the direction a wren flew could bring good or bad luck. Today, we still see wrens in art and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens are still important to us. A forest without wrens feels empty. 
This connection with birds comes from old stories and beliefs. In the past, people depended on nature to survive and created stories to explain the world around them. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once common in London and seen as helpful. Later, people thought of them as pests, and they disappeared from most places except Wales. Now, red kites are protected and are a symbol of conservation in Britain.
Our connection with birds is deep and goes back to early human history. Early humans watched birds to learn about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about what it means to be human. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which we admire and want to understand.
Some people might think our feelings about birds are old and not important now. But like parts of our body we don't need anymore, losing these feelings can be hard. Birds are now seen as indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger, which is sad not only because we lose these birds but also because we lose part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing have special meanings in stories and poems. Losing them is a cultural loss.
Folklore, or traditional stories, is important. These stories have a strong connection to birds and are more powerful than scientific facts. They help us feel and understand things about birds that science can't explain. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel is hard to describe with science. Birds are fascinating, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their messages. The wren in the greenhouse is like a puzzle, connecting the present with the past and future, and it keeps me curious."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
A map shows how places and features on Earth relate to each other. This is done using distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like ""a day's walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This told more about how easy it was to travel through the area than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Because of this, written travel guides were popular for a long time, just like maps. Even today, some maps, like train maps, might not show true directions. Early maps used signs to show important landmarks along a route, and these signs could be realistic or symbolic. The style of these signs changed depending on the map's purpose and where it was made. So, when studying old maps, it's important to understand the style used.
The history of making maps, or cartography, is about getting better at showing distance and direction accurately and adding more details to maps. To improve maps, cartographers used other sciences. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, they used the magnetic compass. They also created tools to measure angles accurately. As people explored more of the world, they tried to map it. Astronomers found out that Earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flat at the poles, which helped improve maps of large areas.
Over time, different people needed maps for different reasons. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for planning battles, especially with the use of artillery. This led to the invention of contour lines to show land features. Archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps for their work. Today's map makers, or cartographers, create maps showing many things, like rock layers, weather patterns, and land use. The value of maps in many sciences has led to a modern revival of map-making.
The development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of fast development. Sometimes old ideas stayed around even when new ones were available. Cartographers often knew how to improve maps but had to wait for better tools. Since it was easy to copy old maps, and because a lot of money was invested in printing them, map makers were sometimes slow to accept new ideas. Therefore, maps should not always be seen as perfect evidence of what people knew at the time. The many maps we have today show a lot of human effort and thought. They are a valuable record of human history, making the study of old maps both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"'TIM RICE I was invited into a young man's living room, which was a nice and organized space compared to the messy rooms around it. Moving from the kitchen to his living room felt like going from economy to business class on a plane. He had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, and he had even bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting. During this time, he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as crazy; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not as serious to me, though I can say that now. They might have been if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy dream for me, to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I was willing to try. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting, he played me three tunes he had composed, and I could tell he was very good. As he played more music from shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' record collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn't have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written, which an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier. We promised to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but on the bus back to my flat, I thought I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be crazy to miss the chance to work with him. Even if we didn't become top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a lawyer, my brief certainty of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber faded a bit. I would keep looking for groups needing a vocalist and write more simple songs that suited my voice, but it seemed likely I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying because if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But in the meantime, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and write lyrics like musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was interesting and talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was clear, and he said he had all the contacts. I soon returned to his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. His story was worthy, but it didn't really excite me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the project was not very original, similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and not completely wrong. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the songs meant to be funny. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the title, most of which had probably been thought up by his previous lyricist friend. I skipped a day at the lawyer's office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn't know it that day, but I had changed careers.'"
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**
Humans have a special ability: we can communicate with each other very precisely using language. Language is so important in our lives that it's hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably start talking. Even when alone, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk naturally, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders didn't learn web-making from a special spider school; it's something they just know how to do.
**Climate and Weather**
Climate and weather, created by the air around us, have a big impact on where animals and plants live. Climate can change how landscapes look. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow, which have many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather patterns, which make up the climate over time, happen because large amounts of air move and mix. The air moves because the earth spins, and the air doesn't move as fast as the earth. The sun is also a big reason for air movement.
**Coffee**
As a bar-person, I had to serve drinks and make coffee, which was a bit scary. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, especially how to clean and use the restaurant's espresso machine. I also learned how to make a perfect cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized making good coffee was harder than it looked, and I thought I might be moved to simpler tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often fail with programs about visual arts like painting and sculpture? These should be easy for the camera to show because it can display the whole artwork and then zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that successfully show both the enjoyment and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's series ""American Visions,"" which is about American art. Hughes is a trustworthy critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored by British galleries. I thought the series would focus on great artworks, but instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is less controlled than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. But now, the economists who said the market would keep the price of rare metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken out of the ground, and the cost of raw materials is going down. Considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something special. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. Or, you can rent a boat if you want to travel on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that you can find treasures. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Title: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK
At the Bamboo Bike Club in London, you can join a course to build your own bamboo bike. The club is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. They offer a weekend course where you can create a custom bike frame designed on a computer.
Bamboo is becoming popular in bike building. Companies like Calfee Design in California and Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have brought back this old method. However, buying a ready-made bamboo bike can be expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable, so they started their own business.
Instead of just selling bikes, they wanted to share the fun of making them. The Bamboo Bike Club is more like a community project. James and Ian both have full-time jobs; James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can build your own bike for a reasonable price.
During the course, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and make strong joints. You start by building the front triangle of the bike with bamboo tubes. Metal tubes are used for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. James and Ian help you with every step, making sure everything is done correctly.
Building the bike yourself is a big part of the fun. Even if you make mistakes, you can try again with a new piece of bamboo. On the second day, you wrap the joints with hemp and glue them with epoxy resin to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts.
Bamboo bikes are strong and can last a long time. Ian has used his bike for over a year on a long commute, and James has tested his off-road. The bikes are designed to be very strong, even more than needed.
Bamboo bikes look different from professional metal bikes. They might look a bit rough, but they are unique. James and Ian believe that this individuality is important. Bamboo bikes are great for a relaxed ride, not for racing. They are light and smooth to ride, making them fun to use.
The best part? You can build your own bamboo bike for less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she found a book by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought the book would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Dione Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book is about how men and women can communicate better. This book is very popular in the self-help industry, which is growing fast. People in America want to improve their lives, and these books try to help them. The self-help industry is also important for New York publishing. In Britain, many self-help books are published, but not all are good. Many books are rejected because they are too similar to others or too specific. Editors look for books that can sell well. They ask questions like, ""Is the author easy to promote? Is the idea interesting to many people?"" Dione Reverend says that a catchy title is very important for a book's success.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an unspoken agreement with the reader that they are telling the truth. However, writers often do not tell the whole truth. They might leave out things that are too embarrassing or seem unimportant. Sometimes, writers make up stories to show a deeper truth about themselves. Some writers might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. Readers might think they are reading a true story, but it could be fiction. This is not always done to deceive people.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
Detective stories became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These stories often show the conflicts in society. A crime in a detective story represents human desires like greed, and solving the crime shows how society can work well again. In Dashiell Hammett's stories, society is shown as corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is both a part of the law and a bit of a criminal. He is both a crook and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels connected to the criminal, and sometimes he is very eager to catch them because of this connection.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at the Grand Hotel to talk about writing. Gould believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the scientific community. He says you should never write down to the reader. You can make the language simpler, but you should not change the main ideas. If readers feel they are being talked down to, they will not like the writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym in the City of London, the air feels very cold. This gym is popular with people who work nearby. Because of the very hot summer, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels as cold as the Arctic inside. This is an example of how people often use too much air-conditioning. Air-conditioning is now a big part of our lives, showing how we can change the climate around us. But many buildings could stay cool in other ways. They could use natural light and air, and have thicker walls that keep out heat during the day and release it at night. These simple ideas can really help and would mean we need less air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches got better, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, people are interested in them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts working. Sundials are calm and romantic, reminding us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I used to think china-painting was only for very skilled people. I once saw older women at an arts show painting teacups with perfect flowers. They were so good that it seemed like they had been doing it for many years or were just very talented. I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would beginners be as good? But when I visited a class, it was not scary at all. The students were there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers quickly like a machine."
CPE_47,C2,"Uncle chose a holiday package for Keith and Dawne at a good price. It included a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to book the trip, the travel agent told them that they would be with a school group learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Instead of Venice, Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. On the plane, they noticed people speaking with North of England accents. Keith thought maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and relaxed.
When they arrived, a woman with glasses told everyone to stay together. Keith thought there was an overnight stop, but when they reached the hotel, it was late, and they were tired. They accepted the room for the night. The next morning, they realized they were booked for the whole holiday in Switzerland. The receptionist told them about the lake and boat trips to Interlaken.
Keith tried to explain the mistake, saying they were supposed to be in Venice. The receptionist didn't know about any mistake. Dawne described the travel agent who booked their trip. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they saw at Gatwick, tried to help. She explained that many holidays have similar tickets and labels, which might have caused the mix-up.
Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks left to check, and Keith thought about everything that happened. An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Nottage, talked to them about how well they slept. Keith and Dawne realized the irony: they wanted a holiday away from elderly people, but ended up on a tour with them. Uncle had suggested the trip to help them escape the demands of older people."
CPE_48,C2,"Title: Ernest Shackleton: A Model for Modern Management
American business leaders are now looking at Ernest Shackleton, a famous polar explorer, as a great example of good leadership. In Britain, many people know about Shackleton and his adventures. However, in America, he is only recently becoming popular. The Wall Street Journal called him ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements were mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which might be an exaggeration. But now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about his journey on the ship Endurance are being written, and a big exhibition is being prepared by the American Museum of Natural History. Columbia Tristar is also making a movie about his life.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his leadership and communication skills. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has been inspired by Shackleton for many years. His company deals with communication during difficult times, like when a company's factory has an accident or when many employees are laid off. MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great example because he was a strong leader and communicator. Shackleton made tough decisions, like turning back from the South Pole in 1908 to save his team, showing that he valued their lives above all.
Shackleton's most famous expedition was in 1914 when his ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice and was eventually crushed. Despite this, Shackleton kept his team safe and motivated. He planned carefully, kept his men informed, and was open to their ideas. He was adaptable and ready to change plans if needed. MacGregor says Shackleton's story helps clients understand leadership without feeling criticized.
Shackleton believed an explorer needed optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor points out that sometimes doing nothing is the hardest thing, especially in America, where people want quick solutions. Shackleton showed that sometimes it's better to wait and not rush into decisions. He also led by example, like when he gave his gloves to a team member who didn't have any or shared a biscuit when food was scarce.
Caroline Alexander, who wrote a book about Shackleton's expedition, says people today admire heroic efforts like Shackleton's because they feel there are not many true heroes now. Shackleton stands out as a real example of the ideals people miss today."
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar's Forests In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives a bit like a woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and the aye-aye look for insect larvae inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long, thin third finger to reach and scoop out the insects. Scientists have known about the aye-aye's feeding habits for over a hundred years, but only recently learned how it finds insects inside the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of some aye-ayes named Nosferatu, Poe, Samantha, and Annabelle. He wanted to see if they found insects by looking for signs on the wood, like small holes. He gave them logs with drilled holes. Some holes had mealworms, and others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, without needing to see the holes. Dr. Erickson tested if they used smell or sound to find the insects. Even when the smell was blocked, the aye-ayes found the mealworms, even if they were dead and silent. So, how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that aye-ayes tap the wood with their middle finger and listen with their big ears. They might be using echo-location, like bats, to find hollow spaces where insects might be. The aye-aye might also hear insects moving when it taps. Some people think the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar, but there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is like a mix of a woodpecker, a bat, and a squirrel. Its teeth grow like a squirrel's, and it can also open nuts with its long finger to eat the inside.'"
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary people, ordinary lives Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but do we really know what their lives were like when they were young? Old diaries give us small, incomplete glimpses, and family stories are often forgotten. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but they are still just images. Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary ones. The idea came to her when she talked to her family and realized how much of the past was disappearing. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""People say they do it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves."" The promise of privacy helps people be honest. A 62-year-old man who made and lost a fortune said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful things, like my divorce."" He did it for his family, hoping they could learn something, but hasn't let his children read it yet. He thinks they should read it after he is gone. He also saw patterns from his childhood that led to repeated mistakes. Ms. Renier has noticed this in others too. ""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things from childhood affect them for life. They marry people their parents would like or do the opposite to rebel."" Many people still feel disappointed about things with their parents, even 60 years later. They try to impress a parent who wasn't impressed, and some want to say, ""I can't stand my mother."" Ms. Renier listens but doesn't judge. ""It's not for the public, and I'm not there to be nosy. People sometimes tell me things and then aren't sure if it should be included. I put it in, and they can remove it later. But usually, people want to be honest."" ""It's not about showing off. Things are changing fast, and we are losing touch with the past. This gives us roots. We need a connection to our ancestors because families don't stay together like they used to. People want a little immortality."" Each book takes up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story. Modern technology helps her make everything except the book cover. You can choose your own cover color and title. The books are interesting to the family they are for and are not about revealing secrets. Ms. Renier organizes the material well, and the final book is as good as its subject. The book looks nice and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. She gets about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost stops many people. ""I thought it would be more affordable,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are usually wealthy, like readers of Harpers & Queen, where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their descendants.""'"

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of Greek and Roman sculpture casts in the world, with over six hundred pieces. Remember, nothing here is real. All sculptures are copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a special gallery with great natural light. The good thing about plaster casts is that sculptures originally shown together but now in different museums across Europe can be seen together again.

The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all over the world and from all geological ages. It also has Britain's oldest geological collection, made by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728), with nearly 10,000 rare specimens in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick, a Professor of Geology, added a lot to the collections, making the museum outstanding. The collection is organized by geological age, showing major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with labels explaining their nature and modern use.

There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection, taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos across Great Britain. The photos are interesting as they show the landscape and human activity from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. The photos cannot be borrowed, but copies can be bought and usually take about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world. It is a unique tourist attraction where you can create wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred brass plates from tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center makes resin copies, called facsimiles, to preserve the originals while allowing people to enjoy brass rubbing. Brass plates were used as memorials instead of statues and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many were destroyed in revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and the Cambridge Centre has a wide range of examples."
CAE_13,C1,"**From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**
I have had 35 years of being around small children because of my unusual personal life. I have loved every moment of it. This morning, I fed the baby, and for me, that is what being a father is all about. I am very lucky with my children. We all love opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up, and I am more of a friend than a father. I don't believe in hitting children. I have slapped my children in anger, but I don't support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here if they need me, but I let them call me. If you start chasing them to ask why they haven't called, you make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do it to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**
I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities difficult. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and clothes. This has been very helpful for running my agency. I have never felt out of touch. When they were young, I was busy starting my business, so I missed some things like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with our friends and come to parties and advertising award ceremonies with us without feeling shy. I think it helps that I do something they find glamorous and interesting.
**C. The Politician**
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more politically active, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if there are facilities for the kids to come with me. This way, they know what I do when I am not with them, and there is no feeling of Daddy disappearing. I've noticed more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all realizing the need to involve our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**
My first marriage ended when Kate and Bonnie were young, so I had to think a lot about being a father. I tried hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even lived next door to each other for a while, so the kids could come and go as they wanted, but I think they found that confusing. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too liberal. I think I could have been more organized. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest. In that way, your kids never leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**
I was ready for kids. I was 30, met my wife, and we had a lovely house. We thought, ""Why keep spending money on new sofas when we could have a kid instead?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me understand who I am. You feel special when you have a child, and you are, but you also become just another parent. It's a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her smile makes it all better. A baby's smile is the best way to make you feel happy. It can melt a grown man."

CAE_46,C1,"Title: 'Science and Weightlessness: A Unique Flight Experience'
Journalist Tom Mumford joined students on a special flight to test their science ideas in weightlessness. From the outside, the plane looked normal. It was a Boeing KC-135, built in 1964, similar to a Boeing 707. But inside, it was different. The plane had a long white tunnel with few windows and lights along the walls. Most seats were removed, except a few at the back where 13 students from Europe and America sat, looking nervous.
For a year, these students competed to join this flight, organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this unusual flight, which felt like a wild roller-coaster ride. For two hours, the plane flew up and down like a giant bird. At the top of each curve, the pilot cut the engines, and the plane went higher on its own before falling back to Earth. During these moments, everything inside the plane became weightless, and the students felt like they were closer to the moon than Earth.
The flight started smoothly, but soon the plane climbed at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and we felt the blood leave our heads. Then, the engines stopped, and we were weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, feeling like we were dancing in the air. Moving around was confusing because directions like up or down no longer made sense.
After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned suddenly, and some students landed hard. There were 30 curves in total, giving ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They used a device to turn it over in the air. A German team from the University of Aachen looked at how metal joins are affected by no gravity, thinking about future space stations. Students from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films in microgravity. They believe these sails could use the sun's energy like a yacht uses the wind.
After two hours of flying up and down, we felt a bit sick, but mostly excited. One student said, 'It was unforgettable. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more.'"
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology."" He talks about a unique time in his life when he didn't experience any summers. He traveled to New Zealand every summer in the UK, which is winter in New Zealand, so he had nine winters in a row. He enjoyed this because he likes winter.
His parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land in New Zealand for him and his siblings to take care of. His mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" This way, they would always have a connection to New Zealand, where their father grew up. They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land wasn't very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.
Jonathon was excited about the idea because he loved working with land. He had spent a year in Australia working on farms, so planting trees sounded great to him. He started planting in 1968, and by 1972, he and his siblings had planted trees on the entire 70 acres.
In 1968, it rained a lot in New Zealand, making it a challenging but happy time for Jonathon. Every morning, he faced the cold and wet weather to plant trees. He worked with an experienced tree-planter, which helped him learn. They used a planting bag to carry trees and had to line up poles to plant in straight lines. Jonathon enjoyed the hard work, and it made him fit. Over time, he developed a rhythm for planting, which made the job easier.
While planting, Jonathon had time to think about life and nature. These thoughts influenced his future work. He has returned to New Zealand four times to see the trees grow, which makes him happy. He worries about bad weather affecting the trees but is glad they are now 20 years old and healthy.
In 1984, Jonathon took a break from teaching and spent three months alone in New Zealand. He wrote his first book, ""Seeing Green,"" in a small cabin on the tree farm. He feels a strong connection to the land and believes it is a powerful bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Caring for Badgers**
""What now?"" I thought when a helper handed me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago. We are known for taking care of orphaned animals. The noise from the box was strange, like a mix between a laugh and a bark. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their fur was soft like velvet, and they had milky-colored eyes on their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between January and March and live underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger and are never found. These three were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. The mother was dead, and the babies were still with her. They were healthy but cold and crying. After removing their fleas, I took them to the kitchen and put them by the stove to warm up. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to mimic their mother licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though unsteadily. They seemed happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute ""mom.""
Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was not as active, even though he was eating normally. This was a warning sign. I didn't act quickly enough, and the next morning, I found him dead. The vet said Willow died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding, it's important not to let the animal drink too fast, as liquid can go into the lungs. This caused an infection in Willow that was hard to treat, even with antibiotics. I was sad about losing Willow but continued caring for the others. Six days later, a local farmer brought me another male cub, abandoned by its mother. The area was too disturbed for her to return, and the cub was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. He was about two weeks younger than the females and very hard to feed. I had to move the bottle's teat around in his mouth to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and other foods. Willow II was different. He liked the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready for other foods.
At nearly five months old, they were eating cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat earthworms, beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and plant shoots or roots. My badgers were lucky because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, the cubs became more active at night and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they played and chased each other. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their games. I learned to avoid their playful bites, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got bitten and bruised. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, as badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive to outsiders. We were warned they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we made the gate more secure with sheet metal.
The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people were interested. We started a project to build a home for the badgers on the farm. With help and advice, we designed a new home for them. Our son Daniel made the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side for people to see inside. As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they stopped going for walks and enjoyed their new home. The building cost more than expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline helped sponsor it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Later, I checked on them and saw three badgers sleeping soundly in their chambers.
These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially since they wake up at midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she has joined a neighboring sett. Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have accepted."
CAE_67,C1,"'In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to map compass changes. Anjana Ahuja reports. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was mapping 'compass variations' during his sea trips on the ship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', are the angle between magnetic north and true north. Without knowing this, sailors couldn't correct their compasses, making it hard to find their exact position at sea. Halley, one of the few people paid to do scientific research at that time, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to map declination in the Atlantic Ocean. The first trip was stopped because of problems with the crew, but Halley tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these trips, Halley published a map in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map was very useful to sailors for over a hundred years until changes in Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate. Dr. Clark, who also loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by following the same route. He needs to raise £70,000 for the trip, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, known for leading the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. 'Halley led an amazing life,' says Dr. Clark. 'He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.' Dr. Clark believes recreating the voyage will give Halley the recognition he deserves. The new expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking the same measurements Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data will help improve the current model of Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field. 'We usually measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. To measure direction, you need to know true north,' says Dr. Clark. 'On our trip, we can use global positioning satellites to find that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill any gaps in the Atlantic Ocean. Halley's journey was the first scientific sea expedition, and he was the first civilian made a naval captain for this purpose. Dr. Clark has the experience needed for this journey. He spent two years in Antarctica and works in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. The expedition will have four stages with different crews. Does Dr. Clark share Halley's passion? 'I am ready to spend eight months on this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't cross the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his life have given me a real sense of purpose.'"
CAE_27,C1,"**POWER DRESSING EVERY SUMMER**
Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tails to the female peahens. This display raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: in a world where animals compete to survive, why do peacocks have such extravagant tails? How do they manage with them?
Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying these peacocks to find answers. Darwin believed that animals evolved through natural selection, meaning the strongest and smartest survive. However, the peacock's tail seemed to be a problem because it is large and not practical. Darwin suggested another idea called 'sexual selection,' where females choose mates based on beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He thought that if peahens chose males with fancy tails, there must be a good reason. Maybe these males had other qualities that helped them survive, even if humans couldn't see them.
Today, the debate continues. At Whipsnade, 200 peacocks live like wild birds but are used to people, making them perfect for study. Petrie and her team are asking two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the showiest tails? And do these males have other advantages, as Wallace thought?
Observations show that peahens do like males with more eye-spots on their tails, which are longer. These males attract more mates. But it's still unclear if these males are better in other ways.
William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free of parasites, which their bright feathers show. This idea is true for some birds, but Petrie's team hasn't tested it on Whipsnade peacocks yet.
This year, Petrie is comparing the children of attractive and unattractive males. Do the children of attractive males grow faster or are they healthier? If yes, then the females' choice is practical, as Wallace thought.
There's another idea from R.A. Fisher, a mathematician and biologist. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will have better tails, and their daughters will prefer long tails. This cycle could make tails longer over time. This idea supports Darwin's thought that females might choose beauty just for beauty's sake."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of modern yachts with new technology. Most of these boats are based on designs from 25 years ago. My boat, however, is different. It sits quietly on a creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it could be 100 years old. Some might think I am a romantic dreamer, but I don't think so. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but modern technology made it easier to build.
Modern technology is important in boat design and building, but it can sometimes make sailing too easy. Many people go to sea to experience the challenges of sailing. I don't think sailors should suffer, but I believe boats should have some basic comforts, like a coal stove for warmth and dry sleeping areas. However, if everything on the boat is automatic, like the sails, it takes away from the experience. A little struggle with the sails is part of being a sailor.
Some boats now have steering positions in the middle, which makes the cabin bigger, like a hotel room. But I think a boat should feel like a boat, not a house. When I bought my old boat, Hirta, the previous owner said it had comfort but no luxury. Hirta had heavy sails, no electric water pump, no fridge, no central heating, and no electronics, but it was the best boat I ever sailed.
Old boats need a lot of care. After I hurt my back, I had to sell Hirta. I couldn't find a new boat I liked, so I decided to build one. The Westerman has been perfect for me. The designer, Nigel Irens, first drew the boat on a napkin, then used a computer to finish the design. We made a model of the boat, like in the old days, and then improved the design on the computer. The final boat was perfect.
The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. It looks timeless, sails smoothly, and feels peaceful inside. This is because it was designed as a sailing boat first, without thinking about furniture. This traditional method works well. The boat is made of wood treated with a special glue, so it doesn't let water in. It has the benefits of a modern boat but looks and feels like a classic one."

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**
I was happy to visit Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I joined many classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors are very good, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, and facials. The staff are friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to add a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or take a walk in the garden. I left feeling great and full of energy. This is a perfect place for a stressed working woman. I want to visit again! - Marcella D'Argy Smith
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**
Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. It has a beautiful library and a conservatory. When you arrive, you get a medical check-up. They call everyone ""patients,"" which was strange for me because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem during my check-up and helped me with it in fitness classes. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry and got a headache on the second day. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit with yogurt. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. The extra treatments are not too expensive. - Liz Gregory

CAE_22,C1,"**Natural Talents**
In the last seven million years, humans have become different from chimpanzees, but not by much. We are still more than 98% the same as chimps in our genes. This means that what makes us different from animals is a recent change. Our ability to make art and do other human things comes from a small part of our genes. Because of this, scientists have found that many things we thought were only human are also done by animals, just in different ways. For example, chimpanzees use sticks as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have simple language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'.
The first human art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we can't find these because they don't last over time. The first clear human art we know of is from the Cro-Magnons, about 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
People say human art is different because it is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinctive. Let's look at these ideas:
1. **Not Useful**: Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means art doesn't help us survive or have children, unlike most animal behaviors. For example, birds sing to defend their area or find a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. Human art seems different because it doesn't do this.
2. **Made for Beauty**: Human art is often made for enjoyment. We can't ask birds if they like their songs, but they mostly sing during mating season, so they probably don't sing just for fun. This makes human art seem unique.
3. **Learned, Not Instinctive**: Human art styles are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are different, but people can learn each other's songs. Some birds, however, are born knowing their species' song. It's like a French baby raised in Japan suddenly singing the French national anthem without learning it.
Human art changes quickly. Geese honked 2,000 years ago and still do today, but human art changes so fast that even a casual museum visitor can tell a 20th-century painting from the Mona Lisa. Experts can often tell who painted a work and when. However, two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, painted works that looked like human abstract art. Congo even made 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in a London art exhibit in 1957, and many were sold, which some human artists can't say.
These chimp paintings blur the line between human art and animal activities. Like human art, they were not made for practical reasons but for the painter's satisfaction. Some might say human art is different because it is meant to communicate, but even some famous human art was made just for the artist's own pleasure."
CAE_39,C1,"Title: A Big Adventure
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on earth that people have not explored much. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived to tell his story. 
There are not many big adventures or heroes left today. In the past, children's stories often had brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance. Nowadays, you don't see such people in stories or real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore led a team across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored places on earth. The desert's name means 'once entered you never come out', and locals call it the Desert of Death. He talked about the dangers and excitement of the journey at his home. His team included four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. However, the camel handlers were actually truck drivers, which was a mistake that could have been very dangerous.
This group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a book about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He started the expedition for fun and to find out more about himself. 'I always thought I'd stay in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I wanted to see who I was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was worried because nobody had done that route before. We went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross, and the desert was kind to us.'
The team faced many hardships: illness, extreme temperatures, thirst, and losing some of their water. 'But', Blackmore says, 'when we were at our limits and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some. We didn't face the desert's famous sandstorms or the cold that could have stopped us. But we had many challenges. The sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and the camels, which sometimes fell on us.'
'What kept me going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. No planes flew over us. Once in the sandhills, we were on our own. I knew I had the mental strength, but I was scared about my physical ability. On the first day, sitting at the desert's edge, it was so hot I couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We have to do it now!"" I was very scared.'
Towards the end, he said, 'After walking 1,000 kilometers, you don't give up. We were very thin but strong. My body was fit, and my legs were like machines. I could walk over anything.'
In the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking at the moon, and thinking of his family. He says, 'Inside me, there's someone trying to find peace. When I doubt myself, I remember the desert and think, we did it. I'm prouder of that expedition than anything else. But in life, my family and our happiness are more important.'
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I miss the challenge and open spaces. We had a strong sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life.'"

Susan started to let her household gadgets go as they stopped working. She wondered what ""extra time"" technology really gives us. Is it just time to buy more gadgets? She thinks we are being tricked by marketing experts. When her sewing machine started making strange noises, she left it in the backyard. Now, she enjoys sewing by hand, which is quieter and more relaxing. She can take her sewing anywhere in a bag.
There are some gadgets Susan still values, like the washing machine. But getting rid of others, like the color TV, brought unexpected happiness. Without the TV, her family spends more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing hobbies. Susan enjoys sewing by hand, even though she used to think it was hard work. She finds it soothing and satisfying to see her work improve.
Sewing by hand allows Susan to listen to the radio or talk with family and friends. She can also watch TV while sewing, feeling less guilty about sitting in front of the screen.

He always has many orders, even though he doesn't advertise. People know that if they want good furniture, Hurst is the person to go to.
Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding someone like Hurst, who makes simple and well-crafted pieces, is rare. Hurst is not happy with some modern furniture because it is often poorly made. He does not like mass-produced furniture and believes in making high-quality pieces.

Hurst learned his craft by asking questions and teaching himself. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return to him for more furniture. He finds it satisfying to furnish a whole house. However, he admits that working with clients can sometimes be difficult, especially if they are unsure of what they want. He prefers clients who know exactly what they want.
Hurst appreciates other talented craftsmen and admits there are people better than him.

But, scientists still do not fully agree on why we need to sleep so much. There are three main ideas. The first and most popular idea is that sleep is important for our body. It says that we sleep to keep our body healthy. While we sleep, our body fixes any damage from the day and makes us ready for the next day. The second idea is about learning. It says that sleep helps us understand and remember what we learn during the day. Without sleep, we would not learn well. The third idea is about energy. It says that we need sleep to recharge, like charging a battery, so we have enough energy for the next day.'"
CAE_31,C1,"**Eccentrics**
An eccentric is someone who behaves differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing angry letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is about being unique. Inside us, there is a struggle between wanting to be different and wanting to fit in. It's like having two trains pushing against each other on the same track. One train is called individualism, and the other is conformity. For most people, conformity is stronger. We want to be accepted, loved, and feel like we belong. This is stronger than wanting to stand out and be different.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find others like them. They form clubs, have meetings, and organize events to share their interests. They look for people who understand them, as their family and friends might think they are odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, feels comforting.
We all feel a pull between being unique and fitting in. We might follow the crowd but still want to show we are different. For example, someone might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me."" We can choose to be more individualistic and show our personality. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, an American singer, said, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then pursue it, don't back down and don't give up.""
However, being different on purpose is not the same as being eccentric. If a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention or a hostess makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these actions until they become a natural part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric. True eccentricity is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care about what others think. They do what they do because of who they are.
This makes eccentrics different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of the world and react to it. Some want to impress society, and some want to escape it, but they are aware of it. Eccentrics, however, continue on their own path without worrying about society."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four nature experts to share the wildlife book that influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I've met many important people in this field. None impressed me more than Barbara Ward, a small but strong woman. She was central to environmental issues in post-war Europe. Her book, *The Home of Man*, is about the rapid growth of cities and the need for sustainable development. It is the most important book I've read on this topic.
**B. Linda Bennett**
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can imagine the sounds and smells of a herring gull colony. This book explains how animals communicate. After reading it, watching a gull colony becomes fascinating. You can see how they interact and recognize family groups. Niko Tinbergen, a famous behaviorist, worked with wildlife artist Eric Ennion to create this book. Ennion's paintings show the behavior of gulls with just a few lines and colors. This book is perfect for anyone who loves wildlife.
**C. Lee Durrell**
*My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell is the book that changed my life. It led me to my husband and a career in conservation. I first read it while researching animal sounds in Madagascar. The book lifted my spirits during tough times. It shows a world where animals and people are joyfully connected. Many criticize humans for harming nature, but Gerald Durrell saw all living things as a family. This idea is important for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**
I found *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library in 1966. I was drawn to the beautiful bird paintings by Eric Ennion. I already loved birdwatching and had other bird books, but this one was special. It included information on bird migration, history, and birds in art and music. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature was just as important as a scientific one. Since I was better at art than science, this book opened new possibilities for me."
CAE_37,C1,"Title: Do Reviews Help Sell Books?
We asked five top British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said:
Publisher A: Reviews are very important for publishers. Many people buy books because of reviews more than ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers both dislike getting no reviews, but publishers are less upset by bad reviews. They think any review can help sell books because people want to decide for themselves. Publishers like reviews that match their own thoughts about a book.
Publisher B: Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain readers, while publishers want their books reviewed positively. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but paperbacks are often ignored. Reviews help make books and authors known. A good review by a trusted person can increase sales.
Publisher C: Reviews are very important for literary publishers. They help sell books, especially for authors who are not famous. Good reviews are more valuable than ads because they are seen as honest opinions. Reviews can help launch a book and a career, but they need help from other things like word of mouth and good marketing.
Publisher D: In the US, a review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, reviews don't always have a big impact. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a writer. Some poorly reviewed books sell very well. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer's knowledge than the book itself.
Publisher E: Publishers and writers want long, positive reviews, but they don't always sell books. I once published a biography with great reviews, but it didn't sell well because people felt they didn't need to buy it after reading the reviews. The reviewer's name used to matter more, but now it's the review's style or surprise choice of reviewer that can attract buyers."
CAE_2,C1,"Making weathervanes is a very old skill, starting from early Egyptian times. Today, Graham Smith keeps this craft alive in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who make weathervanes by hand. Graham creates special designs for each customer. 'This way, I can make a unique and personal item,' he says. 'Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's work or hobbies.' This is different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common weathervane. Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick, which he made as a surprise gift for his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. 'I realized there are endless ideas for weathervanes,' he says. Graham decided to focus on a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. 'My old job wasn't artistic, but this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I love the design part.' Graham has now made over 100 original designs. He works with great detail and always gets the customer's approval before cutting the design by hand. Graham also keeps many traditional designs because they are popular too. 'People like hand-made things,' Graham says. 'They like to have something a bit different.' Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. 'I have found my place in the market. People love the unique items, and I enjoy turning a simple shape into something almost lifelike,' he says. 'For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction,' he explains. 'Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.' Graham is now very busy, sending flat-packed weathervanes to clients all over the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. 'The price,' he explains, 'depends on how detailed the design is.' His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,C1,"Title: Beginner Takes All
Before it was even published, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about what inspired him and his success.
At the start of the year, things were not going well for Nicholas Evans. He is a screenwriter, producer, and wants to be a director. His year started badly when a film project called ""Life and Limb,"" which he had worked on for months, suddenly failed. He was worried because he hadn't earned any money for two years, and this film was his only hope to pay the bank. A sensible person might have looked for a job, like going back to being a TV executive. But instead, Evans made a bold decision. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.
The idea for the story came from a farrier he met on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. Its owners were desperate until they found a gypsy who calmed the horse just by talking to it. These men were called ""horse whisperers."" Evans was fascinated and started researching to write a screenplay. But after ""Life and Limb"" failed, he decided to write a book instead.
In the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his future. By August, he had written half of the book and was back home. The bank was pressuring him, so he showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent thought it was ""fine"" and said Evans might get $30,000 for it. Evans needed more money to pay his debts and support his family, but he decided to keep writing.
In October, he sent the first 200 pages and a 12-page summary to seven UK publishers before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. The book was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for $550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. They were amazed by the offers, and even Hollywood studios wanted the rights to make a movie.
Evans decided not to write the screenplay for ""The Horse Whisperer"" because he didn't want to spoil the fairy tale-like success. He wanted to stay involved but not be controlled by the film studios. The success of his book also brought new interest in ""Life and Limb,"" but he wasn't sure he wanted to make it anymore. He thought it would be wise to write another novel."
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Masters Bobby Fischer is trying to prove himself again in the world of chess. Chess is now more popular with young players. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer is back and playing against Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game with a great performance, but he is not the same as he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, not in practice, and not in shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess more popular, and now it is more professional. Winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as important as their intelligence. The game is very intense: players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose. Now, games last longer, and many are played without breaks. This makes it easier for younger players to succeed. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the one before. Of the world's top ten players, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Players must prepare well before matches, especially because computers have changed chess a lot. A small computer can store one million chess games and help players study their opponents. In one match, both players had teams working to find weaknesses in each other's games. The opening moves of a game are now studied very carefully. Being well-prepared in the opening can decide the game. Today, there are more top players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prize money around the world. Success requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. Losing concentration can lead to disaster. The chess clock adds to the pressure. The end of the game can be a fast 'time scramble', where players have only seconds to make moves. This is not a time for deep thinking. It becomes a battle of nerves and determination. At the top level, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to rest. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to play again the next day. Most tournaments last 9-11 days, with games every day. World championship matches are even tougher. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to stop because both players were too tired. Karpov lost about 10kg in weight. Can Fischer succeed against these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made his leaving the chess world in 1972 surprising. But it also made him a legend. If he returned for money, he will earn a lot. Whatever happens in his match with Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Fischer returned to prove he is still the best, losing could be very disappointing.'"

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A. Nick Grosso**
Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, ""Peaches,"" into a movie script. ""It's a low-budget film, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be more than £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Before writing ""Peaches,"" Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I wouldn't do that now because I know it's difficult. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational environment. It was very exciting.""
**B. Simon Pegg**
Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comedy team Funny Business, but working with Steve Coogan has been the most rewarding. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably saw me copying him,"" Simon admits.
**C. Ciaran McMenamin**
Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became famous when he starred in the series ""The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star."" The show was well-received, and his career took off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare position, especially since he just graduated. Looking at Ciaran's early career, it's clear he was always going to be successful. Encouraged by his mother, he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I used acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided to take it seriously because I was good at it and loved it."" Now he is waiting for more praise, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for good work.""
**D. Neil Taylor**
Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single ""Chimera"" is released. ""The record company talks about a big hit, but I don't know. If two people buy it, I'll be happy,"" he says. Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, and I've been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E. Stephen Richards**
Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many prizes and awards. He is well-known in the poetry world and has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, ""Hidden,"" will be published in March. ""It's a story of obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express in a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing at school but became unhappy with education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but when I got bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre, I decided to go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer. They thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry being praised, moving to novels is brave. ""There's a structure in my poetry, so there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more chances for mistakes. My main goal is not to just produce work without caring about quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this funny novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but doesn't wear them often because she doesn't want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance books and is looking for the perfect partner. She worries that her knees might stop her from finding love. But she always stays hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with a lot of energy, like an old silent movie, with exciting chapter titles like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired.'
B. This story is about the start and almost end of a local radio station in America. It is told from the view of a smart child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon features a mix of singers, preachers, and soap-opera stars. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing. The story takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old stores, cars, and radios.
C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. Professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poet, and he talks about it with his wife's ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother, who is in prison. The author makes these problems interesting and funny, and the story is enjoyable and clever.
D. Two pairs of best friends, two women and two men, meet in London in the 1960s and stay connected for 25 years. At the start of this long novel, one of them, an American businessman named James Hudson, is starting a newspaper, and his friend Richard Blake is the editor. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved, and one of them married, was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is very good. This book is long and detailed, allowing readers to really get to know the characters.
E. This story, written by a great American author, is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty for something he did and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, Ian is becoming an unusual bachelor, surrounded by the mess of family life. The story explores many emotions and focuses on the sweet relationship Ian builds with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and lovely book with a perfect mix of sadness and humor."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism: A Discussion**
**A.** Volunteer tourism is when people travel to help build homes or schools in other countries. However, they often pay a lot of money to do this. If this money was given directly to the local community, it might help more than the work the volunteer can do. This is especially true for young people on gap years, who may not have the skills needed. Some studies question if these volunteers are really trying to help or if they just want to improve their own careers. But, these projects can help volunteers learn to act ethically and support those who are less fortunate.
**B.** Volunteering can help people understand each other better, solve conflicts, and participate in global issues. It can also create international friendships. This can be good for both volunteers and the communities they help. However, if only rich people from wealthy countries volunteer, it might only help them and not the communities. These volunteers might use the experience to advance their own careers, rather than truly helping the local people.
**C.** Sometimes, international volunteering can seem like charity from rich countries or a way for volunteers to improve themselves. But it can also be a way to share skills and knowledge between cultures. Volunteering can make people aware of global issues like poverty and injustice, and encourage them to work against these problems for life.
**D.** Volunteer tourism is popular because it seems like a simple way to help others. It avoids big government and business, focusing on personal acts of charity. However, it can also ignore the bigger political issues and reduce development to small acts of kindness. While volunteering is a good thing, it should not replace real efforts to understand and solve global inequalities and poverty."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm: Stuart Harris Reports**
Many people listen to the radio when they wake up and need something to help them get out of bed. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, including me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different models.
One model has a 'dual alarm function.' I thought it meant you could snooze and then wake up again, but it actually lets you set two different wake-up times, like one for weekdays and one for weekends. This model also has a cassette player, which is nice because you can listen to your own tapes. The radio quality is great, but it's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also books a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn't work. This model was the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges loved it, even though the clock sometimes got stuck at 16:00. The digital display is nice, and the snooze bar is easy to use. It has a backup power feature, so you don't have to reset it if the power goes out. However, it was hard to set up, but once we learned how, we felt 'cool' and sophisticated.
Another model has a built-in lamp, but Tom Granger thought it was poorly made. You have to pull the light out of its socket to use it, which made him question its quality. The clock was hard to set, and the light only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but found the radio hard to tune. The buzzer is loud and annoying, like an alarm on a submarine. Despite this, it's the third most popular model on the market.
A model aimed at young people has a bright design and a bootlace strap. Tom Granger and I liked it because it stands out. It was the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be off by 10 minutes, which Paul Bridges found unacceptable.
The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said it was easier to set up than modern push-button tuning. The radio quality was fine, and the buzzer worked well, waking me up in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not originally from America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened. This makes their spines stick out to protect them. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines because they need to be lighter. These hedgehogs might try to run away from danger first and only roll into a ball if they have no other choice.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They usually sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, which means they sleep through the winter, but not all of them do. If the weather is good, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sports Women on a Winning Streak**
Being successful in sports is difficult for everyone, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competitions take up a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming obstacles and setting new records. Here, we talk to some talented British sportswomen who are achieving their dreams.
**A. Jill, 27, Skier**
""I love the feeling of flying through the air and landing perfectly, but it can be scary. Sometimes the weather is bad, but you just have to keep going. We train for ten months a year, so it's hard to have a job outside skiing. You miss out on social life and friends, but I chose this path. In the British team, there are six men and three women. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally. It's a young sport.""
**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won because I was the fastest, even though I had never cycled before! I earn well as a professional, and there are opportunities for sponsorships. But I worry people think I succeed because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling now. I train at least four hours every day, plus stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the time commitment.""
**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**
""Rowing is hard for girls to start because few girls' schools offer it. Most start at 19 or 20, making it tough to succeed internationally. Coaches often stay for only a year, so there's little consistency, and the women's team is disorganized. But it's fun, I love being fit, and there's a good social life.""
**D. Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**
""At 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not knowing how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe. I was stubborn and didn't like others controlling me. Now, I'm more tactful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the hardest due to pain. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters, but I got the record! I had to, as my sponsorship money was running out. Men often think women will fail, so sponsoring them is seen as risky.""
**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**
""Some men have big egos when driving. If I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its challenges. At corners, men think 'I must beat her,' so I've had many bumps! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It's hard to earn money, and what I make goes back into racing. Women have raced since the 1920s and were seen as unusual. Now, more women are racing each year. I love aiming for the perfect lap in saloon car racing.""
**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There's a lot of nervous energy before races, and you push yourself hard. I've asked myself why I do it. The reasons are: a) I'm happier when fit, b) I'm lazy at heart and need to push myself, c) racing is social. Men and women usually compete together, but media coverage focuses mostly on men. Prize money isn't as good for women, but we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission to improve this."""
CAE_34,C1,"Title: The Day I Met Picasso
Richard Cork remembers meeting the famous artist Picasso when he was 18 years old. Even from far away, Picasso was easy to recognize while he was eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. Richard was traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van before starting university. He had run out of money and found a job painting boats. He loved drawing and had a sketchbook with him when he met Picasso.
Picasso was usually a private person who worked alone in the hills, so Richard was surprised to see him at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Richard's friend encouraged him to ask Picasso for his autograph. Nervously, Richard introduced himself and offered his sketchbook. Picasso kindly signed his name and added a playful drawing on the page.
Richard was very happy and started a conversation with Picasso. Since Picasso's English was not good and Richard's French was also poor, an American woman at the table helped them talk. She called Picasso ""the Maestro"" and was very excited. Richard told Picasso about his love for art and his admiration for Picasso's work.
After showing his friend the autograph, his friend suggested that Richard should try to draw Picasso's portrait. Richard went back to Picasso's table and started drawing without asking for permission. Picasso noticed and made funny faces to make it difficult for Richard. He acted like a clown, but Richard kept drawing. Eventually, Picasso stopped moving and let Richard study him quietly. Richard noticed how strong and young Picasso looked, even though he was almost 84 years old.
When Richard finished, the American woman said Picasso wanted to see the portrait. Richard was embarrassed but showed it to him. Picasso liked it and decided to draw Richard in return. In a few quick strokes, Picasso drew a playful version of Richard's face. Richard was amazed and asked Picasso to sign the drawing, but Picasso said he had already given his signature.
Richard felt very lucky to have met Picasso and received his attention. It was a special moment that meant a lot to him."
CAE_12,C1,"**Talking Shop: How Stores Make You Spend More**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use many tricks to make you spend more money. Here are some of them:
**A. Freshness Image**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store look fresh. They might also have a bakery inside, so the smell of fresh bread fills the air. The store might use green colors because people think of fresh food when they see green. Most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh, but the fresh image helps sell everything.
**B. Smart Display**  
Where products are placed in a store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out which parts of the store people visit most. They put the most expensive or fast-selling products there. Shelves at eye level are popular because people notice them first. Special offers in big bins attract people who love bargains. Stores also place related items together, like salad dressings near salads.
**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets put basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, you have to walk past other tempting products. Stores with a good reputation for certain products put them far from the entrance too, hoping you will see other things you want to buy.
**D. Less is More**  
Some stores, like Next, show fewer items on their shelves to make them look special. This makes people think the clothes are exclusive, even though they are mass-produced like other brands. The store's design helps sell the clothes.
**E. Total Temptation**  
People care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items, so not everything is a bargain. They might sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as 'loss leaders.' They also buy in large quantities to get discounts from manufacturers.
**F. Price Tricks**  
In chain stores, people buy fewer items and notice prices more. Pricing something at $14.99 instead of $15 makes a difference. It also helps reduce theft because staff have to ring up the sale to give change.
**G. Lighting Effects**  
Stores use lighting carefully. Chain stores try to use natural light so clothes look the same as they would outside. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh food look better.
**H. Walking Paths**  
Some stores use different carpets to guide you through the store. These paths are called the 'Yellow Brick Road.' Not all shoppers follow them, so stores like Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths and carpet for sales areas to encourage people to explore.
**I. In-Store Promotions**  
When you enter a supermarket, you might see big pictures of delicious food. In the U.S., some supermarkets use 'video trolleys' with screens that show ads as you shop. These ads are triggered by sensors and aim to make you buy on impulse. The makers say these trolleys increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"Chris Bonnington, a 58-year-old mountaineer, is famous for climbing Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and written books like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way."" Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. Chris and Robin teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about it in their book ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""
In 1979, while working on ""Quest for Adventure,"" Chris called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail, where Chris could teach him climbing, and Robin could teach Chris sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed, anchored, and then went to shore to climb. Chris was impressed by Robin's calmness in difficult climbing conditions. Robin had never climbed before, so Chris showed him how. Robin then used his own method to climb down safely.
During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a bigger version of their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin's leadership. Robin, as the skipper, usually made decisions but always asked for everyone's opinion first. Chris found sailing boring and preferred being on land, while Robin enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin didn't really need his help.
The yacht was small, with six people on board, making it crowded. In Greenland, when it was Chris's turn to lead, he found it hard to be responsible for Robin's safety while climbing. Climbing Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, was tough. Robin wasn't a natural climber, but he did well. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours but had to turn back. Robin trusted Chris completely and was willing to try again.
The only time they almost had a problem was on the way home. Chris was supposed to take a turn watching the boat at 4 am, but Robin didn't wake him up, thinking he could handle it alone. Chris felt Robin didn't trust him, but Robin reassured him it was a misunderstanding. By the end of the Greenland trip, Chris realized that Robin, despite his tough exterior, was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been with us for a very long time, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. But in the late 20th century, we risk losing this variety. 
**Prehistoric Apples (8,000 BC)**
People have been eating apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, they spat out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, people in Switzerland and Italy left apple remains near their homes. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored dried apple halves for winter. These were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we know today.
**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and this knowledge was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apples, but most didn't grow well in Britain. The Normans brought better varieties, and British monks developed new apples. Many Western apples come from these varieties.
**Medieval Favorites (1200)**
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known since 1204, was a main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296. But due to droughts, the Black Death, and wars, fewer apples were grown, and more were imported. In the 16th century, Henry VIII sent Richard Harris to France to learn about apple growing. Harris brought back many apple types, including the famous Pippins, and started a modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Treasure (1750)**
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was known for his love of apple trees and his kindness.
**Modern Delicious (1850)**
Around this time in Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge called it 'Delicious', and in 1895, it became one of the most popular apples in the world.
**Granny Smith (1850)**
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was known as 'Granny Smith' and found a new apple tree in 1868. This tree produced the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. She said, ""It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her own background.
**Uniformity (1950)**
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from India to Africa. Most are grown commercially and come from just a few varieties, chosen for their looks or ability to travel, not taste. This lack of variety is a problem. While some gardeners in the UK keep old apple types alive, the US has lost many apples from 100 years ago. Consumers now want more variety. We need to protect the diversity of apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar, a top British long-distance runner, visited a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. This camp is located in Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya, which is covered in glaciers. For three years, Richard trained in Kenya's Central Highlands during winter, but he never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until his fourth visit. During this trip, he competed in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in a World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. 
Training at high altitudes helps runners because it increases red blood cells, improving how the body uses oxygen. This is one reason why Kenyan runners are so successful. Richard's first race in Africa was an international cross-country race in Nairobi. Although 41 runners finished ahead of him, most were Kenyan, and he felt he had run well.
Kenyan runners are known for their simple approach to running. They have an easy running style, a simple diet, and a relaxed way of talking. They also love to compete. Richard wanted to understand how they train, so he stayed at the national team training camp at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. The camp is basic, with athletes living in simple dormitories. 
The athletes' day includes three workouts: an easy morning run, interval training in the mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple, with basic meals like tea, bread, boiled eggs, ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers.
Richard left the camp with a greater appreciation for Kenyan runners. He realized their success is not just due to genetics, upbringing, or altitude. The simple lifestyle, hard training, and passion for success are key reasons for Kenya's success in distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"**Hit and Miss of Mass Marketing**
Advertising is having a tough time. It's not just because of the recession. Advertising started to drop in 1989, even before the recession got serious. The problems with advertising are deeper and happening all over the world. Advertising hasn't kept up with how the economy is changing. Advertisers think about big markets and big media, but as more brands and media appear, target markets have become smaller. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they often don't. This is where advertising has gone wrong.
Think about your shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30 to 50 items. Many of these won't be advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 items in the store. Over a year, you probably buy only a few hundred brands. For things like cars, you might buy one every three years, and it might be from your employer. You don't buy many clothes either, and most aren't advertised brands. Even with things like candy, medicine, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands a year.
Compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. Let's focus on the 9,500 brands that spend more on advertising. The average person buys 400 of those 9,500, and not all because of advertising. That's about 4 percent. So, 96 percent of advertising might be wasted, but nobody knows which part. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 ads, or 6 percent. The other 94 percent seem wasted.
You might think you're not affected by advertising, but almost everyone thinks that. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is part of using media for advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the rest, so waste can't be avoided. But advertising can still be cost-effective. It reaches many people to find the few who will respond. Media advertising works because it's a cheap way to communicate with many people.
With smart targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond. But they can never know exactly who will respond. Even the best direct mail doesn't get a 100 percent response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every client. With media, this can't happen. If advertisers knew who would respond, they wouldn't need media. They could contact people directly.
Any advertiser who gets one million new customers (2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For soap powder, the top brands would be happy with a million extra customers. Any campaign that wins over 2 percent of the population is very successful. To succeed, advertising needs to target its message more carefully than before."
CAE_43,C1,"Title: Britain's Greenest Home
Charles Clover visits Britain's most environmentally-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This town has two surprises: the ancient Southwell Minster with its 'green' men carvings, and the 'autonomous house' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales' house uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into garden compost, and heats the home with waste heat from appliances and body heat from the family and their two cats. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and fits well with the town's old buildings. It even got approval from planners in a conservation area.
The house is very quiet because it is super-insulated with special windows. Inside, it feels peaceful. On a sunny day, the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens windows and ventilation shafts to let in fresh air because the house is very draught-proof. Even the cats have their own special door.
The Vales, who teach architecture, have been interested in the environment for a long time. They wrote a book called ""The Autonomous House"" in the 1970s. They wanted to create a house that doesn't harm the environment. They designed it to not use mains water and to have no carbon dioxide emissions. They use rainwater tanks, special toilets, and copper gutters to keep the water clean. They don't use a dishwasher because they don't want to use strong detergents.
The house is not medieval, but it has a tall hall with a hearth and staircase. The Vales pay no water bills and use very little electricity. They plan to add solar panels to generate even more electricity, enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove, which they rarely use.
In winter, the house stays warm without much heating. Robert says the temperature feels comfortable because there are no draughts and everything is the same temperature. He suggests that people in old houses should live like people did in the past, but this idea might not be popular.
The house is simple and low-tech, with materials from local builders. It was cheap to build, costing the same as low-cost housing. However, commercial builders are not interested in this idea."
CAE_51,C1,"'The camera never lies Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a logical man, like a scientist. But in 1920, when he saw photos of fairies in a garden, he believed they were real proof that fairies existed. He published the photos with an article he wrote, saying fairies were amazing supernatural beings. It wasn't until 1939 that the two women who took the photos admitted they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are very beautiful. But the simple trick shows that a basic idea about photography, that the camera cannot lie, is not true. Cameras can lie, and they always could. Today, we use computer software to change our digital photos, and it is not true that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the start, when cameras began capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"'Blacksmiths Iron has always been important to people, and blacksmiths, the people who work with iron, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The flowing metal designs of French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were also made by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s in Britain, blacksmiths were almost gone because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern buildings rarely used elegant wrought-iron designs. In the past 10 years, there has been a revival because people are more interested in decorative architecture and creative interior design. Still, much of the work looks old-fashioned, with gates and balconies often described as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. Many design stores sell rusty candlesticks with decorations. Fortunately, there are new options, and events are being held to promote blacksmithing. One event is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA) at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, says we might be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently. Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it easily. 'Now,' says Dawson, 'these artists can express themselves with metal.' About 250 pieces are in the show, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go much higher. Most money goes to the makers, but some supports good ironwork, says Dawson. His own works include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. 'My style comes from letting steel bend and flow when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,' he says. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals, which are easy to shape when cold, iron and steel are tougher. Susan May, a jeweler, says, 'It's magical because it's soft when hot but becomes hard when it cools.' Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles inspired by castles in horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'It feels like it will last forever.' Iron has given people visual pleasure and a sense of security. It will likely be used decoratively for many years, as long as we avoid more rusty candlesticks.'"
CAE_14,C1,"Title: The Day I Quit Smoking
I thought everyone would be happy when I quit smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She said, ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I couldn't really explain how I went from smoking a pack a day to not smoking at all in just four hours. It even surprised me. 
I attended a stop-smoking session that combined group therapy and hypnotherapy. This happened exactly two months and three weeks ago. I didn't plan to quit smoking, and I didn't really want to. I was annoyed by the pressure from people who were against smoking. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick and seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.
On a regular Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking in Birmingham to write an article about others trying to quit. I told them, ""I won't try to stop myself because I'm here to write, not to quit."" I thought I was being fair. I actually enjoyed smoking; it made me happy. The counselor seemed to understand something I didn't.
We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't really want to, and neither did the others. The messages about quitting made sense to me. Just like smoking was a challenge because people were against it, quitting started to feel like a good idea. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling, just for me.
In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical craving for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and only lasted for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn't a problem at all. I believed I needed nicotine to meet deadlines, but I was wrong. Surprisingly, spending weekend mornings at home was the hardest part, and it still is. I think smoking was a way to avoid boredom; having a cigarette was something to do.
Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each new experience as a non-smoker is different, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These were all times when I used to smoke."
CAE_63,C1,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but not many people in Britain know her name. Georgina Ferry, who is writing Hodgkin's biography, has noticed this. When she tells people about her work, only a few recognize Hodgkin's name. 
Hodgkin was an amazing person. She won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for her work on penicillin and vitamin B12. Later, in 1969, she also solved the structure of insulin. Her work was very important and difficult, but she also had a family. She had three children and a husband who was often away because he was a historian. 
In the past, scientific biographies were often boring and only focused on the scientist's work. They didn't talk much about their personal lives. But now, things are changing. Books about scientists like Richard Feynman, Isaac Newton, and Albert Einstein show their personal sides too. This makes them more interesting to readers.
Some people think scientists' lives are not as exciting as those of artists or writers. But this is not true. Scientists can have interesting lives too. For example, some scientists now appear on TV shows or in advertisements, which helps people see them as real people.
Understanding science can be challenging, but it's not harder than learning a new language or reading Shakespeare. It's important to know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin because they have made great contributions to our world."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Special Skill
Margaret Wilkins has a special ability called a 'sixth sense'. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time.
This skill, called dowsing, helps find water, minerals, and lost objects underground. People have different ideas about how it works. Some think it is about magnetism, while others think it is spiritual. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Dowsers, like Margaret, might be very good at feeling these vibrations. Some say they can 'sense' or even smell water.
In recent years, there have been many droughts, so Margaret has been very busy. At one point, people had to wait almost six weeks for her help. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She also helps people with holiday homes far from water pipes and golf-course developers who need water for clubhouses.
Margaret looks for water 50 to 70 meters deep. She makes sure the water is clean and not near any waste. The water she finds is in cracks of hard rock. It is important to have electricity nearby to run the water pump, so she tries to find water close to power supplies.
To start, Margaret uses a map and a pendulum on large areas like golf courses. She moves the pendulum over the map, and it swings when there is water below. Then, she walks over the land with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. The stick moves up when water is directly below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick shows, or they might miss the water.
Margaret's husband also checks the area with his stick. They usually agree on where to drill. If they don't agree, they keep looking until they do.
Margaret's skill is not just an old tradition. Many people are interested in how she does it. She calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment'. This means she has a natural understanding of where water is. Without this skill, her family could not run their well-drilling business successfully."

Have you ever thought about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to try something different? We arranged this for four people. Read about their experiences.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda, a 23-year-old mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.
Amanda had never been in a place like the restaurant before. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. She was not sure she would manage! Being a mother is busy, but this was different. She had only 15 minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but Amanda dropped the drinks, and they spilled everywhere. She was embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said everyone makes mistakes at first.
By 11:30 am, there was already a line of people waiting to get in, and Amanda felt nervous. She worried about remembering orders, but everything was automated, so it was not a problem. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she was not used to the loud music. She had to keep saying ""Pardon?"" to customers, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was very tired and wanted to soak her feet in hot water. She was surprised when a waitress said it had been a ""quiet"" day. Amanda realized waitressing is tiring and not as easy as she thought. She was glad to return to her children, which seemed easier after waitressing.
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy was nervous but excited to be a ""mum"" for the day. She knew the girls could be cheeky but thought she could handle it. She was wrong! After Amanda left for work, Cindy had to dress and feed the girls. She dropped Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, thinking she would have three hours of peace. But Amanda left a note with chores like making beds, cleaning, and doing laundry.
At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then home for lunch. When Sophie came home, the real trouble started. The girls turned the sofa into a trampoline and screamed loudly. Cindy thought they would get tired, but they didn't. She managed to get them to bed by 8 pm, but they kept asking for water to stay up and watch TV. Cindy found it exhausting to look after two small children. She didn't have a moment for herself, and the responsibility was overwhelming. Still, she enjoyed the day.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary, 42, runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary, 30, a primary school teacher.
On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping until 7 was a treat. She worried about what to wear to school. At assembly, she hoped to blend in with the 400 pupils. In a maths class, children worked in groups, which was different from her school days. She helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but found teachers only have five minutes to eat. She attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson and a French lesson, where children practiced on her rusty French. Finally, there was Physical Education. Rosemary was exhausted, but the children had lots of energy. She found speaking in front of the class hard. Even though teachers have more holidays, she prefers farming.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, surprised that Rosemary had been up for three hours. The farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 ewes. Rosemary also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell. Hilary spent the morning in the ice cream parlour, bottling milk and packing ice cream. It was hard not to taste the treats!
At lunchtime, Hilary checked the sheep. She picked up a ewe that had fallen over because sheep can die if left for more than 12 hours. After feeding the calves, she started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year. Hilary found the day lonely and missed the children. The hardest part of farming is not being able to take time off. Rosemary only gets about three days' holiday a year. Farming seems romantic, but it is hard work, and the income is not steady."
CAE_6,C1,"'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It's interesting how many musicians come from homes without music. Hakan Hardenberger, from southern Sweden, is one of them. At 30, he is a famous trumpet player, even though his parents were not musical. His records include both old and new music. When you meet him, he seems young and friendly, like the sound of his trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London, and a TV show talked about his work and life, filmed in both London and Sweden.
Hakan was born near Malmo. His career started because of a Christmas present when he was eight. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved it and played all the time. His mother found a teacher for him, Bo Nilsson, who was a talented musician. Bo saw Hakan's natural talent and helped him a lot. Hakan is grateful for having such a good teacher who loved the trumpet and was always learning more about it.
Hakan explains that the trumpet is not a perfect instrument. Each trumpet has its own problems, and he learned to work with them. Even as a child, people could recognize his special sound. Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player who started in brass bands, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired Maurice Andre, a French trumpeter, and collected all his records.
Hakan's parents supported his dream to become a professional trumpet player. At 15, he needed to decide where to study. America was too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not for him. Hakan knew he was good, but it was during a competition in Paris at 17 that he realized he could really connect with people through music. He didn't win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and learned that people listened to him even if he made mistakes.
Hakan is realistic about his talent and doesn't try to explain why he can connect with people through music. He believes that the power of music is in its ability to move people.'"

The author is good at showing how people deal with big changes in their lives. He also shows how mothers feel they can never do enough for their children.
**C.** This book was nominated for the Booker Prize. It tells the story of one of the most remote Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The story is mixed with important moments in Scottish history, imagined by the young main character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He disappears at one point but comes back after World War II, now understanding the simple lives of his ancestors.
**D.** After a big hit, the author wrote a sequel with the same gentle humor and sharp look at family life. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is almost seventy. She has a lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora is still charming, a bit vain, and kind. Rosie helps her as she enjoys managing her suitors and friends. By the end, Aurora realizes that time has passed and a new generation is taking over. The author is good at showing the hidden sadness in everyday life and how random events can be.
**E.** Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful language to describe how each person learns about themselves during the trip. They return home with their spirits lifted by the experience of being on the ocean. The author uses surprising images to show themes of memory and awareness, which are both strange and enlightening."
CAE_20,C1,"**Take Five Careers**
Rebecca Cripps talks to five women about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical workday looks like.
**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34
**ANNE'S DAY**  
Anne wakes up at 6:30 am, goes to the gym at 7 am, and starts work by 8 am. She begins operating at 8:30 am. She operates all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most operations take three hours, but some can last all day. Sometimes, she works for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when and how to operate can be stressful. She doesn't feel stressed while operating, but she worries about the next day's work. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it feels great. From 10 am to 1 pm, she talks to patients about their operations. She enjoys this part and finds it easy to talk to them. If patients get upset, she comforts them, but time can be tight. She leaves work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, she is on call and carries a beeper. On holidays, she worries about her patients for the first three days and dreams about operating at night. She finds it hard to relax.
**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31
**MARITA'S DAY**  
Marita gets up at 7:45 am, leaves home by 8:20 am, takes the train, and arrives at work by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, her team meets to discuss their work and any problems. Her team has three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. Only 10-15% of her work is designing; the rest is production. She gets a brief from the client and spends three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After presenting her ideas to the client and getting approval, she works on budgets and hires photographers and illustrators. She communicates with printers to ensure everything is on time. Managing people is a big part of her job. She has to communicate well with many people. Lunch is at 1 pm for an hour, and she tries to go out. If not, she eats sandwiches and works through lunch. It's a great feeling when a client likes her designs, but disappointing if the work is rejected. She gets home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, often later. She finds it hard to relax after work, especially when busy.
**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42
**LINDA'S DAY**  
Linda usually gets up at 7 am, but on some days, she gets up between 4:30 am and 5 am to meet early flights. Around 10:30 or 11 am, she might go for a bike ride or swim. Since her job involves a lot of sitting, she watches her diet and exercises. She has a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask her for restaurant or shop recommendations, so she needs to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, so she can plan her routes. Not all passengers are polite; some are rude, but most are well-behaved. She has a good relationship with regular clients. Sometimes, she hears private conversations in the car and has to focus on driving. The press has tried to get her to talk about clients, but she doesn't. She works seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, and tries to sleep by 11 pm.
**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27
**TRACY'S DAY**  
Tracy gets up at 7 am, leaves home at 7:30 am, and starts her first job. She and her assistant maintain gardens they designed. They do some commercial work, but mostly private gardens. They spend about an hour and a half at each house. At 11 am, they have a big breakfast at a cafe. In summer, she may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. Her office is at home, so she checks messages and calls when she returns. If someone wants a garden designed, she meets them in the evening. They use old materials to make gardens look aged. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren't great, but it's satisfying to see a garden completed. It's hard to relax in the evening because she can hear the business phone. She sleeps well because the work is physical and tiring. The job is tough but allows creativity.
**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27
**ZENA'S DAY**  
Zena arrives at the site by 8:30 am. She is an assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a wall to keep cars from driving into a quarry. She checks that contractors follow the schedule and safety rules. She helps solve problems and coordinates with site professionals. Contractors start at 6 am, so she first checks with the clerk of works about what happened since she left. Her day depends on this information. She reviews paperwork and answers design questions. Lunch is usually half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but she often eats on the go. When contractors are on break, it's easier to check the site. Checking their work can cause conflict, so she keeps communication open. She sees the duty resident engineer once a day but acts quickly if something important happens. She leaves the site around 6 pm and is always on call."
CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards program in big European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and answering emails. I handle all advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to plan strategies and future projects. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss issues. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**
I start work at 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters, and invoices. The phone starts ringing at 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I try to be helpful because it's important work for the artists. I know if the sound fits our record label. After signing a band, we work on the first album, choosing songs, producers, and musicians. I share my vision of the album with the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets. I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest and often go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups a night. I might visit an artist in the studio after a concert. My social life is mostly related to work. I often get home at 1:00 am and listen to a record to relax.
**C. Sales Director**
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client visits, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and selling furniture. We sell antiques priced from £1,000 to £6,000 and buy from various sources. Many items need restoration, so I work with restorers and repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while having coffee to stay updated on the business. I visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I do the accounts once a month and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm and take about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**
I work in shifts, and on early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift in the control tower. We have a rotating schedule, working for about an hour and a half at a station, then taking a break. We work as a team to control aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I can read up on new air traffic rules. It's important to be alert in this job, so I take sick leave if I'm not feeling well. The work is stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and maybe a general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic sales system. I make sure someone is at the till and organize staff lunches and breaks. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, though it can be annoying when they expect me to gather many books for them. Between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, publishers' representatives visit to discuss new titles. I decide how many copies of a title to order. If we feature a new title, I ensure it's delivered on time. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. I work late shifts twice a week, closing the system and locking up before going home.
**F. Financial Analyst**
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies abroad, warning clients of potential problems. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. My first preview is due by 10:00 am, and the second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly. I type stories, send them to my editor, and make changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but it's hard to relax, and I'm often awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: How to Be a Good Leader at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader is someone who inspires others and helps bring change. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says leadership is about making things happen with people who are as excited as you are. Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says it's better to say ""I believe"" than ""I think.""
B. **Everyone Can Be a Leader**  
John van Maurik, who teaches leadership, says many people have the potential to be leaders. We just need the right situation to show it. We often see leaders as famous people like Mahatma Gandhi or Richard Branson, but leadership is also important in our own workplaces.
C. **Think About Your Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst bosses you've had. They might both be good at meeting goals, but how did they do it? A good leader motivates and supports you. A bad leader makes you feel unimportant and blames you when things go wrong.
D. **Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new paths. A good manager can keep things running, but a good leader can change a struggling company or team.
E. **Improve Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you're the boss or not, you can learn to be a better leader. Here are some tips:
- Find what you are passionate about and use that energy to lead.
- Think of yourself as a leader. Believe in your ability to lead.
- Sometimes you need to be firm. Try different leadership styles and see what works.
- Set goals and try to beat them. Look at your job and see where leadership can help you succeed.
F. **Developing Leadership**  
- Leadership takes practice. Take risks and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, and praise others.
- Your way of leading might not work for everyone. Keep improving your communication skills.
- Be visible and available to those who matter. Remember, you don't have to lead all the time. Know when your leadership is needed and help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before making Titanic, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller. It’s about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of heroes from old movies. The special effects are amazing, but the story and dialogue are not very strong. Despite the great filmmaking, the story feels like a simple B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal is directed by Andrew Marton. It is different from Terrence Malick's new film. Marton’s movie is a traditional war film, focusing on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick’s film is more complex, but Marton’s has its good moments. A flashback scene where the soldier dreams of his wife is very powerful.
**C. On Guard**  
Based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining adventure is better than most musketeer films. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, and Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil is a bit serious for this fun film, but he still shines as a swordsman. The film uses classic costume-drama ideas with humor and energy.
**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film looks like a museum piece due to its detailed design. Jan Decleir plays Dreverhaven, a harsh bailiff who evicts tenants. The story focuses on his difficult relationship with his son. However, the filmmakers seem more interested in showing the period details than exploring the story’s dark themes.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video highlights director Leone's skills. The sound is excellent, making every noise clear. The story is harsh, and the music by Morricone adds excitement. Morally, the characters (Clint Eastwood, Lee van Cleef, and Eli Wallach) are all equally ruthless as they travel across the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war epic boasts ""forty-eight international stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for the invasion, are slow. While impressive in scale, it’s better suited for the big screen. On video, it loses some of its impact."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A**  
""Compelling Evidence"" by Steve Martin is a very interesting book. The story is about a lawyer who starts a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife, who is accused of killing her husband. The trial is exciting, and the ending is surprising. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B**  
""Curtains for the Cardinal"" starts with excitement. Sigismondo, a problem-solver for rich people in the Italian Renaissance, gets involved in politics and murder. We know he will find the guilty people. The story is complex and a bit long, but still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C**  
""File Under: Deceased"" is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter, a tax inspector, becomes a detective when a man dies near her. She faces challenges and disapproval from a local detective, but she is strong and successful. Leah is a great new character.
**BOOK D**  
""Double Deuce"" by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, with more thinking than violence. Parker delivers high-quality entertainment.
**BOOK E**  
""False Prophet"" by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate a burglary and attack at a famous actress's daughter's house. The author's easy style and interesting look at human behavior make this a fun mystery.
**BOOK F**  
""Blood Red, Snow White"" is written by Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features a lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book mixes romance, money, and violence well, creating a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G**  
""Dead for a Ducat"" by Simon Shaw stars actor Philip Fletcher, who is now a target. A funny group of characters come together to film Robin Hood, but Philip is unhappy with his career. Shaw usually entertains, but this time the story is not as strong as usual.
**BOOK H**  
""Fall Down Easy"" by Lawrence Gough is his best book in a while. Canadian police chase a smart bank robber who targets female bank workers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the clever, troubled robber, making it better than the average detective novel."
CAE_57,C1,"""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age decide to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job, decided to rent out my apartment, and travel in Southeast Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to do it again someday. But then, I fell in love, started a career, bought an apartment, and got used to earning money. I realized I was giving up my happiness for my salary. When I quit my job, it felt like I was in control of my life again. Now, I have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn't change places with me, they envy my freedom. I'm not in a relationship, and I don't have big career goals. I feel like I should enjoy this freedom, even for my friends' sake! Why am I nervous? First, it's about making the necessary plans. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I need to decide where to go. I'm bad at making decisions and am already weeks behind my plan. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' Leaving emotional ties makes it harder. I'm delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I adjust to a simpler life? Will I fit in with young backpackers? Maybe not. I've found that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their lives and travel. Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebooks, says people realize they can have adventures if they're brave, organized, and confident. For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm ready to give up job security for the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a worry that I'm not moving up in my career, but it's a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, a year of traveling was a time of change. 'In the military, there's a set way of doing things. I needed to change this to live well as a civilian.' There are many reasons to travel at my age, but some common factors exist. 'We have a more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Big companies even have career-break policies. 'If you've trained someone, it's good to know they'll come back rather than work for a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, says more people in their thirties are rethinking their lives. 'If you're not happy with your job, it's not about just sticking with it. Now people know there are opportunities, and a job isn't ""for life"" anymore. Travel lets you reassess and think about your life.' Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can't handle adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks not. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we're less worried about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We're asking, ""Is this what I want?""' Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn't think he's running away. 'It's more about running towards something. It's trying to get things I want for myself.' But he feels some fear. 'It's the thought of leaving behind a comfortable routine - going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having a coffee.' I share Ben's worries about leaving a stable life, and I'm not sure I'd be traveling if I didn't find my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox says, 'This is common. There's often a reason, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to go.' It might have taken a push to get me moving, but I'm now excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, I'll be happy I took this chance. And I think all of us older backpackers feel the same."""
CAE_42,C1,"'Plugging in the home Georgina McGuiness had taken a long break from her job in journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. She shares how she turned her family home into a good place to work. The Christmas before last, when I turned 37, I realized I needed to restart my journalism career. My skills were outdated, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were the best technology. I felt like no one would hire me because I didn't know how to use computers or desktop publishing. I was afraid of technology; even simple things like calculators confused me. I knew I had to change quickly. I thought it would be hard to go back to work before my kids grew up, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Amazingly, my family won a computer package. We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We started learning about the Internet and new words like cyberspace and surfing. We began chatting with people around the world online. The kids stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem to connect to the Internet. I could work from home and still take the kids to school. The kids were comfortable with computers because they used them at school. I was nervous, thinking I might lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I learned the basics, and it was easier than I thought. I started writing articles for a magazine and felt happy to have the best of both worlds. The computer helped me become organized. I used spreadsheets to track money and pre-made invoices and letterheads to save time. Being online helped me research stories and talk to other journalists. But working from home can be lonely, and there are distractions like house chores. When the kids are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Many people are buying computers for education and fun. In my neighborhood, more people are working from home because it's easier than commuting to the city. A report on computer use in UK homes says the average user is 38 years old and well-educated. Most have a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. I feel like I'm ahead of the game. Maybe one day I'll send a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even start my own magazine from home. It seems the possibilities are endless.'"
CAE_59,C1,"The Tartan Museum
The new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh has modern buildings that look very different from the old city around them. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see if the inside was as interesting as the outside.
The museum is easy to find because of its big, yellow sandstone tower and unique shape. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building's design. Some loved it, calling it a 'masterpiece', while others were not so sure. Now, as the museum is about to open, people are wondering if the exhibitions inside will be just as interesting.
The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history, using important objects like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels. It helps visitors understand the timeline of events without being too strict. The museum does not let national pride overshadow the beauty of its treasures.
Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing the truth about history, so there are no fake scenes or imagined stories. Instead, the museum uses explanation panels, captions, and some computers to tell the stories of the objects.
Inside the museum, the spaces are open and bright, with walls that look like stone and display cases. There is plenty of room to look at each item. The museum also has a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of young advisors from all over Scotland. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a special hands-on area for kids.
On the top floor, there is a gallery about the Twentieth Century. It shows objects that people in Scotland think were important in the last century, like electric guitars and televisions. This part of the museum will change every three years.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects help us understand the past better than anything else. The modern design of the museum works well inside, but some people wonder if it fits with the old city around it."
CAE_54,C1,"The end of print newspapers might take a long time. Change can be scary for some people, but the word ""transition"" sounds nicer. It means moving smoothly from the present to the future. However, the move from print newspapers to online news is not smooth. Many people think it will happen because print sales are going down while visits to newspaper websites are going up. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% in a year, but their website visits are increasing.
But the situation is not the same everywhere. The World Association of Newspapers says that global newspaper circulation actually went up by 1.1% last year, thanks to Asia. In the West, sales went down, but in Asia, they went up. News magazines also saw a 5.4% increase. Books are another example. E-readers like Kindle are selling well, but physical book sales only went down by 0.4%.
Young people are still reading newspapers. Nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main national newspapers. In Europe, the situation is different in each country. In Britain, print sales dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop was only 7%, and in France, it was 3.1%.
In the past, people thought online ads would make online newspapers successful. But now, online ad revenue is going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online content. The best way to get people to pay is to offer both print and digital access together. Print is still important for selling online subscriptions, and print ads make more money than online ads.
This is not easy for newspaper companies because running both print and online editions is expensive. But print still helps newspapers stay well-known, while online, it is harder to get noticed."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more interesting than one without. But taking good photos of people can be hard. You need to think about how they move and their facial expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.
**A. Grouping People**
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all faces. You can also take the photo from a higher position.
**B. Posing for Pictures**
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting they fold their hands or put them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**
Don't pretend you are not taking a picture. This can make people uncomfortable. Most people will agree to be photographed, but they might feel self-conscious. You may need to guide them. Make sure they are not looking away from the camera.
**D. Eye Contact**
A photo is more powerful if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. Remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural. Candid shots are interesting, and the person's expression is important.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**
Expressions and gestures tell a lot about a person. A laughing child makes us smile, while a sad face makes us feel sympathy. Look for familiar expressions like winks, anger, or thumbs-up. They are easy to understand.
**G. Situation Interest**
A person's background can add interest to a photo. Make sure the background is not too busy. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person stand out more.
**H. Interaction**
When people are talking or working together, there are chances for good photos. Look for eye contact or physical contact, like a handshake. Capture how one person reacts to another.
**I. People and Places**
Many photos are taken on holidays to show where people have been. Use a wide-angle lens to include the background. Ask people to stand close to the camera. A good photo shows both the people and the place equally.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose. But family photos can be more fun if they are not posed. Candid photos capture real moments and are more memorable."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about Sarah and her work.
Sarah Janson is different from many artists because she doesn't sign her paintings unless someone asks her to. She believes the art is more important than the artist. Sarah is very humble and sometimes acts like her paintings create themselves. This makes her a bit shy during interviews. She doesn't like talking about herself and feels uncomfortable being photographed.
After some time, Sarah becomes more relaxed, and the interview turns into a fun and interesting conversation. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she wasn't happy with illustration, so she started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil, and she loved it. She decided to start her own business, even though she wasn't sure where it would lead.
Sarah's skills in observing and focusing on details, which she learned from illustrating, are very important for her trompe-l'oeil work. She says that no one can teach you trompe-l'oeil; it's all about observing life. She believes that you should always keep learning and never think you know everything.
Sarah is honest about her weaknesses. For example, she says she can't paint bread well. She also had trouble with math when working on a big project for a chapel ceiling. She often questions herself and talks about her work as if someone else did it.
Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art is very special and stands out from others. Her work is often inspired by architecture. For example, she painted a dining room to look like a Venetian palace and created a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to more rooms.

CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
**A** The way we work is changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or our skills, but also by how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging people helps decide who gets hired or promoted. It shows who might become a top performer and who might not. These skills are important for future jobs, no matter what field we work in. Doing well in exams is not as important as we thought. Instead, social skills and personal qualities like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness are important. These are called emotional intelligence.
**B** Today, job security is not guaranteed, and the idea of a 'job' is changing to 'portable skills'. Personal qualities are becoming important at work. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own and others' feelings. It includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it means just 'being nice', but sometimes it means telling the truth even if it's hard. It doesn't mean showing all your feelings, but managing them well so people can work together towards a common goal.
**C** More businesses see that emotional intelligence is important for management. The more complex the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. Some people succeed even with low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more team-based, companies where people work well together have an advantage. In today's workplace, teamwork and customer focus make emotional intelligence essential for success everywhere.
**D** Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from life. Studies show people get better at handling emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others. This growth is called maturity. Emotional intelligence can be learned, and we can add these skills to help us succeed. This is important when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but ignoring it can make everything else less effective."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they don't own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of important events. Social media has changed how people share these photos. Now, news often appears first on social networks, and some journalists use these images for their stories. Sometimes, reporters use photos from social media without asking for permission. There are rules that say images can be used without permission if there is a very important reason, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take a photo or video of a news event. This means that user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure people are paid for their work and always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West: Acupuncture**
**What is Acupuncture?**
Acupuncture is a part of ancient Chinese medicine, which is about 2,000 years old. It includes using herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is mainly known in the West for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it to help people feel less pain.
**How Does It Work?**
In traditional Chinese medicine, health means the energy of the mind, body, and spirit is balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), moves through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ. If Qi is blocked or weak, it can cause illness. An acupuncturist checks your wrist pulse, looks at your tongue, and asks about your health and habits to find where Qi is unbalanced. They use thin needles on the skin to help Qi flow better. Sometimes, they also use heat or pressure.
**Acupuncture Points**
There are over 300 points on the main meridians where needles can be placed. These points might not be near where you feel pain. People often feel a dull ache or tingling when the needle is used. This feeling means the needle has reached the Qi.
**Scientific View**
Even without believing in traditional Chinese ideas, some doctors agree that acupuncture can help with pain. They think it might work by blocking pain signals to the brain or by releasing natural painkillers in the body.
**Types of Pain Treated**
People with long-term pain often try acupuncture. It is used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in very sick people.
**Modern Use**
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia in surgery started in the 1950s. This showed some doctors outside China that acupuncture could be more than just a mental effect. In China, it is used in many surgeries, sometimes with electrical stimulation or drugs. It is said to reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia, like feeling sick.
**Effectiveness**
It is hard to test acupuncture in clinical trials, but some studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with chronic pain. Acupuncturists say it usually takes six or seven visits to feel real relief, but some improvement should be felt after two or three visits.
**Different Views on Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the symptoms. They spend time finding out what might be causing the pain, like weather conditions or the type of pain. This is different from how most doctors work.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals are trained in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe their methods can lead to longer-lasting cures. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist who will refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems very confident, like she could be the head of a girls' school, but she is actually quite shy. She says that her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is a bit like her, or how she might have been if she were a man. Both she and her character like to solve problems alone. She needs privacy to write and can work anywhere as long as she is alone.
P.D. James is very humble and doesn't agree when people say she is Britain's most famous crime writer, even though millions of people read her 12 detective novels. She enjoys reading books by her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she reads male authors too, like Graham Greene.
P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, ""Cover Her Face,"" was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband, Connor Bantry White. Life was difficult for her because her husband came back from World War II very sick. She had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped by taking care of the children.
She worked full-time for the National Health Service and later for the Home Office, dealing with police and crime. She got used to seeing dead bodies while working in forensic science, but she was more interested in writing crime stories. She liked the challenge of creating a story and always wanted to be a writer. Writing detective stories was a way for her to bring order to chaos and to write about people in a serious way. She believes solving a crime in a story shows that life is important, even if the person is not well-liked. She says nobody really likes violence."
CAE_5,C1,"Title: Handwriting Analysis: A Growing Interest
In some countries, when you apply for a job, you might be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This is because handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered important in deciding if you are right for the job. Many people believe that graphology is a real science. They say it can help identify illnesses like heart disease and cancer, and it can show a person's psychological state and emotions.
Graphology is being used more and more for career guidance and during job interviews. Many large companies hire graphologists to study the handwriting of people applying for important jobs. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not convinced about the value of graphology.
Patricia Marne, who has been a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks that doctors should take graphology more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. According to her, handwriting can indicate social class, intelligence, mental ability, and whether a person is more suited to arts or sciences. It can also show if someone has a devious or open character.
Ms. Marne says graphology can be useful in identifying criminal tendencies. She claims that criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. She believes that many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional issues, which can be seen in their handwriting. For example, young male offenders often have high ascenders in their writing, suggesting they live in a world of fantasy.
Graphologists can also tell if someone is under a lot of pressure or has violent tendencies. Handwriting might even predict if someone is at risk of suicide. Health problems, like heart and lung issues, can also appear in handwriting. If a person's writing changes over time or becomes shaky, it might mean something serious has happened.
Ms. Marne explains that handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For instance, people who write with 'threads' instead of clear letters might be clever but devious. Writing in all capitals could mean someone is hiding their true self. Light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting shows confidence and artistic talent. Disconnected writing is a sign of a loner. Small signatures might indicate shyness and low self-esteem, while circles over the 'i' show a need for attention. Crossing the 't' heavily can mean someone is intolerant and patronizing.
Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting well, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a recognized science. She thinks it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can reveal a person's history and emotions without asking questions.
Despite these claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists argue that handwriting is just a result of education, artistic skill, and the style of writing taught, and it doesn't have any deeper meaning."
CAE_41,C1,"Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy team, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies people's working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions:
Office A: Advertising Agency
- Building Health Consultant: This office is very simple with no central heating or mechanical ventilation. The windows open directly onto the street. The team of seven people seems happy and adapts to the seasons by opening doors and using electric heaters, like at home. They have created a comfortable work environment without much outside control.
- Ergonomist: The furniture is mismatched and often creates bad working positions. Chairs are old, not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the team has a varied work schedule, which helps prevent tiredness and boredom.
- Occupational Psychologist: The staff enjoys the variety of work and the flexible office space. The office is the right size for knowing what others are doing but also having personal space. It feels efficient and creative.
Office B: News Service
- Building Health Consultant: The office is comfortable and the air quality is good, helped by a No Smoking policy.
- Ergonomist: The company has used an ergonomist before. Chairs, lighting, and computer equipment are good, but the layout could be better. The environment is impersonal with grey walls.
- Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare except for planners and a maternity rights poster. Staff relationships are okay, but the office could improve by making it easier to share information and displaying success stories.
Office C: Bank
- Building Health Consultant: The office feels like being in a glass case. Despite smokers, the air is not stale. You can't smell smoke even close to a smoker.
- Ergonomist: The office is standard and uninspiring. Desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet requirements. Computer setups are outdated.
- Occupational Psychologist: Staff support each other and have good technology. The office is busy, but the wood paneling and brown carpet make it look dull.
Office D: Newspaper
- Building Health Consultant: The air-conditioning is poor, causing temperature changes. The space is cluttered and dusty. The roof collects dust, which falls on people.
- Ergonomist: The furniture is more suited for a workshop. Chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially shorter people. Many chairs are old and not adjustable.
- Occupational Psychologist: The office has old chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. Few people were talking, and everyone seemed stressed. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"Chewing Gum Culture
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million pieces every day. It started as an old custom and is now a big business. Each piece of gum has less than ten calories, but it is still considered food and must meet the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration. 
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. But in the past, things were different. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, found in Greece and Turkey, to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum there.
Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more elastic, leading to a new industry. However, growing sapodilla trees commercially has not worked well, so synthetic alternatives were developed as the gum market grew.
Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a tough and dangerous job. They travel long distances in hot, humid conditions to collect sap from scattered sapodilla trees. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects, including the chicle fly, which lays eggs in their ears and nose. Chicleros climb trees with just a rope and an axe to collect the sap, which they carry to a camp to boil and make into bricks. Life at the camp is hard, with a simple diet and local alcohol.
Despite the hard work, chicleros worry about their jobs. The U.S. used to import 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As gum sales have increased, manufacturers use synthetic materials to cut costs and meet demand.
Gum producers are also finding new ways to market their products. They claim gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tension. During both world wars, soldiers were given gum. The biggest claim is that gum reduces tooth decay by increasing saliva flow, which helps protect teeth. Research continues on new textures and flavors, with most new flavors being artificial. However, some still need natural ingredients. In the U.S., 137 square kilometers are used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

CAE_47,C1,"'The Hotel Inspector Sue Brown checks hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watched her work. Just one minute into her yearly check, things are already going wrong at the Globe Hotel. The receptionist is talking on the phone about room prices and doesn't notice Sue, the real guest, waiting. 'She hasn't even greeted us,' Sue whispers. 'Very poor.' This is a common mistake Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't a normal three-star hotel,' she says. 'It has three red stars, so I expect better.' Having red stars means the Globe is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide from the organization Sue works for. Even before the cold welcome, things were not good. The way from the car park was through an empty door with a buzzer, then a long, empty hallway to the hotel entrance. 'Not what I expected,' says Sue. Could it get worse? Yes. 'We don't have your booking,' says the receptionist in a polite voice. That night, 12 of the hotel's 15 rooms are empty. One room is on the top floor. Sue doesn't like it: it's stuffy, and there's a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. When she started her job, she was known for being tough. 'They called me The Woman in Black,' she remembers, 'which was funny because I never wore black. And I was never too tough.' The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the Globe's manager, Robin Greaves, who she is. He looks scared. Before she says more, he apologizes for the bad smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocked drain,' he says. 'We might have to take up the whole floor.' Sue suggests fixing the plumbing and not taking guests to that room. 'Better to take them to the other lounge,' she says. Greaves agrees and takes notes. He's been at the Globe for only five months and finds it hard to believe Sue when she says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run. Not everything is bad. She praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, who shared notes about the hotel's 400-year history. Dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating, which makes Greaves ask, 'What do we need to get three rosettes?' Sue suggests, 'Don't serve a dessert that falls apart.' The hope in Greaves' eyes fades. Sue's job is to say the complaints that other guests are too scared to mention. 'Sometimes it's very sensitive. Once, a woman called to say I got her son fired. I just told the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers.' Sue also writes a full report for the hotel. They pay for her advice. (There is a yearly fee to be in the guide.) But having red stars is worth it. Greaves is happy to hear Sue won't suggest taking away the Globe's red stars. That's the good news. The bad news is another inspector will come in the next two months to check if everything is fixed. 'Good,' says Greaves, not very convincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.''"

Doug Scott and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave near the top of Mt. Everest. Dougal started talking to someone who wasn't there, which Doug thought was due to lack of oxygen. Doug was worried about frostbite but felt confident climbing with Dougal. They reached the summit by finding a good climbing rhythm.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
In April 1976, Doug and Dougal climbed Mt. McKinley, known as a very dangerous mountain. They carried all their equipment and food on their backs, which was a new way to climb there. The climb was tough because of the low air pressure, making it feel like they were higher than they were. They reached the summit and felt triumphant.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and Paul Braithwaite went to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the jungle and struggled to find water. They followed a trail of rubbish to a water source. After some challenges, they reached the summit using the Umbwe route.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, climbed Aconcagua. They met a guide who suggested a different route away from the busy path. Due to time limits, they skipped the glacier and joined the standard route. They reached the summit and met other climbers who inspired Doug to consider climbing all Seven Summits.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
In November 1992, Doug's team traveled to Antarctica to climb Vinson Massif. The weather was harsh, with strong winds and very low temperatures. Despite this, they reached the summit in 8 hours. The visibility was poor due to a storm, but they were happy to have made it.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team climbed Elbrus. They started from a high point using a cableway and walked to a refuge. The climb was challenging due to strong winds and icy slopes. They thought they reached the summit but realized there was more to climb. They returned safely the next day.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**

The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. The system cost £250,000, but MacCann believes it will be worth it. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them next time. This is possible because of the guest-history feature, where staff can save guest preferences. Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little themselves, or the front desk can adjust it more. Business guests will like the technology in their rooms. MacCann thinks 65% of the hotel's business will come from business travelers. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that is also a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing tool. Technology changes fast, so the hotel has prepared for future updates. Extra cables are ready for new technology. TVs are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models. DVD players can also be updated. Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also has a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food at the hotel must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He has a new modern kitchen and better parking. The hotel gets a popular restaurant without financial risk. With technology and a great staff, the Merrion is likely to do well.'"
FCE_24,B2,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. She gets many ideas from the large garden around her house. This garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The garden has a nice mix of colors and shapes, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan likes, and she also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny didn't agree with some of her ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She says, ""I don't set everything up at once. I paint one flower, which might take a few days, then I add another one."" Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they age very interesting. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day.
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then because she thought they looked fake. She was amazed by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rocks or cliffs. Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas, but they grow well in her garden too. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.

FCE_13,B2,"Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the big storms in March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town center look different, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been upset too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a strong and healthy man, but he got very sick with bronchitis for the first time. When he first felt a headache and chest pain, his wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forgetful and grumpy. Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. She took him to get his medicine and then home to his wife, who sent him to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, but he couldn't understand it. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged, was relieved to hear it wasn't, and went back to sleep. On Saturday, when he felt better, he saw that the missing walnut tree changed how the living room looked. The Pelhams' big house had a large garden. It was expensive, but Pelham was happy they bought it. The garden made it feel private. But now, the storm changed things. Before, the walnut tree was part of the view from the living room. It didn't make the room dark because there was another window, but it made nice light patterns that hid the old furniture they brought from their last house. Without the tree, the room was very bright, and the old furniture looked shabby. The view from the window was also bad. The tall house next door, which the tree used to hide, was now visible with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It had many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. ""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. ""I've been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,B2,"Living in the Valley
We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. In our valley, we only felt sudden strong winds; trees moved, but the branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had a reason to worry.
The snow and wind were inconvenient, but they did not trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if things were different, if the water from the hills had not been controlled by dams many years ago. Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. Grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we watched the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling and getting close to danger.
Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it was like Niagara Falls, as water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water rushed down to its lower parts. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting its banks hard. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the waters began to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river often flooded nearby villages in this way. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only small overflows. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and be amazed by the river's power. Thanks to this, we feel our home in the valley is still safe and secure."
FCE_21,B2,"Mark Adams has been a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page for the last ten years. Writing about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he wrote reviews for novels, films, and radio for different places. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, through radio and TV work. Tom hired him, but Tom wasn't mainly a journalist, or he might have chosen his team more carefully. 
At first, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover arts like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio, which didn't need special knowledge. They would have weekly lunches to choose what to review, and there would be guests to make it fun. It felt like a dream for Mark: a new newspaper, and he was part of it. He couldn't believe a new paper could succeed in a busy market. He even thought a millionaire might be pretending to hire him just to help him. He was not very confident. The first time he saw someone reading his review on the London Underground, he felt awkward.
Tom's plan for a team of critics didn't work out. It was a good idea, but they didn't meet as planned and did everything by phone. People preferred critics to focus on one subject, so Mark chose film. Thanks to Tom's push, Mark now writes a long piece each week, usually about one film. This way of working suits him. He wouldn't like the usual film critic's job of reviewing every film. That would make him bored quickly. He would soon be complaining about bad films, like many critics do.
Mark's role is not to tell people which films to watch. He thinks people choose films based on stars, publicity, or directors. People are loyal to certain types of films. It's rare for someone who hates westerns to watch one because of a review, or for a romance fan to skip a love story because of a bad review. So, a film review isn't really a guide for choosing films. Mark doesn't feel he has to be 'right' about a movie. He doesn't think there should be a set number of 'great' or 'bad' films each year. His job is to present an argument. He is not a judge, and he doesn't want to be one."
FCE_46,B2,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because she thinks it's fun. A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner. The partner should be a sports enthusiast, preferably female, and interested in distance running, swimming, and cycling. The triathlon is becoming a popular Olympic sport. Many people are amazed by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and run 10km without stopping. But why do these athletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a smart 17-year-old girl give up everything for this tough sport?
Melanie Sears, a 17-year-old, hasn't learned the usual phrases athletes use about personal satisfaction and mental challenges. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then jump on your bike while still wet. You freeze, and after cycling 40km, you have to run 10km. It's exhausting, but it's great fun and worth it in the end.""
Melanie did her first triathlon at 14 and won the junior section because she was the only junior. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. Even though she had the second-fastest swim and the fastest run, she didn't win. She got lost during the cycling part and ended up cycling 20km too far. She cried during the running but didn't give up.
Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching, admires her determination. He says she worked so hard on the running machine that it threw her off. Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She is working hard to improve her cycling.
Her parents are paying for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, and she hopes they will buy her a new bike. Her intense training means she doesn't have much of a social life. She says, ""I'm not a party person. After two hours of swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I keep in touch with my teammates.""
Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon 'sprint,' which is shorter. She wants to try even tougher events. She says, ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with."" It's interesting, isn't it?"
FCE_70,B2,"'The Collectors Amanda Roy talks about her hobby of collecting things and why many people enjoy it too. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults shares this hobby. It is a world full of passion and excitement. But remember, if you don't love an object, don't collect it. Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful. I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England. It was cold and windy, surrounded by hills. My parents took me to a local museum full of old collected objects. I was fascinated by them. Many people share this interest in collecting. One in three adults enjoys it. People collect for different reasons. Some feel it gives them control over something in their lives. For me, it's just fun. A famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders' with coconut shell cups, carved ivory beads, and Oriental china. Catherine the Great of Russia collected over 4,000 paintings. But you don't need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups with great determination. I remember convincing another tulip collector to give me one I wanted. I planted and cared for it, but one year it was stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for them. This collection was lost in a house fire. The next day, I saw the remains of my furniture and collection. I don't know which loss made me sadder. I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or poet becomes valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. Toys from the 1950s are now valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I threw mine away, along with the toys.)'"
FCE_3,B2,"**My Job: Four People Talk About Their Work**
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**
I organize temporary exhibitions at the Science Museum. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. First, I learn about the exhibition topic and talk to experts to decide the main themes and goals. I choose what objects and pictures to show. I make sure visitors understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to ensure everything is safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**
I start my day at 7.30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I prepare new maps and documents for students to learn the routes needed for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are at school, figuring out the best routes using the correct streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like if a right turn is possible at a junction. When students are close to the test, I challenge them by asking for different routes, even if the road is closed, to make them think.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**
I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but mostly I am by the sea. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for people who manage the coast. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better. This often changes their views. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. However, I work for a charity, so we always need more money, which means I can't do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**
My job is varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and keep stocks of about 300 books we publish. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, which need careful replies. I talk about future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with an enthusiastic team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,B2,"We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes to it, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel recommended by friends, but it wasn't good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school because Dekko Deacon sounds nice. He and Strafe went to school together, so we call Strafe by his last name like the teachers did. We're all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it's quite a coincidence. ""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are about to arrive because she's usually waiting in the large hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" These are the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that, and her husband does the redecoration and repairs. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I felt that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led us to the rooms, carrying as much of our luggage as he could and then coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not too long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because in June, Glencorn Lodge is always full. From where we sat by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the seashore. In the morning, we'd do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then come back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we'd drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we developed this routine. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,B2,"'Keeping the holiday-makers happy Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex. This is her second year working as a chalet girl. Sarah, also called Pilch, works for a company that takes care of visitors who come to ski. She cooks and cleans in the wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more serious job. 'It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. 'They get porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.' After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. She skis as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.' Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower first. She does not take a nap because it makes her too tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans up after dinner and loads the dishwasher. 'I don't like coming to a messy kitchen in the morning.' Sometimes she talks with the guests, other times they want to be alone. 'Good guests make the week fun, but some weeks are not as good.' Sarah meets her friends where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. 'We start at Bananas, then maybe go to G Jay's, and end at Dick's T-Bar,' she says. But she never stays out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. 'It's a tough day,' she says, 'and you don't want to cook breakfast with a headache.' On Sunday, work starts earlier because breakfast for leaving guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After they leave, Sarah cleans quickly. 'We clean everything - clear breakfast, change the beds, get everything ready.' If she didn't shop on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for new guests. 'They arrive around 4:30 p.m.' Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I think the mountain air affects them.' Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it's time for dinner again, and maybe a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,' she says."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie. However, she said she was about six years older. One day, she visited Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her pretty face was surrounded by curly hair. She was so small and young-looking that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help a student by answering questions on the phone or giving a short tour if he thought they were serious. Rita Cohen seemed as small as the children from Marie's third-year class. Years ago, these children visited the factory to see how gloves were made. Marie's favorite part was the laying-off table, where the gloves were shaped and pressed over hot brass hands. These hands were very hot, shiny, and stood straight up from the table. Marie called them the 'pancake hands' because they looked flat.
Rita asked Seymour, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked more questions. Seymour liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained that the tannery, a contractor, made the leather for them. His grandfather, father, and he himself had worked in the tannery. He offered to arrange a visit for her, saying tanneries were old-fashioned places. He mentioned that tanning is one of the oldest industries, with relics found in Turkey. The first clothes were made from smoked skins.
Seymour said his father was the real expert on leather and could talk about gloves for days. He asked Rita if she had ever seen anything being made. She said she hadn't, except for watching her mother bake a cake as a child. This made Seymour laugh. Rita reminded him of Marie, with her eagerness to learn and good-natured intelligence. He decided to show her the whole process of making gloves and asked her what size she wore."
FCE_71,B2,"'Is it a dream job? Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem. A. Raquel Graham Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She can't meet me tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. There's just one small problem - she doesn't like flying. 'On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,' she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. 'It felt so closed in with those tiny windows.' When she's not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork - organizing the diary, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning schedules, and making more travel plans. She didn't apply for the job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance, which led to a job offer. She took a secretarial course in the evenings at the same time. Five years later, she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. B. David Brown David Brown has been both an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he liked being a caddy more. Well, you would too if golf was your passion. There were some downsides though. A small flat fee is given, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, and much of that is spent on travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're giving advice, using your knowledge against the weather, and trying to understand the course.' His accountancy skills were noticed by European Tour Productions, and they made him a statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he collects and analyzes the statistics of each day's play. The results are wanted by TV commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. C. Martin Fern Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to try the food in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge very high prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's their choice,' he says. 'I'd rather spend £120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' His talent as a cook led to the offer of a food column from a friend who edited a Saturday Review. For Martin, who was then a creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper called to offer him a full-time job. 'It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to turn my passion into a profession.' He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his weight under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. D. Dick Prince 'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I always loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mostly wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That's what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's notes - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those laptops. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help.'"
FCE_66,B2,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were made into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles covered the yard all the way to the blue lake. One afternoon, with nothing else to do, Michael and his friends climbed a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed on the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to jump too. Laughing, he watched them look down from the roof, scared, but then one by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. Then one of them said, ""Let's go up and jump again."" They weren't very excited, but they all went up and started jumping off again until only Michael was left. The others were below, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump and join them, but he stayed on the roof, nervous and smiling awkwardly, wondering why it seemed so much higher this time. At first, they thought he was joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried counting to ten and then jumping, but it didn't work. He tried taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. After a while, his friends started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward. Do you think we're going to wait all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they started to leave, still shouting. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called. But he stayed on the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set beyond the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating nervously. Finally, he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the sawdust, and lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to come home on time for dinner. If you can't, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, with his dark, sad face, hardly heard her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy with your job but unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change jobs are now turning to careers advisers. You will need to write a short history of yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. These tests help to suggest different careers and any retraining you might need.
I decided to try Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school exams. I was with about ten other people, answering questions quickly. It was not about passing or failing. The tests included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes. After the tests, I talked with an adviser who gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of his ideas, but I was surprised to learn I did poorly in scientific and technical tests. I was glad to hear I made the right choice in journalism.
Changing your career doesn't always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts. 'Losing my job was a chance to look at my career and skills,' says Donna. She was surprised to learn she had a talent for design. But she had to think about the cost of retraining. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Donna decided to use her current skills and now works in Public Relations. She believes Career Analysts helped her understand what she wanted to do. She has recommended them to friends who are also happy with the service.
Some people feel they couldn't have made changes without help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and made big decisions. After working at a bank for six years, she found her job boring and wanted a new challenge. The tests showed she was interested in sciences. After four sessions with an adviser, she decided to study geology and plans to start a degree course. She feels the advice was worth the cost and is now much happier.
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says she didn't know where to go in her career. She hoped a careers adviser would suggest something new. Although she got many ideas, she rejected them because they required a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. She felt she didn't learn anything new about herself and thought a friend could have given similar advice."
FCE_22,B2,"Title: 'A Fun Visit to the Dentist?'
If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch for patients. Jerome says, ""Half of the people only go to the dentist when they are in pain, not for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared."" To change this, he has made his office a place where people feel comfortable. He decided not to wear a white coat because it reminds people of pain. Jerome believes dental visits should be relaxing, interesting, and even fun.
This idea is surprising for many people who think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ideas is using virtual-reality headsets. His office was the first in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, patients sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater wildlife while Jerome checks their teeth. Then, the headset shows a camera view inside their mouth. Many patients enjoy this part of their visit.
Another important thing is the smell in the office. It smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome says, ""When people come in, I want them to know it's not like a regular dentist's office. Smell is important. The usual dental smell can make people nervous."" I found the smell very nice.
Even though Jerome is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist, he takes his work seriously. Relaxation is important, but good treatment is the most important. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but it is not painful if you are relaxed.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. He learned that making things easier for patients also makes it easier for dentists. He thinks this patient-focused approach is the start of a change in the traditional British dental profession.
Just then, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he wants to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it's easy to see why. The office feels more like a fancy beauty salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,B2,"Title: The Story of Chocolate
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is when 8% of all chocolate is bought. Only at Christmas do people eat more chocolate.
Chocolate has been made in factories since the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan people in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans due to a spelling mistake from the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and to make a drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water' in their language. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies. The Spanish liked it better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took a century to spread to the rest of Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in Europe's capital cities where people drank chocolate.
Until the last century, chocolate drinks were made from solid blocks of chocolate melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when Fry and Sons in Bristol mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block. A Swiss company later added milk solids, creating milk chocolate.
At the start of the 20th century, French companies led the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to add some French style. But Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, first called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular with ads linking it to healthy English milk. Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week.
To attract more customers, chocolate makers are creating new products like chocolate ice cream, soft drinks, and desserts. Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still struggling from a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, next time you eat a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and has become very skilled in his art. He still wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he focuses on making beautiful and unique objects from shells, a skill he has perfected over the last ten years.
When showing his work, Peter says, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" He is not boring; he is very enthusiastic and charming. He shows me shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace and says he doesn't mind if they don't sell because he loves them. He never planned to sell his work, but friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. Five years ago, he had his first exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition just opened, and his pieces are quite expensive, with some costing around £2,000.
Peter says he wishes he had started this art earlier in life because he could have made even more amazing things. Although he has many ideas, he feels more limited physically now. Still, his work is very different from the usual shell crafts found in seaside shops. He creates tiny, detailed boxes, pictures, and flower baskets using shells.
Peter has his own way of working. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says his work almost creates itself, but the detail and color in his pieces show a lot of skill.
To find beautiful shells, Peter has traveled to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming beaches. He says that many shells are crushed by people walking on them or broken by the sea. He believes that collecting empty shells is not harmful and that his art gives them new life."

I was trying to forget all the bad things I had read about models, like being difficult, vain, and unintelligent. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she decided going to the hairdresser's was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to answer my questions. But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, and she was with her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. She didn't seem selfish; she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work, she explained, and apart from looking very young, her mother was a normal mum - clearly proud of her successful daughter. Kira seems a bit surprised by her new fame, which makes sense since it was not planned. It was her older sister who decided she should enter the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should try it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to go through with it, and she did great. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I think too much of myself.' This must be hard for Kira, since there aren't many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They think that because I've become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.' As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her she is needed for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us"".' Kira has the looks, ability, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even finish their school exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.'"
FCE_49,B2,"Title: Father and Son Search for Gold
Terence and Chris Madden, a father and son team, have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa looking for gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They believe their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, said, ""We are finding a lot of gold as we dig; we just need to go a few more meters to find where it is concentrated.""
The Maddens have spent their lives searching for gold. Their journey began when Terence read about gold worth millions in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. They studied old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth to find the best place to dig. After clearing the land and finding small pieces of gold, they spent ten years getting permission to dig, taking earth samples, and cleaning up the area. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it looks difficult, but we have some people we can ask.""
As news of their dig spread, people in the area became interested. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and locals are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, more people might visit, but I hope not too many come and damage the hillside.""
The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed recently. However, some people are still looking for gold. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. Hall, who is 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's exciting and adventurous, like finding hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"**IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves to explore the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University, where she teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemical processes in the sea. When she is not teaching, she goes on dives to study underwater volcanoes.
Rachel uses a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to dive three kilometers down into the ocean. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight. She can touch the two pilots sitting next to her. They cannot stand up or move much, and they have to stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.
If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it might not be a pleasant ride.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She was on a ship's deck with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, like what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew near the Canary Islands. They explored a large area of underwater volcanoes, where black smoke comes out of the chimneys. The Russian team was setting up equipment to study the effects of a project that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it so she can continue her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. The water flows at one meter per second and is 350 degrees hot.
Rachel was only scared once, during a dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a loud explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and Rachel thought she was going to die. But nothing happened, and they were relieved to be safe.
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the window and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, seeing things no one else has seen before. After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in real life was an amazing experience for her."
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit suntanned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind couldn't handle any more foreign schedules, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. But I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. All I needed was one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a regular bed. The train's movement helps you sleep deeply. Carrying everything in a backpack makes you travel simply. You might even throw away socks that smell bad or books you have finished. This way of thinking is part of the Inter-Rail experience. You can forget about common sense and just enjoy the freedom. All you need is one of those tickets. This system lets young people visit many countries quickly. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling all the time was too exciting. There was always another country to visit, just a little further away. And it didn't cost us anything extra. We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was our first holiday without parents, like most other Inter-Railers. We made our own schedule and only saw the sights that were easy to reach. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I saw was the view from the train station. We were there to enjoy ourselves. We were like other Inter-Railers, sharing train floors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. It's like the city didn't exist until you arrived and saw it with your own eyes. Only by seeing Europe, watching the landscapes change, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles, can you really understand the continent. Everyone knows what's there, but it doesn't mean much until you see it yourself. That's why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip won't show you anything new in the world, it's a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people the best chance to see this, even if it takes time to realize."
FCE_37,B2,"Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out your baggage is missing is very disappointing. At best, you might have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your luggage. At worst, you could be in a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Airlines don't often say how many bags they lose, but regular travelers know that sometimes luggage gets lost. Even the best airlines make mistakes, and no airline can promise that your checked luggage will always be on the same flight, especially if you have to change planes.
Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give enough time for baggage to be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest times needed to transfer between flights, and these are also set to allow for baggage transfers. Usually, the system works well, but extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights and cause baggage issues. Human error or accidents, like a torn-off destination label, can also cause problems. These issues are more common at large transfer airports, called 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, mostly moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4. Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich have bad days. The risk of losing baggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights to Latin America.
To avoid losing your baggage, choose direct flights when possible and check in early. If you must change planes or if it makes your flight cheaper, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Include your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline official in the baggage hall and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"'The Kingfisher Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, partly shading the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, mud browns, and different yellows from the sunlight, as gentle as the sound of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly and straight through the scene, like a flash of light. It disappears in a second, but the image stays in your mind, its impact bigger than its size. Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He can't really say why he loves this little bird so much. There are many stories about it. In Greek myth, the kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top turned blue like the sky, and its bottom was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this. Even though kingfishers look blue, their feathers have no blue color. The structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich green, depending on the light. It's easy to see why some wildlife photographers love them. The colors and the fact that kingfishers can be watched from a hideout make them fascinating. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in minutes and sat just a meter away. But it took him four years to get his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became very important in his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream full of kingfishers. But school took away time from the birds, so he missed classes and didn't do well in school. However, people noticed his interest in the kingfisher, the only one of its family to breed in Europe. At 16, he got a job as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and later became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the best kingfisher film. 'No talking, just beautiful images,' he says. 'I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings...' He stops, thinking about the bird he has spent so much time with, which still excites him. His photos show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows there is more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show.'"
FCE_68,B2,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from Five New Conductors**
**A. Anne Manson**
Anne Manson, 30, got a chance to conduct when she asked to watch Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up replacing an absent assistant and later helped with another opera. Anne, who is American, works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. She has worked with Abbado on several projects since her first opportunity.
**B. Andrew Constantine**
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is convincing people to give you opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after failing in two others. He thinks the timing was perfect because if he had won earlier, he might not have succeeded. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he worries about being known only for the competition. He is happy that orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra invite him back, as this is important for his career.
**C. Wasfi Kani**
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods in opera. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's business area until Pimlico Opera became fully professional. Learning from Sian Edwards was important for her because she realized that size doesn't matter in conducting. She likes the complexity of opera, including dealing with singers' personalities.
**D. Roger Vignoles**
Roger Vignoles, 48, found conducting unexpectedly interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, which was new for him. He found it easier than expected because he knew the music well. He is using all his past experiences in music and performance. Now, he is open to trying different things to see what he enjoys.
**E. Wayne Marshall**
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, now 32, and recommended him. Marshall soon conducted a musical in London on short notice, which was challenging. He had to be firm with musicians who were not paying attention. He always gives a clear beat and is not afraid to express what he wants. Although he never formally studied conducting, he is determined and knows what he likes. People have been supportive of him."
FCE_23,B2,"**Variations on a Theme**
If you want to take children to a theme park in Britain, there are many options. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns family**
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. But we were surprised. The park is great for young children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay longer because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and scenery. However, the staff are very helpful, and the park is clean, well-organized, and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan family**
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a road. We spent six hours there and liked that there were places to rest. The park looks beautiful, and the staff are friendly. There is something for everyone, including adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**
After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus with its exciting trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you'll get wet, but you don't. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small for it. The park is well-designed, so even waiting in line isn't too boring. It's very clean, and the staff are great. On one ride, I couldn't sit with both girls, so a staff member went with one of them.
**The Great Park - The Langridge family**
We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides aren't too scary. I'm usually scared, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then gets exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn't go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you're brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**
The park says there is 'No Limit to the Fun,' and we agree. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very scary, and Ben thought it was the most frightening ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. The staff were sometimes great with young children, but not always friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We couldn't tell the kids we were leaving early."

**A. Christine Hogan**  
Christine Hogan runs a computer-aided design business with her husband. They moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. Christine wanted a job she could do from home. She had experience with computers, so she started her own business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. Christine was careful with spending and always informed the bank if she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. Her business is small, and local customers usually pick up their work.
**B. Maggy Sasanow**  
Maggy Sasanow is a designer of greeting cards and works from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no such jobs in the countryside. So, she started her own business, creating 50 different greeting cards that she sells to museums. She works in a large room at home. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She doesn't advertise; her business grows through word of mouth. Although she misses sharing ideas with others, she finds more benefits than drawbacks in her work.
**C. Delia Turner**  
Delia Turner has a curtain-making business. She started it eight years ago when this type of business was growing. Her business grew quickly, and she managed six full-time workers. But when the economy got worse, she had to let them go, which was hard because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and hires women who work from their homes. Delia has to be flexible with prices and look for new opportunities.
**D. Tessa Strickland**  
Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago because it was cheaper than London and she loves the country. She enjoys working when she wants, but her business requires her to take calls at odd hours because most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America. The challenge is to stop working and close the office door. She publishes children's books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because all her experience was in London.
**E. Meg Rivers**  
Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop. She started ten years ago at home, making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. Friends and family began requesting her cakes, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made. She has a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg now manages the business side and doesn't bake anymore. Her biggest challenge has been managing the finances because she didn't have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons, Paul and Huw, are talented musicians and composers, and their father, John, makes musical instruments.
When Paul was ten years old, his parents, John and Hetty, wanted to buy him a cello because he was getting very good at playing. However, cellos were very expensive. John decided to try making one himself. He found a school nearby that taught instrument making and took evening classes for about three years. After practicing with violins and violas, he made his first cello for Paul. It turned out well, and Paul used it for many years.
John enjoyed making instruments so much that he retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman. He now makes about twelve violins a year. One of his violins was even bought by a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.
Both Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul first played the piano and then became interested in the cello. He was inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, on the other hand, chose to play the piano and compose music.
Paul achieved great success with the cello his father made. He won a big music competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. Recently, he started playing a very old and valuable cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is on loan to him.
Paul will soon be on television playing this new cello in a famous piece, Elgar's Cello Concerto. However, he won't be able to watch himself because he will be performing at a festival that night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will be performed in London for the first time.
John and Hetty are very proud of their sons and will have to work hard to keep up with all their musical events."
FCE_53,B2,"'Looking after the countryside THE NATIONAL TRUST The National Trust is an organization that works to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden for the Trust. According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and must be good with people because they often work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and builders. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula, but Gareth got it because he knew the area well and had farming experience, even though he didn't have formal training. He still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand farmers' problems. His farming background also helps him with the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and building walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers and bird nests as a child and realizes now that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it's not the farmers' fault because they were following government advice. When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists disagreed, but now they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's work includes conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He makes sure jobs are done efficiently and enjoys seeing projects completed, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork. Gareth loves his job, even though he is always on duty, and enjoys talking to most of the public. However, he dislikes when some people act entitled. If you have common sense and like outdoor work, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth, but don't expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula to open up soon!'"
FCE_55,B2,"'The Netball Captain In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked her. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice. I might see cars slow down, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 'I have a strict schedule to get as fit as possible.' These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries taking part. 'We'll have support from people at home, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start with a good game.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of skill.' The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra says, the World Championships will be hard. 'You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, there's only one chance, and you have to be ready.' In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. 'But after the final whistle, we are all friendlier.' Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and must lead by example. I support and encourage the team.' 'From the start, my netball career was carefully planned,' she says. 'I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player.' She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye.'"
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them grow their talent. Some parents might not notice their child's musical needs until the child becomes upset or difficult. Regular schools are usually good at helping children who are smart in subjects like math or science, but musically talented children need special care that regular schools might not offer. 
Specialist music schools can be a good choice for these children. In Britain, there are five such schools. They help children aged seven to eighteen to improve their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras, learn about singing, conducting, and music theory. They also practice for several hours each day. The rest of their time is spent on important subjects like English, math, science, and languages. 
These schools are private, and classes are small with more teachers for each student. Most students live at the school, which means they spend a lot of time with other children who also love music. 
There are some downsides. The schools are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for students who live there. However, schools try to help parents with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want their young children to live away from home. School directors worry about admitting very young children because the environment is intense. They want to make sure children grow up to be well-rounded individuals. 
Being in a special music school can be stressful. Some children might lose interest in music as they grow older, and the pressure to succeed can be hard. Schools watch their students closely and offer help if needed. Many students enjoy the high-quality music teaching, but some feel that the academic subjects are not given enough attention. 
Musically talented children are often smart in other areas too. They might feel unhappy if their academic needs are not met. It might be better to wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves if they want to go to a specialist school. Children who are good at both music and academics might do well in a regular school with a strong music program. They can also take music lessons at music colleges on weekends. However, this might not be possible for families who live far from big cities."
FCE_25,B2,"Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her house has a big garden with many flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread everywhere. The garden has a nice mix of colors and shapes, thanks to the previous owners who loved gardening. They left plants that Susan likes, and she also kept their gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny didn't agree with some of her ideas, but when she explained she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants where they are, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. She says, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once."" She paints one flower at a time, which can take a few days, and then adds more flowers. Sometimes, it takes a couple of years to finish a painting. Her busiest time is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She finds the way flowers change as they age very interesting. For example, tulips change shape and open up after being in water for a day.
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She didn't like garden flowers back then because they looked fake to her. She was amazed by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places like rocks or cliffs. Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places like China and the Himalayas, but they grow well in her garden too. She is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause harm.
Susan is busy with two upcoming exhibitions and has a lot of flowers to paint. She finds it hard to find time to work in the garden, so she hired another gardener. But she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a 24-year-old from West Sussex. She works as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year doing this job. Sarah, also called Pilch, cooks and cleans for people who come to ski and stay in chalets. Chalets are wooden houses typical of the area. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more settled life. 'It's a good way to meet successful people,' she says.
Sarah does not live at the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then prepares breakfast for the guests. They get a full breakfast with porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She says cleaning is the hardest part of the job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. She tries to ski as much as she can. 'On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.'
Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower but does not nap because it makes her too tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans up and loads the dishwasher. 'I don't like coming to a messy kitchen in the morning,' she says. Sometimes she talks with the guests, and other times they prefer to be alone. 'Good guests can make the week great, but some weeks are not as good,' she says.
Sarah meets her friends at the chalet where she lives and they go out around 11 p.m. They visit places like Bananas, G Jay's, and Dick's T-Bar. But she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. 'It's a tough day,' she says, 'and you don't want to be tired when cooking breakfast.' On Sunday, work starts earlier because breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans the chalet quickly. 'We clean everything - clear breakfast, strip the beds, and get ready for new guests.' If she hasn't shopped on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., cleaning is done, and she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. 'I think the mountain air affects them,' she says.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it's time for dinner again and maybe a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,' she says."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is calm and peaceful, but here I was rushing around. Some of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job isn't like that. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking I usually clean cages or handle rats. I find magazines interesting, but I love my job at the zoo, so I'll stay there.""
Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived in leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I might work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""
Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, joined the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being in the fresh air. Sometimes, I don't see daylight because of my shifts. It was hard work but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn't know landscape gardening was so hard and needed careful planning. I'm more enthusiastic than effective, so I won't leave my nursing job.""
Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out tablets. I thought I might faint, but I was okay. The nurses' friendship is great, and it felt very 'girlie' compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital wasn't pleasant, but it was satisfying.""
Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and people suddenly respected me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from fitness training. On the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one adult.""
Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer. ""I was worried because I don't exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was surprised at lunch that some trainers didn't eat very healthily, but they drank lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this, but it inspired me to join a gym and be healthier."""
FCE_26,B2,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Memories**
**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I love the south of France and visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and into Italy. The views of the sea are amazing, no matter the weather or time of year. On the other side, you can see beautiful gardens and homes. It feels like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The people on the train are always interesting, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the beautiful journey.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have taken many train trips, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to the Kruger National Park because I was too young and had to stay with an aunt. When I moved to England as a teenager, I had never been on a train. London Waterloo was the first big station I saw, and its glass dome amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey through France and then by boat up the Nile to Luxor was the perfect way to relax after our wedding.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable, and the driver would wait for people to arrive before leaving. When the train came, many people climbed on, even on the roof for free. At night, the train passed through beautiful landscapes, like a dream, as if we were traveling on the moon.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people love trains from childhood, but not me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw few trains. As a teenager, I made a film in Yorkshire with a railway. The filming was on an old train line kept by volunteers. That's when I started loving steam trains. We rode the train whenever we could, and when I returned last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,B2,"'Want to get your story published? Our expert, Margaret Stubbs, has advice for you. Many readers ask, 'I wrote a story/book. Who should I send it to?' First, you need to research publishers and improve your writing skills. Selling your writing requires knowing the 'writing game'. Whatever you write, learn about the markets you want to target. The best way is to read a lot. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely helps you understand what publishers want. Keep updating your knowledge because new publications appear, editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. Publishers always look for new writers, so give them what they want. If you want to write short love stories, find out which magazines publish them. Get recent copies and learn what kind of stories they buy and who their readers are. Editors focus on what their readers want. Writers often ask me, 'My story was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?' As a former teacher, I never discourage anyone. But if your work isn't ready, it might not be published. Most new writers send their work too soon. If you've only written one story or article, it's unlikely to be published. Success usually comes after years in publishing or journalism. When you send your work, keep writing more stories. Each one will be better, and you'll gain confidence. Don't throw any away—improve them. I suggest not showing your work to others at first. Remember, every successful writer faced many rejections. Do everything to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course or join a local writers' group to get ideas and confidence. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"
FCE_4,B2,"On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore railway station, waiting for the 10.10 train to Philadelphia. The station was busier than usual. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and college students sat on the floor with their bags. A well-dressed, grey-haired man was talking to different people. He asked a woman sitting alone and then a girl near me if they were going to Philadelphia. The girl said she was going to New York. The man thanked her and moved on. 
I was curious about him. He asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said Wilmington. He didn't say anything and moved on to another couple. I was going to Philadelphia, but he didn't ask me. Maybe I looked unreliable to him. He seemed stressed and asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She said yes. 
The man asked her for a favor. I pretended to check my watch, even though I didn't have one. The woman seemed cautious. The man explained that his daughter was flying abroad from Philadelphia and had forgotten her passport. She called home from the station, not knowing what to do. He told her to stay there, and he would find someone to bring her passport. 
The woman asked why he didn't go himself. He said he couldn't leave his wife alone because she was in a wheelchair. This seemed like a weak excuse to me. The man was holding a padded envelope, which seemed suspicious. I silently warned the woman to be careful."
FCE_30,B2,"**Gary and Me**
John Moore, a restaurant owner, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef.
I think everyone gets a chance in life. My son, Gary, got his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was just what I wanted. Starting this business reminded me of my childhood. I remember my mother going to work in a factory, and I was upset because I was left alone. So, I thought, 'We need time for family life.' My wife took care of the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived above the restaurant then, and we always made sure to have meals together. This was very good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very confident. From a young age, they would come down and talk to our regular customers. This gave them a great start in life.
Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to work for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined. He used to wake up even before me in the morning. In a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even in charge. He would make over a hundred meals, and I knew he would go into catering because he had a talent for it. So when he told me, 'Dad, I need to do work experience for school,' I sent him to a friend who has a restaurant.
Gary recently started playing the drums and now has his own band. I wonder what will happen to his cooking if the music becomes successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to do two things at once, you might not succeed in either, so focus on what you know you can do well. I told him, 'Gary, if you want to achieve something in life, you need to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it might be too late.'
Gary went to catering college at 17, and on his first day, he and the other new students, who are usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He had prepared everything. That's my son! In the end, he was helping other people. None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. I'm very proud of him. I've always told him that if you want something, you have to work very hard for it because no one gives you anything for free. He saw the opportunity he was given and took it with both hands. You talk to your children as they grow up, and if they remember even a little of what you told them, you should be happy. The things Gary says and does make me think he must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,B2,"Finding a good apartment in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult, like finding gold during a gold rush. The best way to find a place is through personal connections: if you know someone who knows someone leaving a place, that often helps. But if you are new to Dublin, like Jo, you don't have any personal contacts to tell you about available places. So, you have to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt like she was stepping into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't question why she was going to Dublin. Everyone at her school assumed she would go. Who would want to stay in a small, boring town? That's what she heard for years. Everyone wanted to leave, see some life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them settle. But no one from Jo's year was going to Dublin. She was going alone. Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed in the hostel permanently because it was run by nuns, and she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because hostels were known to be cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn't know they were all thinking and talking about her as she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn't be too expensive. There wasn't a line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The fact that it said ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary. It was a red-brick terraced house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, who was obviously not chosen, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" ""Oh,"" said Jo and continued climbing. ""Hello,"" said a girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her type."" ""What did she do?"" asked Jo. ""Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline wore a very colorful shirt, almost as bright as her hair. Pauline was a punk, which amazed Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but never talked to one. ""I'm Jo, I work in the post office, and I called about the flat."" Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one said ""Nessa,"" one said ""Pauline,"" and the other said ""Other."" ""We'll put your name on it if you stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,B2,"'Behind the dolphin's smile People love dolphins. We like to see them in marinas, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about how dolphins are disappearing. Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart, understand human feelings, and make us dream of freedom in the sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest make us love them more. But these shows don't show the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas. The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think dolphins are protected by law and live in safe areas, but this is not true. Without plans to help them, dolphins might face a big disaster. There are 40 kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. The first two live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups. We don't know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were found on the Channel coast and in British rivers like the Thames. Now, they are only in Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few left have skin injuries, showing they are stressed. Dolphins have complex habits, making it hard to know why their numbers are falling. Overfishing is a big problem. It reduces fish stocks and threatens dolphins because they need to find food quickly. If fish are gone, dolphins might not survive. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they can't see. Modern fishing uses big nets that float or move fast in the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on French and Cornwall beaches, showing they died from getting caught in nets. Waste and chemicals in the sea can build up in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides dissolve in fat, so dolphins can absorb them. These poisons can pass to their young through milk. There is a case where a young dolphin died from its mother's milk. Another big threat to dolphins is human noise. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. Noise from ships and oil wells travels well in water and might disturb dolphins in ways we don't know yet.'"
FCE_51,B2,"**Getting Fit**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced when life feels busy and stressful. You might think this is just another article about fitness, but exercise is really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise and not many reasons not to.
Exercise makes your muscles stronger and changes your body shape quickly. It helps you stand or sit with good posture, which is how you hold your body. Good posture prevents muscle problems that can cause injuries. Exercise also helps your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.
You might have heard these reasons before and feel bored, but here are some more. Exercise can help with depression, tiredness, and sleep problems. It also helps control stress and can improve some medical conditions. Common sense should tell you that exercise is good for you.
There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or lifting weights. Be careful not to train too hard or with too much weight, as this can cause injuries. Start slowly and carefully. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.
Good posture is important for how you look and feel. A stiff or slouching body can be unattractive and have less energy. If you slouch, imagine a balloon pulling your head up to the sky. This helps you stand taller and breathe better. It also makes your body look slimmer.
Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps prevent injuries. Stretching should be part of your exercise routine and should be done slowly and carefully. The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,B2,"'IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their home comforts for months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest people to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained almost non-stop for six months, causing many problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive tool so that when their vehicle gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him out. Their teamwork has created some of TV's best wildlife films, like their popular film on leopards. Even while this film was being shown, they were already back in Africa, this time following the shy jackal. This is common for TV partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been going around the world to film exotic wildlife since TV began. I talked to Newman about their partnership while he was visiting a safari lodge. 'We sometimes argue but we get over it quickly,' he says about his colleague. Neither of them is the leader, and they get along well because they see animals in the same way. 'When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now we have a fixed camp, and since we start at 5 a.m. each morning, we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask.' Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. 'We can be out for up to eight weeks, so food can be a problem,' says Newman. It can be tough, but being alone in remote areas lets them get close to animals. Newman remembers filming a lion family where one lioness would greet their car as part of her routine. Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. Since then, they spend four months on location for each half-hour film. Before starting, they must submit a script for approval. 'Amanda and I have a good working relationship because we share the same ideas and vision,' says Newman. 'We want to make films that show the true spirit of the place and animals and touch people's hearts. I believe it's better to make people feel something than just think about it.'"
FCE_14,B2,"'The Netball Captain In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a typical day for the weeks before next month's World Championships: teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about her training place. 'Don't people look at you strangely?' I asked. 'I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice,' she said. 'I might see cars slow down, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,' says Kendra. I'm on a strict schedule to get very fit for them. These are her fourth World Championships, and they will be the biggest ever, with 27 countries taking part. 'We'll have home support, which is special,' she says. 'It's important to improve netball's reputation in this country. Playing here means more pressure. A home crowd will expect us to start well.' Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. We have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have lots of skill.' The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra says, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to play every day, with no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance, and you have to be ready.' In the fifteen years she has played at the top level, the sport has become harder and faster. On the court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't train so hard not to win,' says Kendra. But after the game, we are all friendlier.' Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. 'We must think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. As captain, I need a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. I support and encourage the team.' 'From the start, my netball career was carefully planned,' she says. So I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player. She will probably coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way.'"
FCE_63,B2,"Rachel Mills is a scientist who loves exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She works at Southampton University, teaching and researching marine geochemistry, which is the study of chemical processes in the sea. When she is not teaching, she goes on dives in a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, space is very tight, and she can touch the two pilots. They can't stand or move much and must stay inside until someone opens the door from outside. A dive can last 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.
If there is an emergency, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that quickly rises to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, and Rachel thinks it might not be a pleasant experience.
Rachel has made six dives so far. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, are many underwater volcanoes with chimneys blowing out black smoke. The Russian team was placing scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would drill a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She spends two-thirds of her time teaching, which she enjoys, but she does it to support her research on ""black smokers."" These are underwater volcanoes where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke, pouring out at one meter per second and at 350 degrees.
Rachel was scared once when diving with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a loud explosion. She thought she might die, but nothing happened, and they were relieved to be safe.
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she sees the chimneys through the porthole, she feels a sense of wonder. She studied black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., and seeing them in real life was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people decide what they think about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They look at how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our volume and tone of voice, and the words we use.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard to earn my degree. When I graduated, I was very confident."" She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. ""I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,"" she remembers. ""I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time."" Mary didn't get the job. Her friend, who also teaches at the school, told her the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview, you should try to look your best."" Many people forget how important it is to have a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but didn't even get an interview. ""I thought it was a mistake, so I asked the Director of Personnel what happened,"" she says. ""He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job, and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.""
Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went so well she was offered the job right away. ""I was delighted,"" she recalls. ""But I reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss saw how excited I was, he knew I wouldn't say no. So, he offered me a lower salary than I wanted. I'm sure I could have got more if I had controlled my excitement.""
Finally, what we say and how we say it is important for a successful interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. ""The annual report, for example, will tell you about the company's work. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will show your interest in the company."" Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confused sentences. As she says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points."""

Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. Painting started as a hobby, but he found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him, and he was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. Ron and his family moved to the north of England, where they didn't know anyone.

He was interested in health, so he visited top gymnasiums and talked to the owners. He knew he needed qualifications to change careers, so he took massage courses. He got a part-time job at the Life Centre and has no regrets. He feels in control of his life now and has peace of mind."
FCE_6,B2,"'Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always loved sports. I tried many different ones, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose to focus on running instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, it didn't get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It's fun because there are great facilities and nightlife there. But I have to be disciplined. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to get to the next Olympics - that would be amazing. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so you can't go to late-night parties. I don't mind that much, but I do love sleeping in, which I have to give up too. It's worth it because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I make sure to have a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship got me a TV show about surfing. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five guys on a boat, we have a lot of fun. We're traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some say we act childishly when we're out, but we don't look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about where we celebrate than how we did in the race. I'm away for eight months a year, so it's nice to come back and hang out with friends who do different things. You can't focus on the sport all the time - it's not healthy. I'm known in sailing, but I've only been recognized in the street a few times. I'd hate to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from people asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one. It takes time, but it's worth it. D Tomas (tennis player) It's great to walk on the court and feel the crowd's support. At the last tournament, it got a bit crazy with people crowding around. I still enjoy being noticed by fans when I'm out shopping. But it has downsides. My last girlfriend didn't like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that's why we broke up, I think. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn't bother me too much. I'm happy to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, because retirement comes early in this sport.'"

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff, and I feel guilty about buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get upset even before we leave home. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to make their own choices. I can't win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes during a supermarket trip. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to buying things, and they find it hard to believe that sugar is bad for their teeth when they see fun and exciting ads.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It's good for parents and children to talk about food because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents don't like competing with ads and having to say no to their children all the time.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, doesn't allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can't say, 'Tell your mum to buy this,' that's still what they want.""
Some parents find it stressful to decide which things to buy for their children and which to refuse. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food and ads, so they don't ask for things she doesn't want to buy. Parents also admit they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We say no to sweets because they're bad for him, but we buy chocolate and cream for ourselves. It's nice to buy good things, and it's normal for children to want that too. But I still get annoyed by their demands. It depends on how I feel. If I'm in a good mood, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas for children. Even if parents spend less because their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without a child's demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,B2,"'Luxury and Modern Technology at the Merrion Hotel The five-star Merrion Hotel has just opened in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four big old houses into this new hotel. The hotel has the latest technology for both staff and guests. The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by name. For other details, like what guests like, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps treat returning guests in a special way, as expected in a five-star hotel. The system cost £250,000, but MacCann believes it will be worth it. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them next time. This is because of the guest-history feature, where staff can save guest preferences. Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can change the temperature a little themselves, or the front desk can adjust it more. Business guests will like the technology in their rooms. MacCann thinks 65% of the hotel's business will come from business travelers. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing tool. Technology changes fast, so the hotel has prepared for future updates. Extra cables are ready for new technology. TVs are rented, not bought, so they can be replaced easily. DVD players can also be updated. Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The 145 bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and welcoming. The hotel also has a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food at the hotel must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who already had two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This is good for both him and the hotel. He got to design a new kitchen and has better parking. The hotel gets a popular restaurant without financial risk. With technology and a great staff, the Merrion is likely to do well.'"
FCE_40,B2,"**Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the fullest to share how they do it.
**A. Jeanette Kupfermann - Journalist and Author:**  
""I get energy from excitement. I need to do things that challenge me. Learning new things gives me a lot of energy. I also get energy from rhythm, like when I learn flamenco dancing. Dance is great because it's expressive and gives you energy. If you're bored, you might feel tired. Doing something useful, even if it's small, gives you energy.""
**B. Linda Kelsey - Magazine Editor:**  
""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it, so it doesn't feel hard. If you like what you do, you don't feel down, even if you're tired. I need a good amount of sleep to feel good. When I only get six hours of sleep, I feel tired. Exercise gives me energy, but it's hard to start. I do yoga once a week and try to exercise at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I feel tired in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, so I think it's good to eat something then.""
**C. Annie Nightingale - Disc Jockey:**  
""I don't eat healthily for energy; I think it's my natural enthusiasm and being positive. I don't like negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and live in the moment. Enjoyment is important. I set goals and enjoy my work. The last two years have been exciting. I work with lively young people, which is energizing. I love being busy and social. I enjoy taking photos and writing imaginary song lyrics for fun. It helps me relax when I travel.""
**D. Floella Benjamin - Author and Children's TV Presenter:**  
""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in my work and family life. Being positive helps. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Energy is like a natural chemical that comes from talking to others. Smiling at people and getting a smile back feels great. I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, but I don't have an exercise plan. I get my exercise by playing with kids.""
**E. Deborah Moggach - Author and Playwright:**  
""I love making a garden from a wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a garden by breaking the concrete and adding soil. It was better than any workout. I also get energy from knowing people want to read my writing. I find it hard to write if no one is interested. I like exploring places like farms or woods. If someone finds me, I say, 'Oh, I didn't know it was private.' It's fun and makes me feel like a child.""
**F. Katherine Monblot - Therapist:**  
""I believe you should be interested in and respect what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't like makes you tired. I used to be on committees and didn't like the time they took. You only have so much energy, so use it for things that matter to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until about 200 AD when iron skates came to Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, the upper classes thought skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was more about style, but in the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie made it more athletic. This made skating more popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both beautiful and physically challenging.
For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and knees bent to keep your weight centered. Your body should lean a little forward. Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It’s quite easy, right? As you practice, you can make your movements longer.
Learning how to fall is one of the first skills for skaters. Even the best skaters fall. To avoid injury, try to be relaxed when you fall. This helps reduce the shock of hitting the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand.
Once you can skate confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer lessons to help you learn the basic moves, and soon you can try turns, jumps, and spins.
Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To be like them, you should do regular exercises. It’s dangerous to skate with a stiff body, so warm-up exercises are important. Focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also strengthens your heart, lungs, and body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it’s a great way to stay healthy and fit."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can make anyone emotional. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.
**A. Annika Reeder, 15**  
Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The work is very hard now. I don't have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gym and school. I try to take each training day by day. When I'm very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can't take too many days off, or you get stiff.""
**B. Annika's Mother**  
""Annika showed great potential from a young age. Some parents push their kids, but it doesn't work. To perform like Annika, you have to want it yourself. People say we've given up a lot, but they don't see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was shy and hid behind me, but now she's met people worldwide and gained confidence.""
**C. Sarah Stokes**  
Sarah started show-jumping at ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It's good my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere. Shows last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love show-jumping events, they are exciting and fun. Even without my parents, I would do it because I'm determined. My goal this year is to join the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
**D. Sarah's Mother**  
""Sarah loved horses from age 1. At 5, she would get up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, you have to jump all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is well-organized and happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
**E. Jane McShane, 10**  
Jane is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it's fun. When I play, I don't concentrate much. I should, but I just look around. I'm not worried about being proud; I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like embarrassment.""
**F. Jane's Mother**  
""Jane played her first chess game at 5. My father said, 'Let's see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by 6, she was beating adults. I'm happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop, I wouldn't stop her. I don't want to hold her back because she's special. If she has this gift, let her reach her potential."""
FCE_29,B2,"'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every ten years, people in Europe grow about one centimeter taller on average. More and more tall people are being born each year. This doesn't mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are now losing the effects of many years of poor diet, which is having a big impact. 'We are starting to reach our true potential,' says Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived 40,000 years ago.' For most of history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. About 9,000 years ago, farming began, which changed everything. Most green areas were taken over by farmers, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our calories. This poor diet has hurt our health and bodies. Over time, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing, was actually bad for health, some say. Still, farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. Most people on this diet were poorly nourished, but this is only now being addressed, even in rich countries. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets becoming like our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has problems. People are taller, but beds are still 190 cm long, as they have been since 1860. Leg-room in planes and trains seems to have gotten smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products. The question is: how tall will we get? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. Since the climate warmed, we have become thinner and smaller, even with good food. As the planet heats up, we might shrink more. So, global warming could stop us from growing taller.'"
FCE_57,B2,"'Studio Audiences What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV life, but many people don't understand them. When we see them excited on game shows, we wonder - who are these people? Some people think studio audiences are not very important. I've heard that even TV workers don't respect them much. I thought studio audiences were just people wanting a little fame. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from all backgrounds and jobs. TV shows try to get different people for different shows. Some of us who like watching TV at home don't understand why anyone would go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in an uncomfortable studio to watch something you can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV for a moment. I didn't believe this until I talked to Angela. Why did she come? She wanted a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Few of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it's like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH - and you clap or laugh. This might be true for some shows, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We hope a show is good enough not to need these signs.' Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', and Charlotte liked feeling part of live TV. 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing live actors because I could only see the back of someone's head. The first scenes were so far away that I watched on a studio screen. Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch TV, but that's not the point. For most people, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment.'"

I don't like places that are completely wild. I like places where people have made a mark. It's the same when I travel to other countries. I like pretty villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Riding my bike was a way to escape school. I loved exploring the lonely hilltops, the safe valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. That was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.

There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by people who love trains. I always travel first class because it doesn't cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery is not amazing. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when our small train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers can see people doing everyday things, like making tea or doing the dishes. I see myself through their eyes, a woman in a tiny train, looking into other people's homes. It's the normal landscape that I like. Just fields, sheep, and a faraway grey sea. It makes me look closer to find something that surprises me.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so not many people come here. A few brave surfers visit, but most people come to enjoy the beauty of the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and is known for shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast that you can combine with trips inland through beautiful, damp valleys full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering places with a family who owns some property in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there and not many visitors either. It's a hidden place, empty and far away, and I like the feeling of space. I found the area by accident when I was a student, and since then I've visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted pure peace and to reconnect with my English roots and feel at home. I grew up in what is now called Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never ride past: if you went down the driveway, you'd never return. That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magical, hidden, romantic house. You can't hear anything except the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"Title: A Day with Animals
We are a family that loves animals and enjoys having them around. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was excited because she found a pine snake and asked if we could keep it. I said yes, but only for one night. We have a special tank for animals we find, so we can look at them and learn about them from our natural history book.
I got home late and started cooking when I heard my sons shouting for help. I ran to their room and saw our cat, Domino, with a white mouse in his mouth. The mouse was a gift for Mother's Day. Domino was running around the room, trying to find a place to enjoy his catch, while the kids were waving their arms to stop him. I tried to help but tripped and fell on the floor. Then I noticed the snake was escaping from its tank.
The room was chaotic with the cat, mouse, kids, and the snake all moving around. The dog was barking too. I quickly turned off the boiling pot in the kitchen and came back to the room. I managed to catch Domino by the tail and saved the mouse, which was unharmed. Interestingly, this mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life.
Feeling confident, I tried to catch the snake. It was not easy, but I sat on the floor and slowly calmed the snake. Eventually, I picked it up and took it to the garden. I hoped it would go to the garden shed, but when I let go, the snake wrapped around my shoulders like a scarf. My eldest child, DJ, said, ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""
We all helped the snake move towards the shed. It slowly climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake vanished, my three-year-old, Clay, said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"" We all agreed."
FCE_59,B2,"'Write me a letter! In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old way of writing letters might disappear. But for me, getting a letter is special. There is the excitement when it arrives, the happiness of seeing who sent it, and the joy of reading it. I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote a letter every week, and so did my mother. Sometimes my father wrote too, and his long, funny letters were always a joy to receive. Most letters from home talked about everyday things happening with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters most. I also got letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, I often had boyfriends who were away for work or study, so we stayed in touch by writing letters. Writing letters seemed to make our relationships better. I found it easier to express myself in writing than in talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it's even better to get a year's worth of news! It's even more exciting when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, someone I trained with over 20 years ago. I also have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's a lady who writes to me from France. We started talking in a restaurant on the way home from a holiday. My husband took her photo, and I asked for her address. If she hadn't replied, we wouldn't have this friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French (she doesn't speak English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success was this summer when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a friendship could last so long through letters. The local newspaper even wrote about it on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing the tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"
FCE_54,B2,"Title: Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art
In the French Alps, there is a special place called Mont Bego. Here, you can find 36,000 ancient pictures carved into rocks. These pictures are very old, about 4,000 years, and show cows with horns, fields, and gods and goddesses. This place was once used for prayer and worship. 
However, these important pictures are being damaged by careless tourists. People are writing graffiti on them, stepping on them, and even taking pieces home as souvenirs. Some tourists rub the drawings to make them clearer for photos, which harms the art. Others scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.
Experts are worried about how to protect these drawings. Jean Clottes, an expert on rock art, says that if the damage continues, the drawings might disappear in 50 years. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way to save the site is to stop people from visiting, except on guided tours. But Clottes disagrees, saying this would upset local people.
David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He suggests letting people visit but admits it's hard to stop them from causing damage. He thinks charging a fee might help, but there is no government money to pay for guards.
Annie Echassoux, another researcher, is worried because tourists can now reach the site more easily by hiring vehicles. She believes the area should be roped off and guides provided. She insists that money must be found to protect the site, as it is a historic place. If nothing is done, future generations might lose these ancient drawings."

FCE_65,B2,"'Climbing Walls In the past, climbers went to mountains. Now, you can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, people watch as French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by two fingers on a climbing wall. This arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, and both events have something in common - The Wall. This is possible because of new technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs with good climbing angles. In winter, they either climbed in cold weather, walked, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. When cliffs were not usable, they used brick or stone buildings to practice. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom. Soon, sports centers started building walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges. Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He used natural rock set in concrete blocks for the wall. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had problems. These walls were only vertical, unlike real cliffs with overhangs and angled rocks. Also, once built, they couldn't be changed, and climbers got bored with the same holds. In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a material shaped like real cliff holds. These could be attached to any wall and changed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started using panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for overhanging walls, but steel frames could be set up anywhere. This system allowed climbers to have new holds all the time.'"
FCE_61,B2,"'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is 'risky.' Acting is indeed a risky career because there are more actors than jobs available. When you decide to become an actor, some friends might say you're crazy, but others might support you. Everyone will give different advice. Becoming an actor is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your decision and reaching your goal. There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee you will succeed. Success depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and glamorous, with the chance of earning a lot. People often ask what talent is. I think talent is natural skill plus imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. Talent also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theatre, the important thing is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to act. If you ask actors how they succeed, they might not know. They understand their skills and techniques but know they are only as good as their current job. Fame can be temporary. Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs. Then you get an audition, but you might not get the part. Actors often don't talk about their chances. They find ways to handle the stress of auditions and rejection. Nobody likes being rejected. Remember, rejection is possible from the first time you try for a role. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. If you don't care enough, no one else will care for you.'"

FCE_28,B2,"'It's true - we're all getting taller Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, 'Do you want to be the flagpole on a ship?' because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every ten years, people in Europe grow about one centimeter taller on average. More and more tall people are being born each year. This doesn't mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are now losing the effects of many years of poor diet, which is having a big impact. 'We are starting to reach our true potential,' says Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist. 'We are becoming like the Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived 40,000 years ago.' For most of history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, farming began, which changed everything. Most green areas were taken over by farmers, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - give us more than half of our calories. This poor diet has hurt our health and bodies. Over time, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that left us underfed. In Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, once thought a blessing, was actually bad for health, some say. Still, farming spread because it could support more people than hunting and gathering. Only recently have wealthier countries started to improve diets. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are now more like our ancestors' diets. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has problems. Beds are still 190 cm long, as they have been since 1860. Leg-room in planes and trains seems to have gotten smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products. The question is: how tall will we get? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. Robert Fogel from the University says it could be 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. But scientists say that while individuals are getting taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. Since the climate warmed, we have become thinner and smaller, even with good food. As the planet heats up, we might shrink more. So, global warming could stop us from growing taller.'"

**The Farmer**
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years, but it became boring and not fun anymore. He didn't plan to leave for another five or ten years, but he lost his job unexpectedly. He didn't get much money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. His big chance came when he met the head chef of a local hotel with a top restaurant. By supplying them, his reputation grew, and now he also sells meat by mail order. He is happy not to be in an office anymore, but he still works 80 to 90 hours a week and sells a product.
**The Painter**
Ron Ablewhite was a manager in advertising but now works as an artist. Painting started as a hobby, but he found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him, and he was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to work for money. Ron and his family moved to the north of England, where they didn't know anyone.

FCE_5,B2,"Title: A Childhood Game Becomes a Business
Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are turning a childhood game into a successful business. They live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and love playing an old game called pichenotte. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family played it often, especially on weekends and holidays, and had a lot of fun.
When the family moved to New Mexico, they continued playing pichenotte. The game was new to people in the southern USA, and visitors were curious about it. Three years ago, Dave noticed their old game board was damaged, so he made a new one. It was so nice that a relative and a friend wanted one too.
To see if more people were interested, the brothers took the game to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people were unsure about playing, but once they tried it, they loved it. Dave found out that pichenotte is similar to a game from India called 'carroms'. It was adapted in Britain as 'squails' and brought to Canada by British immigrants. In Quebec, it became known as pichenotte.
Pichenotte is a game of skill for two to four players. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks', which they flick across a board with their fingers. The goal is to get the pucks into a small hole for 20 points. There are also rings worth 15, 10, and 5 points, and small posts that make it harder. A game usually lasts two minutes.
Seeing how popular the game was, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. The game became so popular that championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. The boards sold quickly, so the brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and costs $595 on their website.
There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope their business will grow. They dream of one day replacing their workshop with a luxury car. Until then, they enjoy playing the game that might make them rich."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first come to the Model Village, it's hard to believe that a few years ago, this place was just empty land, covered with wild plants. People thought it was useless land. But one man, with the help of his wife, worked hard to turn it into the beautiful place you see today. They moved a lot of soil and clay to change the flat land into the nice landscape you see now. Machines like bulldozers helped, but there was also a lot of hard work by hand. After shaping the land, they brought in about 1,000 tonnes of good soil to make the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens.
Many trees and bushes were planted in the Model Village. They had to choose plants that could live in the salty air near the sea and survive the strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some came from far places like Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims thought of the whole village, and he made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting from when the village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to last in all weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how materials would last in changing weather, but soon he became an expert too.
You will see that the models are all made to the same scale, and even the smallest details are carefully done. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and known for its high quality. The techniques used here are now used in other model villages in England and are even taught in some schools.
All the model buildings show traditional British architecture but are not exact copies of real places. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. It looks like manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest part of the village.
Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; a small mistake can mean hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead. 
To make your visit more fun, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press them to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your thoughts. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village more interesting. We also want to know if any models are not as good as the others, so we can fix them. We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!"
FCE_69,B2,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. Sometimes pop stars pose for photographers, but this is not common. Usually, these pictures hurt famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. The PCC was created to handle such issues. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where she expected privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she didn't. It is surprising that the PCC did not investigate on its own. They should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on these and other unfair stories? At first, this seems like a good idea. It would lead to many decisions against newspapers. These decisions would be reported by other newspapers and on TV and radio. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as they would not make money by hiding and taking pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a 'police officer', there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it ask the victim to complain? And if the person still refused, should it continue anyway? Also, celebrities and royalty might expect every story about them to be investigated and be upset if it wasn't. The role is too big. How could the PCC watch over all British newspapers and magazines? There is also the embarrassment factor. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet. They might have a worse story they want to keep secret, and they know it might come out if they complain. In this way, even the PCC might seem like an enemy. A British comedian also suffered when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, or later, when his family was photographed on holiday. He was afraid the newspaper, News of the World, would show the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', saying it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he should have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

FCE_17,B2,"Title: How to Become Confident
Confident people might seem like they were always confident, but many have learned this skill. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
A. Jenny
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At 25, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous but did well, and someone suggested I take a university course. I was scared on my first day, but my confidence grew, and I became more outgoing. Working at the school changed my life and helped me become more confident.
B. Michaela
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and acted too aggressive at first, thinking that's how confident people behave. But I learned that confidence means believing in yourself. If work is too much, I don't feel bad about leaving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something hard, I remind myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to overcome it.
C. Lisa
People think I'm confident, but the calmer I look, the more scared I am. In TV, looking confident is important. Interviewing people taught me that everyone gets nervous, and we feel better when talking to friendly people. My mom once told me, ""Who's looking at you? Everyone's worried about themselves."" This advice helps me. You gain confidence by facing your fears. I was nervous for my driving test but passed, and now I feel less scared.
D. Barbara
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but it took time to build. By doing my job and learning from mistakes, I became more confident. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me, and that's okay. You should like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses that boost my confidence. Setting small goals helps me see my progress, instead of aiming too high and achieving nothing.
E. Kim
After college, I worked as a secretary and was too scared to speak in meetings. Eventually, I found the courage to share my thoughts. When I started in politics, I was nervous about speaking in public. I told myself, ""People do this every day, so you can too."" Writing notes helped me feel more secure. Everyone feels nervous about public speaking. The secret to confidence is telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,B2,"'Visit to Malaysia Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. 'You should keep it,' he said, 'it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it ... and I have many more.' He showed me a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat next to them under the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. In the middle of the beach were 10 platforms, where helpers held the kites, and a line of competitors waited for the start. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered and the kites flew up like rockets. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying skill. 'Flying kites isn't hard,' said Adnan, 'but making them needs real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' I accepted his invitation. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur into the mountains with thick rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A boat was there to take people across. Nearby, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed to a path into the forest and said: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' Before starting, I didn't know that most of the path was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who took care of a tented kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects under my thin mattress. The night was very dark, full of sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and made noises. In the morning, there was a great view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning hit the treetops. Soon, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the heavy rain. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, people asked me questions: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' But they were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I remember it more for its kind people.'"

Everyone goes shopping, even if they love it or hate it. But people shop in different ways. Do you know what kind of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people ...
**A. Melanie, 22, dancer**  
I love shopping! I can't stop spending money. When I have money, I go shopping, and it makes me happy. I find it hard to walk past sale signs without buying something. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We are both addicted to shopping!
**B. Brenda, 40, office manager**  
I don't like shopping much. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he wants. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all like different things. I don't often spend money on myself, so when I do, I feel guilty and don't tell my husband the real price. The real price always seems too high.
**C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager**  
I only shop for things I really need. I don't like shopping and only go when I must. When I shop, I know exactly what I want and won't buy anything else. I find shopping tiring and would rather do something else.
**D. Anita, 35, TV producer**  
I like to look around shops sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and shop quickly. I do have some clothes I bought by mistake, so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes makes mistakes!
**E. Lizzie, 41, secretary**  
I don't like shopping at all. I really dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want, and nobody helps me. The shops are too noisy and messy, and I find it very stressful. Luckily, I don't have to shop for clothes often because most of my clothes are gifts. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish quickly.
**F. Lisa, 22, actress**  
I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go shopping with my friends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually have a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I'll buy it.
**G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**  
I'm a careful shopper. I like shopping, but I don't buy a lot. I usually know what I want and don't spend too much. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but I often feel worse because I spent too much money!
**H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**  
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it's too busy. I'm a careful shopper. I usually know what I want before I go, and I don't buy things right away. I like to check other shops to find a better deal, so I take a long time.
**I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
I'm not a fan of shopping. Maybe because I work in the city center, shops don't interest me anymore. When I have to shop, I do it quickly and don't try clothes on because it's too much trouble. Sometimes the clothes I buy don't fit, but I don't mind. I'd rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of time shopping."
